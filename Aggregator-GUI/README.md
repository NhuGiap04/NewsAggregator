# GUI GUI GUI GUIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

GUI for News Aggregator app. Again, don't forget to install Maven,
**JDK 20** and JavaFX. And environment variables.

Open Terminal in this folder.
```commandline
mvn compile
```
```commandline
mvn exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="com.example.demoproject.AggregatorMainClass"
```

Common issue? Idek where to start...
