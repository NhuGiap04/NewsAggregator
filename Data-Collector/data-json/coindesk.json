    "content": "Bullish bitcoin (BTC) undercurrents lurk below the boringly calm crypto waters, setting the stage for a potential outsized price rally.\nThe percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply active onchain within the last month fell to a record low of 5.4% early this week, according to Blockware Solutions and Glassnode. In other words, fewer coins are changing hands, indicating supply-side weakness. At press time, bitcoin's circulating supply was 19.48 million.\n\"Price is set at the margin, which means those who trade Bitcoin back and forth drive short-term price action. As supply-side illiquidity continues to increase, as indicated by fewer supply exchanging hands, any demand catalyst will send the price skyrocketing,\" Blockware Solutions said in an email.\nThe percentage of circulating supply that has remained inactive for over a year stands near 70%.\nBuy and hold remains a preferred strategy in the crypto market, with the so-called long-term holders controlling over 75% of the circulating supply. Glassnode defines long-term holders as addresses that hold coins for at least 155 days.\nAwaiting bullish catalysts\nBesides the potential spot bitcoin-exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch, which is several months away, macro and regulatory concerns favor the bears.\n\"The macro scenario has never been murkier and the 'higher for longer' general mood could keep a lid on risk assets, including crypto,\" David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said in a note to subscribers on Tuesday.\n\"There's also some potential selling pressure coming from government-seized wallets, chapter 11 portfolios, and large token unlocks over the next 6-12 months. Finally, there's uncertainty on whether more regulatory action is coming in the U.S.,\" Lawant added.",

    "summary": "Ethereum's gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas that can be expended in an individual block. A limit increase could improve network capacity and potentially reduce costs for users.",
    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested raising the network's gas limit by 33% on Wednesday – a move that would raise the network's transaction capacity and could reduce fees for end-users, but could increase operational costs for validators.\nUsers of the Ethereum blockchain pay gas fees to ensure that their transactions are added to the network, and the gas that one pays to execute a transaction roughly correlates to its computational complexity (e.g. a simple token swap will cost less gas than opening up a convoluted lending position).\nEthereum's gas limit refers to the total amount of gas that can be squeezed into an individual Ethereum block – the bundles of transactions that get added to the Ethereum network at regular intervals. Increasing the gas limit would mean increasing the amount (and complexity) of transactions that can be added to a block.\nButerin made the gas increase suggestion during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session featuring the Ethereum Foundation Research group.\n\"The gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, which is the longest time ever in the protocol's history,\" Buterin wrote in response to a commenter who asked whether Ethereum could \"safely increase\" its gas limit. Buterin suggested increasing the gas limit to 40 million gas units – a 33% increase over today's 30 million limit.\nA ramp-up in Ethereum's gas limit wouldn't require a big update or \"hard fork\" of the network's core code. Instead, the validators that operate the network should be able to implement the change by adjusting certain parameters in their node software.\nCalls for increasing the gas limit started back in December when some of Ethereum's layer 2 (L2) networks were experiencing record usage. Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis Chain, wrote on X that for “Ethereum to become a settlement layer for L2s it needs to increase its block gas limit.”\nFollowing Buterin’s Reddit comments on Wednesday, more users on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, chimed in with words of support for the suggested increase. Jesse Pollak, the head of protocols at Coinbase and creator of the layer-2 blockchain Base, shared his support of the move and suggested the gas limit could even be increased even further, to 45 million.\nOthers expressed more caution about the gas change, like Ethereum core developer Dankrad Feist, who suggested that calldata and blobs per block should be targeted in addition to the overall gas limit.\nAs for what the limit increase accomplishes, \"it simply allows more activity on L1 - it will either reduce tx costs - or more likely IMO just increase capacity at similar cost -> more burn,” said Köppelmann.",

BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Lloyds Banking Group and others collaborated with Swift on the experiments.\nFinancial institutions around the world are increasingly experimenting with asset tokenization with the goal of improving financial markets. A recent report from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said tokenization could help improve efficiency and transparency in bond markets.\n\"For tokenization to reach its potential, institutions will need to be able to seamlessly connect with the whole financial ecosystem. Our experiments have demonstrated clearly that existing secure and trusted Swift infrastructure can provide that central point of connectivity, removing a huge hurdle in the development of tokenization and unlocking its potential,\" Tom Zschach, chief innovation officer at Swift said in a press statement.\nSwift used Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect with different blockchains. Chainlink’s CCIP, which is designed to help build cross-chain applications and services, went live in July.\nA report on the Chainlink and Swift experiments emphasized the need for regulatory clarity on tokenization and said that future work will require a greater focus on data privacy.\nUPDATE (Aug. 31, 13:44 UTC): Adds detail from report in last paragraph.",

The first round of minting includes hemp, psychedelic mushrooms and kratom.\nThe minting is done through its Certificate of Analysis (COA) as a non-fungible token (NFT) verification system. The first minting includes hemp, psychedelic mushrooms and kratom for U.S. hemp and cannabis lab, ACS Laboratory. The hemp, cannabis, mushroom and Kratom industry faces supply chain transparency challenges according to the company’s website. ACS tests for potency, assurance of no chemicals or pesticides in the products.\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nThe aim of minting the certifications is to allow users to trace the COAs back to the original laboratory, access product’s test results and avoid fraudsters from exploiting the COAs through QR code tampering or data alterations, the press release read.\nSundie Seefried, CEO and president of Safe Harbor Financial, previously said in an interview with CoinDesk that a regulator expressed to her that crypto and cannabis could be a good match because blockchain technology provides a good traceability factor for funds derived from cannabis plants.\nThe way that the process works is Blockticity prints a QR code on the products and the QR code then links to a COA minted as an Avalanche NFT. So far, ACS Labratory has used Blockticty to mint over 35,000 COAs which accounts to a value of around $275 million.\nThrough minting a COA onto blockchain that is coming from the lab, Blockticity authenticates the report from the lab. Companies can then look up a COA and use the QR code to find that report owned by the firm who paid to perform the test, according to a previous statement.\nACS Laboratory’s next 120,000 scheduled COAs are for cannabis, according to the press release.\n“We’re pleased to join forces with Blockticity once again, harnessing this avant-garde technology for our esteemed clients,” said Roger Brown, president of ACS Laboratory. “This technological leap allows any COA viewer to trace its origins and detect any discrepancies.”\nACS Laboratory and Blockticity previously collaborated in November 2021 to launch its first national hemp COA as an NFT on the NFT platform Moonwalk.",

    "title": "4 Actual Use Cases for Blockchain and AI That Are More Than Just Hype",
    "summary": "Blockchain and AI could be the 21st century's most culturally significant pairing that could change the way we think about creativity, identity and verification.",
    "content": "Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are little more than bundles of computer networks and code, but they sure are becoming important players in nearly all aspects of online life.\nAn estimated 66% of the world’s population uses the internet for everyday activities like shopping, social connection, healthcare, business and entertainment. Additionally, at least 7 billion devices are connected to the internet through sensors and custom-designed software, comprising a growing cadre of gadgets referred to as the internet of things (IoT).\nAll this activity means one thing: data. Lots of data. As WIRED put it in 2014, data today is as valuable of a commodity as oil was in the 18th century. As of 2023, more than 11,000 marketing solutions exist simply to capture, track, analyze and report on consumer data to yield profitable insights.\nBlockchain, an open-source globally distributed ledger, offers us a new place to store all that data where it might finally be independent of third-party companies that place profit incentives over consumer privacy. Yet, data on blockchain is publicly available by default – which is not ideal for most of our information. This transparency is causing many of us to think critically – perhaps for the first time – about what types of personal data we want to exist on the internet and how we should renegotiate Web2’s social contracts that have allowed centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter to own our data in exchange for services.\nThat’s where artificial intelligence (AI) could come in. In an ideal future, third-party companies don’t track and analyze our data – AI does. Let’s imagine, in this ideal scenario, that we understand well enough how AI learning models work and therefore trust them to develop insights about who we are while tracking digital provenance and verifying the credibility of our information.\nSounds great, right? But unfortunately, most new AI use cases are still experimental and nobody can predict success. As happens with new technologies, the true capacities of AI and blockchain are currently getting lost in hyperbole, misunderstandings and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). We spoke to several data experts and Web3 insiders to better understand where AI and Web3 might successfully converge to create consumer-friendly solutions for verification, ownership and creativity.\nNews verification\nWith the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, the issue of deep fakes and misinformation has become a grave concern. But what if we could publicly track the origin of information?\nAccording to Lisa DeLuca, senior director of engineering at Web3 domain company Unstoppable Domains, not only does the source-tracking technology exist, but there’s also a way to link news quotes to the public key of the person who said it.\n“We've got a pending patent for this idea that you can use blockchains to add trust to content,” DeLuca said. Similar to a Google Search Alert, a person could employ an AI bot to crawl the web for mentions of their name in the media. Any time that person is quoted by a journalist or news outlet, they would receive a request to verify the quote on the blockchain using their decentralized domain name linked to a crypto wallet.\n“You'd see a request that says, ‘Is this really you – yes or no?’ And then the experience could be updated to show that that person verified it, and then the news outlet could develop their reputation over time on how much of their content is actually verified versus rejected,” explained DeLuca. The process could also be incentivized with crypto tokens so that the verifying person receives a reward for confirming their quotes.\nAccording to DeLuca, Unstoppable Domains has already developed this tool and is ready to begin testing it with a media partner. “If someone wants to partner with us, we're ready to talk about it,” she said. “This is not that far off.”\nCopyright and intellectual property protection\nThe digital world has long grappled with copyright infringement and intellectual property (IP) challenges. The convergence of Web3 and AI might be ushering in a new era of copyright protection.\nRecently, comedian Sarah Silverman sued OpenAI and Meta over their AI models that were trained using her book, which is copyrighted material. While copyrighted materials often end up online and publically available, there ought to be ways for owners to regain control over their materials and dictate if, how and when they are used.\nAccording to Don Gossen, CEO of data tokenization company Nevermined, the convergence of AI and blockchain could empower creators of all kinds to monetize their IP in terms they control. Smart contracts on the blockchain could automatically enforce copyright terms, while AI algorithms could scan content for potential infringements. This combined approach would create an immutable record of ownership and usage on the blockchain, simplifying disputes and incentivizing creators to share their work in a secure environment.\nAt present, Nevermined is testing this concept with scientific research, in a growing initiative known as decentralized science (DeSci). Using an AI learning model to compile data from lengthy research papers, programmers can create short-form abstracts for clinicians to quickly look up information in real-time healthcare settings. To maintain the integrity of the data, as well as compensate scientific authors, Gossen says that participating contributors could choose whether to include their copyrighted academic papers and research materials, thereby contributing to a well-curated dataset that produces high-quality outputs as a result.\nNevermined is currently working on a blockchain-based marketplace, in which AI developers would need to subscribe to get access to these materials and train their models. This approach gives the power to the original authors and owners of the content, who ultimately get to decide if they would like to grant others access to their materials.\nAdditionally, because blockchain can provide proof of reference, Gossen explained that a doctor could also deep dive into the original research to understand more, and possibly even reach out to the researchers.\n“Commercially, this is useful because hospitals and clinics will pay for the abstracts for their medical professionals to access,” Gossen said. “A doctor can excuse themselves from the patient meeting, go to the back office and query the symptoms, receive a bunch of research, and then have five minutes to synthesize the information and go back to the patient with an assessment.”\nInteractive NFTs: Enhancing digital collectibles\nIf you’ve ever wanted to create your own version of Clippy, the Windows paperclip that popped up inside Microsoft Word, now you can. When coupled with AI, the blockchain-based artworks known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can become more interactive and dynamic, unlocking a world of imagination and fun for creators, brands and consumers.\nAlethea AI, the company behind intelligent NFTs (iNFTs), developed generative NFTs powered by large language models (LLMs), or deep learning algorithms that distill large data sets. It’s sort of like taking a version of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular chatbot, and combining it with your favorite digital artwork, thereby teaching the art to converse through text and verbal cues. That’s how Alethea AI’s generative NFTs work, and they can feature a holder’s favorite NFTs as avatars.\n“Basically, how an iNFT is created is you take your NFT and combine it with what we call intelligence pods,” explained Komalika Neyol, Alethea AI content manager. “These pods are AI assets that can be trained. It can have a personality and perform AI services for you.\"\nAccording to Neyol, iNFTs are customizable to a user’s unique dataset, allowing holders to showcase their personalities, knowledge and skill sets through their NFT. For instance, a philosophy professor could upload their PhD dissertation to their LLM and create an animated chatbot that greets website visitors by quoting famous philosophers.\nInterested users can create customized NFTs with their own unique dataset by minting an Alethea Intelligence Pod NFT. The company created a short tutorial video for holders on how to imbue an ERC-721 NFT with AI.\nSmart contract security – with a caveat\nIn a future where smart contracts automatically divvy up and disperse payment to the appropriate crypto wallets as the experts we spoke to describe, auditing the security of smart contracts is going to be essential.\nAccording to Ron Bodkin, co-founder and CEO of generative AI company ChainML, AI can be highly instrumental in detecting the anomalies of smart contracts. Chain ML is currently working with the Web3 security company Cube3 to more efficiently block malicious crypto transactions.\nSimilar to the safeguards implemented by a bank, programmers can train an AI to interpret factors that might be red flags, such as a suspicious origin of a transaction, the age of a wallet, the sequence of events (e.g. a prompt to drain a wallet right after interacting with a new address) and more.\n“There's so many different factors that can come together to say, ‘Hey, this is risky, this is something that you want to deal with,’” said Bodkin.\nHowever, Bodkin acknowledges that while AI can enhance the efficiency of blockchain security audits, humans are still necessary to conduct a thorough evaluation. His advice is to use AI technology in a way that improves human error, but don’t expect AI auditors to replace humans entirely.\n“I wouldn't suggest anyone fire your auditor and just rely on AI audits,” Bodkin cautioned. He says ChainML and its partners are beginning to see success from performing AI audits earlier in the building process, thereby helping human auditors address problems quicker, but the process would not be possible with robots alone.\n“AI auditors could run all the time and very quickly give responses,” Bodkin said. “There's a number of layers where AI can enhance security.”\nBottom line\nThe convergence of blockchain and AI presents a brave new world, one full of exciting possibilities that have the potential to reshape various sectors. News verification, copyright protection, interactive NFTs and smart contract audits are burgeoning areas that demonstrate the tangible benefits of this Web3-AI synergy.\nHowever, while the possibilities are vast, experts advise businesses and creators to be careful and consider AI’s technological limitations. Presently, AI is about supplementing human productivity, improving error and expanding the imagination — and they’re unlikely to fully replace humans anytime soon.",

    "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Frax Finance released a singularity roadmap on Friday to boost the total dollar value of crypto assets locked in its layer 2 blockchain Fraxtal to $100 billion by the end of 2026.\nAs of the time of writing, the so-called total value locked (TVL) in Fraxtal was $13.2 million, according to data tracked by DefiLama.\nThe roadmap proposed launching 23 layer 3s within a year and new assets like frxNEAR, frxTIA and frxMETIS. The existing assets, FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH, and the new ones will be issued on Fraxtal going forward, the proposal floated by founder Sam Kazemian and other contributors added.\nLayer 3 protocols provide decentralized applications with a highly customizable and interoperable network built on top of layer 2 scaling solutions.\nKazemian also called for reviving a mechanism to share the protocol revenue with stakers of its native tokens.\n“We propose that the protocol fee switch be turned back on, with 50% of the yield flowing to veFXS and the other 50% used to buy FXS and other Frax assets to pair in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE),” the proposal said. “FLE will allow Frax to continue building its balance sheet while significantly increasing the liquidity of FXS and its paired Frax assets.”\nFXS is the governance and utility token of the Frax ecosystem. FXS holders who lock their tokens receive veFXS, which can be staked on the Ethereum mainnet and Fraxtal.\nBesides, the plan details how new tokenomics will fully collateralize Frax’s stablecoin FRAX, one of the top 10 dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in the world, and boost yields on staked FRAX (sFRAX).\nFXS changed hands at $1.35 at press time, representing a 2% gain on a 24-hour basis. The cryptocurrency has declined 14% this year, underperforming the CoinDesk 20 Index, which has rallied 41%.",

    "summary": "The number of BTC held in wallets tied to crypto exchanges has declined by 4% this month, data tracked by CryptoQuant show.",
    "content": "The number of bitcoin (BTC) held in addresses tied to centralized exchanges slid to the lowest level in more than five years, partially reflecting a growing market sophistication.\nThe so-called exchange reserve dropped 4% to 2 million BTC ($54.5 billion) this month, the fewest since early January 2018, according to on-chain data analytics service CryptoQuant.\nThe decline represents both positive and negative developments, including the rising popularity of services like crypto custodian Copper's ClearLoop, which allows users to trade without moving funds to centralized exchanges.\n\"It partly reflects the increased demand for services like Copper's Clearloop, which requires only a minimum of coins to be posted on exchanges, that are a natural progression of the crypto market where exchanges will have to work with lower balances,\" said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport. \"Over time, this will make crypto currency's exchanges less important and exchanges might have to find new business models to keep profitability high.\"\nMatrixport joined ClearLoop in May, offering institutional clients off-exchange settlement.\nLack of trust\nSince Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange, FTX, went bust in November last year, investors have increasingly preferred to keep coins off centralized exchanges. From what we know now, FTX, formerly the world's third-largest exchange by volume traded, commingled user funds, denting investor confidence.\nAccording to Thielen, the dwindling exchange balance represents that.\n\"The misusage of customer funds through the FTX leadership has reminded investors about the importance of self-custody,\" Thielen told CoinDesk.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers' annual global crypto hedge fund report published last month showed that most industry players now prefer multiple forms of custody with \"only 9% of the respondents leaving coins exclusively on exchanges.\"\nMarket-neutral, discretionary long-only strategies, quantitative long/short and discretionary long/short strategies overwhelmingly prefer third-party custodians. Among the four, funds with a long-only strategy hold the fewest coins on exchanges, in both commingled and segregated accounts.\n\"It seems the overwhelming majority of crypto hedge funds are seeking to mitigate as much risk as possible after the events of last year, keeping only those assets required for day-to-day trading on-exchange,\" the report said.\nOne interpretation of a dwindling exchange balance is that it indicates investor preference for taking direct custody of coins to hold them for the long term in anticipation of a price increase. In other words, it shows investor confidence in cryptocurrency's long-term prospects. That bullish interpretation is still valid, according to Thielen.\n\"After the 2022 price declines, investors are taking a buy-and-hold investment approach,\" he said.",

    "content": "U.K. Member of Parliament Natalie Elphicke called for the government to do more for blockchain on Thursday at an event conducted in the Thames Pavilion which resides in the House of Commons where lawmakers meet.\n“Now, I want to see the U.K. doing more to harness the power of blockchain technologies, to be that leader, to mark that step change because it's vital that industry and policymakers work together to advance understanding and the application of the technologies,” Elphicke said at an event in London hosted by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Blockchain Technologies she chairs. The blockchain APPG is a cross party group, similar to the crypto APPG.\nBlockchain is a sector that Elphicke said she sees a lot of potential in. She said it could provide increased transparency in global supply chains or be used for digital identity and data purposes.\nOther countries have been taking on legislation addressing blockchain technology issues. The Deploying American Blockchains Act, a blockchain-friendly bill, received unanimous approval in a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives this month. Meanwhile, Belgium’s government announced last month it wants to boost European blockchain infrastructure.\nThe U.K. needs to match the pace that international regulators are taking to move forward, Elphicke said. She also called for the U.K. to collaborate with other countries on blockchain issues.\nThe U.K. has done little in terms of blockchain policy but has said it wants to be a crypto hub – a view the U.K.'s new economic secretary, Bim Afolami, reiterated recently. The country is planning on regulating the sector in phases, starting with legislation for stablecoins being introduced early next year. It’s not clear when more blockchain policies may be enacted in the U.K., though a bill that paves a way for blockchain technology to be used for transporting trade documents recently passed in the country.\nThe blockchain APPG group also plans to launch round table discussions next year, as well as ask the industry to weigh in on how the U.K. can harness skills, opportunities and diversity in blockchain, Elphicke told CoinDesk at the event.",

    "summary": "DOGE's new-found stability reflects lack of investor interest in trading alternative cryptocurrencies.",
    "content": "Volatility in dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme cryptocurrency by market value, has dwindled so much that it now looks more stable than the digital asset industry leader, bitcoin (BTC).\nAccording to TradingView, DOGE's annualized 30-day realized, or historical, volatility was 30% at press time, notably lower than bitcoin's 35%. Realized volatility is calculated as the standard deviation of the daily percentage change in an asset's price over a specific period.\nDOGE has historically been more volatile than bitcoin, scaring risk-averse investors, understandably so, as BTC has been around since 2009 and has evolved as a macro asset, with increasing institutional participation over the past three years. DOGE, meantime, has been seen as a non-serious crypto project since its inception in 2013.\nThe meme coin's new-found status as a less volatile asset shouldn't be taken to imply market maturity, and probably stems from a lack of investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin's dominance rate, or the share in the total crypto market, has surged to 50% from nearly 40% this year, a sign of liquidity being drained from alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin. While the BTC price has gained 60% this year, DOGE has lost just over 12%, CoinDesk data show.\nKey liquidity metrics like the aggregate 1% market depth tell the same story. That metric measures the bids and asks within 1% of the mid-price for all order books on major crypto exchanges.\nThe aggregate 1% market depth for the top 10 altcoins was well below that of bitcoin and ether at the end of last month, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko.\nThere has been a market-wide decline in activity, with trading volumes in the spot market hitting a four-year low of $475 billion in August.\nThe low liquidity in DOGE and other coins is consistent with the murky regulatory outlook for smaller cryptocurrencies. Early this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its lawsuit against leading digital assets exchanges Coinbase and Binance, referred to several altcoins as securities. DOGE and SHIB were not mentioned, but potential stricter regulations for altcoins could eventually affect meme coins.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin miners have been running down inventory in a rising market, moving away from the accumulation strategy seen before the prior halving in May 2020.",
    "content": "Bitcoin miners are depleting their coin stashes, possibly to ensure the sustainability of operations in the face of the impending halving of per-block rewards from April 20.\nThe number of bitcoin held by miners, which receive the coins in return for validating transactions in the blockchain block, declined to 1.794 million BTC this week, the lowest since early 2021, according to data source CoinMetrics.\nThe so-called miner balance has fallen by 27,000 since November, implying steady selling in the months leading up to the quadrennial mining reward halving. The pivotal event is set to reduce the per-block BTC emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.\nThe drawdown in balance contrasts the steady accumulation of about 25,000 BTC in the five months leading up to the previous halving, which occurred on May 11, 2020.\nThe change in strategy stems from bitcoin's recent rally to record highs above $73,000. The cryptocurrency has surged 63% this year, surpassing the previous cycle peak of around $69,000 well before the halving. Historically, new highs have come months after the halving.\nThe rally has allowed miners to take profits at higher prices and fund equipment upgrades to prepare for the reduced rewards rate, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.\n\"With miners' holdings still near an all-time high in USD terms ($124 billion), this sell-off appears to be a strategic move for profit-taking and operational upgrades, marking a behavioral change from the last cycle,\" Wintermute said in a weekly newsletter.\nThe upgrades are evident from the rise in the hashrate, or the total computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions, on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThe hashrate has increased by 45% to over 600 exahashes per second over five months, registering a more significant growth than the 15% increase seen ahead of the previous halving.\n\"The consistent rise in hashrate suggests that some of the miners are either adding or upgrading their equipment to mitigate the impact of the upcoming halving on revenues,\" Wintermute noted. \"This early investment reflects a positive future outlook and a strategic shift toward long-term operational resilience.\"\n11:49 UTC: Corrects second para to say the balance has dropped to lowest since early 2021.",

    "content": "Ethereum scaling firm Polygon released a toolkit for developers to help them build blockchains fueled by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.\nThe Chain Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source codebase that developers can use to create their own customizable layer 2 chains using Polygon’s ZK technology. These chains will be connected to each other through a ZK-powered bridge, so every chain would be interoperable, Polygon said in a press release. Together, they will form what Polygon is calling the “Value Layer.”\nThe announcement comes as other layer 2s, like Matter Labs’ zkSync and Starkware’s Starknet, are coming out with their own ZK-powered toolkits for developers to build their own chains. Matter Labs’ ZK Stack is already live, while Starknet’s package will be released to the market soon.\nPolygon turned heads in 2021 with its main proof-of-stake network, seen by many developers and crypto-market analysts as one of the most promising ways of scaling Ethereum. But blockchain developers have since moved to promote a more closely connected type of layer-2 network known as \"rollups.\" Polygon has adapted to the trend, launching its own rollup while also explicitly embracing zero-knowledge cryptography as a core element of its technology roadmap.\nPolygon also has a toolkit for developers to create customizable chains that are application-specific, called “Supernets.”\nBut the scaling team is betting that CDK will be the next evolution, given that it uses ZK proofs, and that “all existing Supernets can upgrade current architecture to leverage the industry-leading ZK technology of Polygon,” the company said.\n“The goal is simple: build the Value Layer of the Internet, a core protocol that makes creating, sending and receiving value of any kind as seamless and functional as sending or receiving information over the Internet,” Polygon said in a press release.\nRead more: ZkSync Developer Releases Toolkit for Building Ethereum Rollups",

    "title": "How a Ph.D. Student's Research Paper Turned Celestia Into $345M Blockchain Project Overnight",
    "summary": "This week's launch of the new \"data availability\" network Celestia came with an airdrop of the project's TIA tokens, one of the most anticipated giveaways in the crypto industry of the past year.",
    "content": "Mustafa Al-Bassam was a Ph.D. student in computer science in 2019 at University College London when he published a paper titled \"LazyLedger.\"\nNot meant for a lazy reader, the paper went on to describe, in excruciatingly complex terms and Greek mathematical characters, what was then a radical rethinking of how blockchains could work: separating out the various functions of a distributed ledger – especially the way users query the network for data – into distinct \"application layers.\" A key benefit would be to minimize the total resources needed to run the main blockchain.\nAl-Bassam now serves as CEO of Celestia Labs, the primary developer behind the Celestia project, which launched this week as a new \"data availability\" network, and in various pronouncements heralded the accomplishment as the start of a new \"modular era\" in blockchain architecture.\nIt's presumed that a primary use case for Celestia will be to relieve the Ethereum blockchain of the burden of storing and transmitting reams of data produced by the fast-growing ecosystem of \"layer-2\" networks known as \"rollups,\" where users can make cheaper and faster transactions.\n\"The theory is that Celestia can become the backbone for a highly scalable and interoperable network of rollups and, most importantly, achieve this modular vision without sacrificing decentralization or security,\" Christine Kim, a vice president of research at the crypto firm Galaxy, wrote in an Oct. 19 report.\nOf course, this being crypto, the primary focus of most news coverage (and social-media posts) was on the project's buzzy airdrop Tuesday of some 60 million of its native TIA tokens, or roughly 6% of the supply, with a final tally of some 191,391 claims. Another 140 million tokens will be allocated to future initiatives.\nRead More: Celestia Airdrops TIA Token as Network Goes Live, Claims Start of 'Modular Era'\nThe airdrop was so highly anticipated that, in the lead-up to the giveaway, traders were speculating on the price using pre-launch futures contracts. According to the website CoinMarketCap, the TIA token has already been listed on a host of crypto exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, Bybit and MEXC.\nAs of late Tuesday, CoinMarketCap listed the project's circulating supply of TIA tokens around 141 million, and price of $2.44 each, for a market capitalization of $344 million.\nThe airdropped tokens represent a portion of a total of 1 billion tokens minted, and this being crypto, just over half of those are getting allocated to early investors and initial contributors. Many of those are locked up for now: Seed investors will receive their tokens evenly between October 2024 and October 2025, with initial core contributors receiving their tokens until October 2026.\nThe TIA airdrop is one of the biggest in the crypto industry over the past year, and of course a big airdrop is no guarantee of a project's ultimate success.\nTwo mammoth projects, Sui and Aptos, both layer 1 blockchains staffed by former Meta employees, have similarities with Celestia in that they airdropped tokens to developers and test network users, but they have struggled to wrangle market share from the likes of Ethereum.\nAptos rose to a market cap of $2.9 billion on the release of its main network while Sui debuted at $750 million. Yet in spite of inflated token values, the total amount of capital locked on either blockchain has failed to surpass $100 million.\nWhat does Celestia do?\nOn Tuesday, X (formerly Twitter) was filled with go-go posts – \"$10 soon,\" wrote one user in reference to TIA's price. Another poster asked where they could dump the airdropped tokens. Jesse Pollak, who oversees Coinbase's new Base layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum, offered congratulations.\nSuch euphoria may have served to gloss over the reality of just how hard the project is to understand.\n\"Data availability\" is such an arcane term that even Dankrad Feist, an Ethereum Foundation researcher who's the namesake for the equally arcane blockchain concept of \"danksharding,\" said recently that he found it too confusing.\nSean Farrell, a crypto analyst at FundStat, simplified it for investors in a note on Tuesday: Data availability \"allows network nodes to download, store, and make transaction information accessible for verification.\"\nThe big idea is that Celestia aims to help solve scalability and stability issues that have plagued monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Solana – partly by creating a new venue for hosting and accessing the reams of data created by the rapidly proliferating ecosystems of \"layer 2\" networks working atop primary \"layer 1\" blockchains.\nData availability is considered so crucial to alleviating the load on Ethereum that two rival projects, Avail and EigenDA, are working on it in addition to Celestia. Avail is headed by a former Polygon co-founder, Anurag Arjun, while EigenDA is a project of EigenLayer, headed by Sreeram Kannan, an associate professor at the University of Washington.\nThe push to erect these new networks reflects this year's push by developers toward a \"modular blockchain\" architecture that separates the core functions of a blockchain – consensus, settlement, data availability, and execution – and then segment them into layers that ensure efficiency.\n\"It's the start of a new era,\" the Celestia Foundation, which supports development on the network, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"The modular era.\"\nRead More: What Is Ethereum’s ‘Data Availability' Problem, and Why Does It Matter?\nHow does Celestia work?\nAccording to the Celestia’s project documentation, the TIA tokens represent \"an essential part of how developers build on the first modular blockchain network.\"\nTo use Celestia for data availability, rollup developers submit a type of transaction known as \"PayForBlobs\" on the network for a fee, denominated in TIA.\nModular blockchains are designed with a focus on using specific channels for speed and execution, unlike monolithic blockchains that can only scale at the expense of decentralization or security.\n\"Instead of one blockchain doing everything, modular blockchains specialize and optimize to perform a given function,\" Celestia spokesperson Ekram Ahmed told CoinDesk.\nAl-Bassam, the former Ph.D. student who went on to found Celestia, co-authored three academic books with the Ethereum's famous founder. Vitalik Buterin. In a talk earlier this year, Buterin touted Celestia as a scaling solution for Ethereum rollups.\nOn Tuesday, the official Celestia account on X posted: \"What was once considered a wild moonshot is now a reality four years after the LazyLedger white paper was published.\"\nWhat sets Celestia apart from other blockchains?\n\"Data availability sampling answers the question,\" Ahmed replied before highlighting the importance of verifying data on a blockchain. \"Users of a monolithic blockchain usually download all the data to check that it is available.\"\nCurrently, this problem isn't necessarily in the forefront of the mind of Ethereum or Solana users, but that may be because neither blockchain has scaled to the masses. Ethereum averages around 1 million transactions per day, according to ycharts, with Solana racking up a fraction of that.\nLast week, fund manager VanEck modeled a scenario that would see Solana reach 100 million users. If blockchains manage to scale to this level, projects like Celestia aim to ensure that the data for every blockchain node is verified and validated.\n\"Modular chains solve this problem by making it possible for users to verify very large blocks using a technology called data availability sampling,\" Ahmed said.\nThe flagship feature of Celestia is data availability sampling (DAS) – a way of verifying all data that is available on a blockchain.\nIntended users include those running so-called light nodes – able to be run on small computers that don't need massive amounts of computational power or data-storage capacity – who could then verify data availability without having to download all data for a block. These light nodes conduct several rounds of random sampling of block data, as more rounds are completed it increases its confidence that the data is available.\n\"Once the light node successfully reaches a predetermined confidence level, for example 99%, it will consider the block data as available,\" Ahmed concluded.\nEventually, if Al-Bassam's vision takes hold, day-to-day crypto users might interact with Celestia without knowing it. And understanding it all? Seems a lot less likely.",

    "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has never been shy about trashing crypto, even while his giant Wall Street bank became a leader in using blockchain technology to move billions. At a U.S. Senate hearing Wednesday, he slammed the industry again, to the delight of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is trying to impose restrictions to combat illicit digital transactions.\n\"I've always been deeply opposed to bitcoin, crypto, etc.,\" he told senators in a hearing examining the U.S. banking industry. \"If I was the government, I'd close it down,\" he declared.\nLined up with other big-bank CEOs before the Senate Banking Committee, Dimon argued that the crypto industry gets to \"move money instantaneously\" without going through the regulatory conduits required by bankers, including sanctions and money-laundering controls. He contended that the primary use case for digital assets is criminality.\nSen. Warren jumped in to get Dimon – a longtime adversary of the progressive Wall Street critic – and other CEOs to agree with her that crypto businesses should have to follow the same anti-money-laundering rules under the Bank Secrecy Act that other regulated financial firms do. That's the main thrust of legislation she's been pushing, which industry lobbyists have countered would rope in crypto projects that have no ability to comply, effectively killing them off.\nThe bill has some overlap in other crypto legislative efforts, but an aggressive effort to impose such restrictions probably won't find sufficient backing in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, so it isn't likely to move toward law in the near term.\nMeanwhile, Dimon's bank – which has over $3 trillion of assets, more than double the market cap of all crypto assets combined – is a major player in Wall Street's race to move their businesses onto crypto-powered infrastructure. The company just said its JPM Coin is conveying $1 billion per day, and JPMorgan's Onyx division is exploring how to meld traditional finance with blockchains.\nDimon has long differentiated between \"crypto\" and \"blockchain,\" the ledger technology that serves as the foundation for cryptocurrencies and something Dimon argues is a useful tool.\nRead More: JPMorgan Adds Programmable Payments to JPM Coin",

The metric peaked above 70% with the debut of nearly a dozen spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in mid-January and has been falling ever since.\nSince late December, the percentage of the circulating supply that has not moved in at least two years has declined to 54.% from 57.4%.\nThe decline likely represents profit-taking by investors who held coins for one year and over and marks a shift from the holding strategy seen through 2023.\nThe urge to sell likely stems from bitcoin's massive 148% price surge since April last year and the 50% rally since the ETFs began trading in the U.S. At press time, bitcoin changed hands at $70,400. However, it's difficult to ascertain the exact percentage of bitcoin that left the inactive supply has been liquidated in the market.\nAccording to the data tracking website MacroMicro, a decrease in the percentage of inactive BTC is a \"leading indicator for the end of the bull run.\"\nPast data, however, show that bull markets tend to peak as the percentage of inactive supply bottoms out and begin rising.",

    "content": "Blockchain activity tied to MakerDAO's maker (MKR) token is signaling caution to bulls following MKR's 45% price surge in four weeks.\nThe number of MKR held in wallets controlled by centralized exchanges has increased by 5% to 71,190 MRK ($106 million) in the past 24 hours, taking the total exchange balance to the highest since Sept. 3, according to Coinglass. MakerDAO is one of the largest crypto lending protocols and issuer of the $5 billion stablecoin DAI. MakerDAO's sDAI represents DAI deposited in the protocol's DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module.\nThe notable spike in the exchange balance may breed price volatility, mainly to the downside. An increase in the so-called exchange balance is widely taken to represent investors' intention to sell or liquidate their holdings or deploy coins as a margin in derivatives markets.\n\"An inflow of MKR moving to exchanges is something to be cautious of for at least a temporary local top,\" analytics firm Santiment tweeted, noting the recent rise in MKR's price and active addresses.\nThe previous spikes in the exchange balance, seen in late last month and mid-March, marked interim price tops, as seen in the chart below.\nMKR has been on a tear since defending the psychological support level of $1,000 late last month, thanks to its investments in the short-term U.S. Treasury notes, which are now yielding over 5%.\nAccording to data tracked by Parsec, MakerDAO has invested more than $2 billion of its vast stablecoin reserves in U.S. Treasury notes.\n\"MKR continues to enjoy a strong first-mover advantage having invested over $2 billion in short-term bonds through off chain structures since February 2022,\" Parsec Research's weekly note dated Sept. 22 said.\n\"With such a large RWA [real world assets] portfolio, MKR is able to offer a 5% Savings Rate on DAI and buy back MKR with surplus profits. The success of sDAI and a constant flow of MKR buybacks (thanks to the Smart Burn Engine) has led to continued MKR outperformance relative to its DeFi 1.0 peers,\" Parsec added.",

    "title": "Ethereum's Daily Transaction Fees Drops to 8-Month Low of $2.8M",
    "summary": "Ethereum's daily total fees fell to 1,719 ETH ($2.8 million) on Sunday, the lowest single-day total since Dec. 26.",
    "content": "Ethereum, the world's largest programmable blockchain and the parent platform of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency ether (ETH), is the cheapest to use in eight months.\nThe total daily fees, paid by users for executing transactions on Ethereum, fell to 1,719 ETH ($2.8 million) on Sunday, the lowest single-day total since Dec. 26, according to data tracked by South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. The tally is down 89% from the year-to-date high of 16,720 ETH observed on May 5.\nEthereum uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves validators instead of miners to create and verify blocks of transactions. Therefore, validators, entities that help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH, receive transaction fees, but not in full. They get the priority fee or the tip that users add to the base fee to entice validators to prioritize their transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is burned, taking ETH out of circulation.\nA decline in the total fees paid represents low network usage, as fees are determined by the level of activity in the network, mainly the number of pending transactions.\nThat said, the eight-month low in fees probably stems from the rising popularity on the Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions, a long-term positive development for Ethereum.\n\"Ethereum L1 fees since friends.tech launched on August 10 are 25% lower than the average for the year until then, which is in stark contrast to the times when the success of early NFT application CryptoKitties or the latest Yuga Labs NFT drop would commonly temporarily clog the Ethereum network,\" David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said in a note last week.\n\"From a broader perspective, seeing such a successful application gain meaningful traction without congesting the underlying blockchain network is encouraging. This, ofcourse, comes on the back of the development of Ethereum's L2 scalability solutions: Friends.tech is built on top of Base, which is Coinbase's L2 chain that uses the Optimism stack,\" Lawant added.\nFriend.tech debuted on Aug. 1, gaining over 100,000 users and accumulating more than $25 million in revenue within two weeks. Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum and Base helps scale Ethereum, alleviating congestion and keeping transaction costs under check on the main network.\nPer data tracked by analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the number of daily transactions on Optimism Mainnet hit a new all-time high of nearly 900,000 transactions on Aug. 15. Further, the number of transactions processed between Ethereum mainnet and the major layer 2s using optimistic rollup technology hit their second largest value in history early this month.\n\"As competition between L2s grows, it becomes clear that Ethereum benefits,\" IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter dated Aug. 18.",

    "title": "Ahead of EU Elections, Crypto Industry Pushes Blockchain Merits as Policy Focus Shifts to AI",
    "summary": "Industry watchers are hoping for a younger, tech-savvy cohort of politicians that can drive innovation-friendly policy forward.",
    "content": "The European Union’s more than 370 million eligible voters are set to elect 720 parliamentarians this June – and while tech policy focus has shifted to artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain industry bodies are vying to prove the technology is vital to the bloc’s digitization efforts.\nThe EU has already established the world’s first comprehensive crypto rules alongside strict anti-money laundering measures for the sector. But with revisions to the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation likely in the works and the legislation's two key architects’ political futures up in the air, Europe’s crypto industry is bracing itself for change.\nChange could mean a number of things, including the industry potentially losing the handful of lawmakers who really know crypto or a slackening of new policymaking. More challenging still is getting ahead of shaping the sector’s new role in a discourse centered on artificial intelligence (AI) – something the EU has already started legislating.\nEarlier this year, four leading EU industry groups joined forces to pen a manifesto pledging to promote the use of blockchain tech in the bloc to avoid falling behind “in the global race” towards a digital economy.\nThe groups say the timing for the manifesto is “crucial considering the upcoming elections and political changes Europe will undergo” this year and makes a case for continuing work on blockchain.\n“While we recognize the intrinsic value of technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and robotics, we believe that blockchain will serve as the trust layer for the convergence of all these technologies, allowing them to build upon each other and form the framework of the future digital economy,” the manifesto said.\nYoung blood\nThe associations’ hope is that a new and hopefully younger parliament will be easier to approach than the last – at least where digitization is concerned.\nFor crypto and blockchain policy in particular, political parties may matter less than lawmakers’ age, according to Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe, one of the four industry associations that collaborated on the manifesto.\n“If you have a wallet full of crypto, you're much more open to the idea that this will be part of the future economy, right? Because you have it, you know how it works, you understand it,” Kopitsch said during an interview with CoinDesk.\nMarina Markezic, co-founder of the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), which also collaborated on the manifesto, says younger politicians are likely to be more tech-savvy as well.\n“So it would be, like, kind of also easier to explain, to talk to them” about blockchain technology, Markezic said.\nBut first, things overall might potentially slow down, according to Benedikt Faupel at German digital industry association Bitkom, “just because we don't know how the elections play out.”\nMiCA architect up for re-election\nCrypto policy in the European Parliament (EP) didn’t have a lot of support to begin with and was spearheaded by “mostly three or four people,” Markezic said.\nKopitsch and Markezic agree that Greek politician and former EP Vice President Eva Kaili was crypto’s driving force in government. Kaili’s dismissal from Parliament over a high-profile corruption scandal was seen as a blow to policy efforts, but thanks to German lawmaker Stefan Berger, MiCA made it through to the end of the line.\nBerger, who was the rapporteur for the package and in charge of handling the framework through negotiations, helped stamp an effort by the EP’s Green politicians to limit the use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism that would have effectively banned Bitcoin in the union.\n“He did so much,” said Markezic, referring to Berger’s work on MiCA.\nBerger is currently rapporteur for the EU’s legislative proposals for a digital euro but is also up for re-election this June. According to Jonas Gross, head of the Digital Euro Association, the outcomes of an election of this scale are tough to predict, and it’s “infeasible to discuss specific officials who might not be back this year.”\n“We do see that the European Parliament is currently – under the guidance of Stefan Berger – following a very innovative and open-minded approach when it comes to crypto assets, stablecoins and the digital euro,” Gross added. “It would be desirable to get a Parliament in place that has a similar innovative focus to bring these digital money-related topics further forward so that it benefits the EU.”\nAnother architect of MiCA whose future is up in the air is Mairead McGuinness, who serves as the commissioner for financial stability. MiCA was proposed by the European Commission under McGuinness’ purview. She has said she won’t be contesting in the 2024 parliamentary elections but is open to staying on another term as Commissioner – though that decision ultimately rests with the EU's overarching government.\nDigital euro\nWith MiCA mostly out of the way, another key framework for some crypto watchers is the EU’s push for a central bank digital currency, which is stoking controversy – and even conspiracy theories – with some politicians raising concerns that a digital euro could give the EU governments too much power and access to private information.\nAccording to Anne-Sophie Gógl, executive board member of the Digital Euro Association, some right-wing political parties are using plans for a digital euro to “create a mood against the European Union.”\n“They are using words such as control and surveillance. They also accuse the digital euro of excluding marginalized groups,” Gógl said in a written statement. “We fear that this trend will also have an impact in Europe after the elections: a larger proportion of right-wing populist representatives in the EP and therefore the risk that the topic of the digital euro will be misused for misinformation.”\nPolls are projecting rising support for the far right, but likely not enough to tip the scales in favor of anti-EU sentiment this election.\nIf these parties do snag a nice chunk of new seats though, it could “massively slow down the policymaking process” for a digital euro, Gógl said.\nPositioning blockchain in AI\nThe EU’s tech policy priorities have shifted away from crypto to focus on AI, and the crypto industry is pushing for the application of blockchain technology in conjunction with AI, according to Anja Blaj, policy expert at EUCI.\n“What we are arguing most of the time is that AI alone raises a lot of fears as well, and how those fears can be quite often addressed is through blockchain technology,” Blaj said, referring to arguments that blockchain could be used to help preserve the integrity of data fed to AI systems and decentralize them.\nThis won’t be the first time industry bodies pushed for the acceptance of blockchain technology over the adoption of speculative assets. During the last bear market, which saw several crypto giants fall, the industry quickly pivoted to promoting blockchain applications in traditional finance and other areas at events such as the World Economic Forum.\n“What people are actually moving away from is the financial connotation of the blockchain industry. So quite often, we actually push for the narrative of focusing on the ReFi of regenerative finance… supply chains or how, for example, data can be handled,” Blaj said during an interview with CoinDesk.\nRegenerative Finance (ReFi) sees cryptocurrency projects investing in sustainability in an effort to fix some of the problems markets create.\nSetting up blockchain as something vital to the digitization of Europe may prove critical to the industry’s survival in the region.\nWhen the current government was formed, “there was a lot of hype around blockchain,” and Europe was the first to get moving on policy and initiatives, Markezic said.\n“Now it is more on AI and… why would you use your political power in order to talk about something that might not be that present anymore?” Markezic said of the risk of fading political interest in blockchain.\nThe elections will take place from June 6 to 9.",

    "summary": "In a new blog, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlines a stealth address system that can help overcome the blockchain’s lack of privacy protections.",
    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released a new blog post over the weekend proposing a \"stealth address system\" for enhanced privacy protections for blockchain users.\nIn his writing, Buterin notes that assuring privacy remains a big challenge for the ecosystem, and that “improving this state of affairs is an important problem.”\nStealth addresses are generated by wallets and muddle public key addresses in order to transact in a private way. To access these private transactions, one must use a special key called the \"spending key.”\nPrivacy has been a big concern for the Ethereum ecosystem, given that transacting on the blockchain is public. There are already some privacy mechanisms. One notable example, Tornado Cash, has limits, Buterin noted, saying it can only hide “mainstream fungible assets such as ETH [ether] or major ERC-20s.”\nStealth addresses would provide a mechanism to also add privacy protections to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain names.\nToni Wahrstätter, an Ethereum researcher who also reviewed Buterin’s blog post, told CoinDesk: “Stealth addresses have great potential to be used in every transaction in which the interaction between two parties should not be revealed to the public.”\nWahrstätter emphasized the need for the stealth address system for the expansion of everyday crypto use: “In particular, think of donations or simply payroll checks,” highlighting that users may not want others to see their personal transactions on a public blockchain.\n“For example, when I buy a coffee at the supermarket, I might not want the supermarket to know my employer, how much I earn and what I spend it on,\" Wahrstätter added. \"Stealth addresses are yet another, quite straightforward tool to increase the overall privacy in the network.”\nRead more: Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto",

    "summary": "But it probably won't – for blockchain bonds, tomatoes or whatever.",
    "content": "This week, David Solomon (DJ D-Sol if we’re using stage names), chairman and CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs, proved he’s stuck in the past with a Wall Street Journal opinion piece he penned titled: “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto.” The article was published on the heels of Goldman saying it’s planning to spend “tens of millions” on discounted crypto investments.\nIn the article, Solomon correctly points out that blockchain came in and disrupted heavily regulated industries like banks. Oddly, he goes on from there to claim that the deafening call for regulation means young “blockchain organizations” won’t be able to keep up with regulatory requirements. And that is especially true of cryptocurrencies, but we “shouldn’t miss the forest for the trees” – that is, we should recognize that blockchain can “support responsible innovation across the financial industry” without cryptocurrencies.\nWe’ve heard that one before: “I don’t know about this bitcoin thing, but there’s surely some potential in the underlying blockchain technology!”\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.\nTo defend his position, Solomon shared how Goldman Sachs used a private blockchain to arrange a 100 million euro two-year digital bond for the European Investment Bank that was settled in 60 seconds instead of the usual five days. Praise be to its private blockchain!\nThe takeaway is supposed to be that Goldman will use a private blockchain to reduce settlement times, ultimately lowering costs for all stakeholders.\nExcept.\nThe reason bonds settle in five days is not because of the lack of a blockchain; it’s because of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Adding a private blockchain isn’t going to rid Goldman Sachs’ bond placement process of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Especially when that deafening call for regulation is answered.\nSure, maybe adding a blockchain is a solution, but really, it’s not for one main reason: Private, permissioned blockchains are worse than useless.\nRead more: How I Lost My Faith in Private Blockchains\nBlockchains have killer apps – but this isn't it\nDon’t let anyone trick you; blockchains are not a complicated idea. If you know what a database is (an electronic repository of data), then you basically know what a blockchain is. Databases store data in a place. You or Goldman Sachs can access that data electronically if the database manager allows you access to that data. Otherwise, no data for you or Goldman Sachs.\nBlockchains are the same thing, but all the data is public and copies of the database are stored in many disparate places. In theory, just about anyone can join and maintain their own copy of the data on a computer they know and trust.\nIf that sounds like a very narrow, minimal-potential use case and potentially slow technology, that’s because it is. There’s no need to allow everyone to have non-permissioned access to every piece of data all the time unless you are trying to get around needing a database manager or some other trusted third party to access that data. Something like digital money could be a good application of this technology.\nAnything else, you’re better off with a regular database.\nReally, the takeaway here is that blockchains are yet another round of narrow, minimal-potential-use-case technologies getting shoved into all sorts of broad applications where they simply shouldn’t be shoved. (Cue the conversation about pairing artificial intelligence with our drinking water, or whatever).\nShipping company Maersk and tech giant International Business Machines tried to blockchain-ify supply chains and put tomatoes or bananas or whatever on the blockchain through a shipping blockchain called TradeLens (whatever that means). TradeLens failed and shut down two weeks ago after almost five years of trying. It failed because it didn’t reach “the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business” because the idea simply isn’t viable.\nI think the killer app for blockchain is decentralized money. Others think it's decentralized governance. These ideas come to life as unbanked women in Afghanistan seek financial freedom through Bitcoin and as crowdfunding efforts are organized to bid on things like the U.S. Constitution (a sillier example comparatively, sure, but pretty timely). The killer blockchain apps will most probably (and currently do) live on public, permissionless blockchains.\nAll said, I can assure you of one thing: The killer app won’t come from private, permissioned blockchains used to settle bond placements by huge, multinational investment banks.",

According to the filings, Blumer bought 2,934,537 shares of the crypto bank on Nov. 16 while Block.One bought 2,363,186 shares.\nThe purchase makes Blumer the largest shareholder of Silvergate, according to the latest statistics from FactSet.\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nBlock.one is a private blockchain company founded by Brenden Blumer and Dan Larimer in 2017. It is best known for developing the EOS.IO protocol, which the company announced in 2017 and subsequently released as open-source software in 2018.\nIn a press release, Block.one said it believed Silvergate was a consistent innovator whose share price was undervalued.\n\"We believe Silvergate’s current equity prices do not accurately reflect their strong balance sheet, their strategic positioning, or their market-defiant growth trajectory, and therefore offers a unique investment opportunity.

Cité will be partnering with digital assets firm Taurus to issue its tokenized shares as well as manage the smart contract that creates the shares and perform asset servicing of its securities, according to the statement.\nDegen Chain Racks up Millions in Volumes; Latest in Custodia Bank's Legal Battle Against the Fed\nRead more: Switzerland’s Tokenized Securities Law Ushers In New Chapter for Digital Assets\nTokenization, or the digitization of various asset classes, has been a popular trend among financial institutions because it allows traditional finance (TradFi) players to attract more investors by using blockchain technology. “Taurus believes that digitization of private assets and securities is becoming the new standard in the digital asset industry,\" Taurus said in the statement.\nMost recently, investment management firm Hamilton Lane (HLNE) said it will tokenize three of its funds in a partnership with digital asset securities company Securitize, with the aim of making private market investments available to a broader set of investors. The announcement followed a similar move from investment giant KKR, which announced plans in September to tokenize its Health Care Strategic Growth Fund on the Avalanche blockchain.\nTokenization of Cité Gestion’s shares was carried out in accordance with standards established by the Capital Markets and Technology Association (CMTA), a Geneva based not-for-profit organization, the bank said in the statement. “Taurus and the application of the CMTA standards ensure that an adequate risk management framework is at the heart of the process,\" said Christophe Utelli, deputy CEO of Cité Gestion.\nThe tokens were created using the CMTAT, an open-source smart contract published by the CMTA and specifically dedicated to the tokenization of securities, and recorded on Ethereum, the company said.\nTaurus, founded in April 2018, obtained a securities license last year from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to provide investors and banks the ability to trade a number of assets, including tokenized securities.\nThe company has been involved in the tokenization of 15 companies so far, covering equity, private debt, and structured products from firms in Switzerland as well as Europe.\n“It was important for our bank to be among the first to take advantage of the new possibilities offered by Swiss law for the digitalization of securities by tokenizing our own shares,” Utelli said.\nRead more: Digital Assets Firm Taurus to Launch Securities Marketplace After Getting Swiss License",

    "content": "CRV, the governance token of decentralized exchange Curve, has turned volatile amid a surge in the number of coins held at centralized trading platforms.\nThe token dropped 17% to a two-year low of 40 cents early Tuesday before erasing the losses with a V-shaped recovery. At press time, the token had returned to positive territory for the day, changing hands at 53 cents, according to CoinDesk data.\nThe number of CRV held in centralized exchange wallets has increased by 70% to a record 148.9 million this month, with the tally surging by 46% in the past 24 hours alone, according to data tracked by Glassnode.\nIn other words, the number of CRV available for liquidation on centralized exchanges has substantially increased. Investors typically transfer coins from their wallets to exchanges when intending to sell their positions.\nDevelopments in the CRV market are notable, as Curve, which specializes in stablecoin swaps, is the biggest source of liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi). That means any issue at Curve can have broader market implications.\nCRV's exchange balance has surged amid reports of a large investor transferring large number of borrowed tokens to centralized exchanges.\nAccording to several Twitter-based researchers, including Lookonchain, the investor recently borrowed 20 million CRV from the DeFi lending giant Aave and transferred half of that to OKEx, possibly to sell the cryptocurrency. The balance held on OKEx has increased by 11.3 million this month, according to Glassnode data.\nThe latest edition of the Curve newsletter has referred to the activity as a \"big short\".\nCRV's near-term prospects appear to be bleak as the uptick in the exchange's balance is accompanied by a lack of incentive to hold the token or provide liquidity on Curve.\n\"While Curve was initially a winner after FTX, a lack of user engagement will now hurt them in the short term,\" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said, referring to the collapse this month of crypto exchange FTX. \"There is less interest from users to provide their tokens into liquidity pools and even lock them up in terms of total value locked.\"\n\"Genesis and DCG are adding to the risk of a fire sale for individual tokens,\" Thielen added, referring to Genesis Global Trading and its parent, Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk. Genesis is facing liquidity issues.\nCurve saw massive outflows between Nov. 8 and Nov. 13 as FTX went bust, injecting volatility and uncertainty into markets.

    "summary": "In the four-day tech trade show, companies from across sectors flocked to Las Vegas to showcase their latest innovations. Several brands introduced new metaverse technology, hinting at trends to watch out for in the coming year.",
    "content": "What is the metaverse? Well, it depends on whom you ask, as the loose term referring to a future immersive virtual world continues to morph across industries. Will it be a social platform? Will virtual reality (VR) headsets be the gateway to entry? Will it blur the line between reality and technology?\nAt this year’s massive four-day Consumer Electronics Show (CES), it was clear that both Web2- and Web3-native companies have different views on the path forward.\nThe term “metaverse” was first coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash,” though the development of technologies to enhance the metaverse experience has expanded rapidly in recent years. Mainstream companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) have shifted their focus to innovating in the sector and countries such as Japan have laid out plans to integrate metaverse technology at a national level. Platforms, like The Sandbox, Spatial and Decentraland have sprung up to offer virtual social experiences, though a fully immersive, interconnected metaverse does not yet exist.\nBlockchain technology is being used as a tool to propel the metaverse forward, and the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center was filled with new technologies familiar to the Web3 world. From metaverse company Ixana’s haptic VR technology to Samsung and LG’s smart televisions with blockchain integrations such as non-fungible token (NFT) wallets and marketplaces, CES offered a glimpse into a fantastical decentralized future.\nBut some Web3 builders say that the metaverse isn’t going to arrive as the result of a major technological breakthrough – instead, it will find a way to seamlessly integrate into everyday life.\n“Bridging the digital and physical in an unremarkable, everyday kind of way, with unremarkable everyday technology is actually the core [of the metaverse],” said Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer of Journey, a Web3 consultancy company, on a panel at CES.\nWeb2 brands create meaningful experiences\nWhether it was the Metaverse Fashion Week in March, Snapple’s Metaverse Bodega in August or October’s Metaverse Music Festival, many mainstream brands took their first steps into Web3 this past year. However, some critics have been quick to label these activations as simply a “PR stunt.”\nJustin Hochberg, CEO and founder of metaverse agency Virtual Brand Group, told CoinDesk that brands have reason to explore the metaverse beyond producing a one-time activation – they can deepen relationships with consumers, expand into new markets and avoid challenges associated with the physical world.\n“The laws of gravity don't apply and there are no supply chain issues,” Hochberg said. “When we can create a race car as easily as a scarf, it opens up the creative floodgates to what you want your brand to be.”\nHe predicts that as more companies embrace Web3, they will move beyond simple activations and work to create seamless solutions for their consumers.\n“I think you will start to see people creating real solutions to real problems, not just for the sake of technology,” said Hochberg. “Ultimately, the metaverse will be incorporated into people's daily lives much like the internet is or your iPhone is, so you won't even have to think about it.”\nLarge tech companies native to Web2 are also looking to integrate into Web3 and are creating the technologies to do so. From Microsoft's global chief strategy officer of mobility, automotive and transportation Henry Bzeih’s bullish take on the metaverse to LG’s “shoe-case” NFT product, household names are looking to build for the long term.\n“When I see executives speak out about [the metaverse] and talk about their investment in it, it really gives me optimism and hope,” Shira Lazar, founder of independent publication What’s Trending and host of the podcast \"Inside Web3,\" told CoinDesk. “We start to see these real-life applications beyond the numbers we’ve seen on Decentraland and The Sandbox in 2022.”\nRahul Sabnis, executive vice president and chief creative officer at iHeartMedia, said on a panel that the digital media company chose to launch activations in Web2 metaverse spaces that were already popular but it was important to show up in ways that weren’t “one and done.” He believes that brands need to keep fans engaged and he touched on Web3 ways that could be done.\nSabnis imagined fans at “every concert, [they] scan the QR code, it acts as a wallet, NFT drops are there, there's a chance for seat upgrades.” These wallets could sync with where you are in a venue in real time and expand the experience with augmented reality, for example. In the end, whether it’s Web2 or Web3, Sabnis concluded that “entertaining things are the things that matter most in people’s lives.”\nThe future of work\nMany metaverse activations thus far have been focused on entertainment and leisure, and nothing has gotten more attention than video games. While gamification facilitates a smoother adoption from Web2 to Web3, it hasn’t to date proved to be the key to reaching mass adoption.\nA trend at CES was using metaverse technology to enhance productivity and usher in the future of work, paving the way for a new audience to experience Web3.\nDentsu NXT Space, a metaverse initiative in collaboration with Microsoft, LinkedIn and metaverse company HeadOffice.Space, is building a platform for working in the metaverse.\n“People had a hard time imagining use cases that would match their businesses, but now they’ve matured and know how they want to use it,” Marco Carvahlo, CEO of HeadOffice.Space, told CoinDesk. “We see a lot of interest from HR departments all the way to e-commerce.”\nWith a showroom at CES, Dentsu NXT Space debuted some of its technologies to highlight how its platform can bring businesses into Web3.\n“In the first metaverse iterations, you couldn’t do what we’re doing, which is building the metaverse for productivity, so you can take your customers, bring your meetings, your clients, and embed it in your website,” said Carvahlo. “It’s taking it one step further so we can have real productivity in the metaverse.”\nDentsu NXT Space isn’t alone in its efforts to bring work to the metaverse. Japanese company FORUM8 International is looking to build a productivity-oriented metaverse for companies to establish their offices in the metaverse. The company also displayed its tech on the floor, showcasing software that will allow companies to take work online.\n“We’re trying to build something easy to use, integrating communication features – in the office you want to have face-to-face communication, you can enter meetings by entering meeting rooms, [or you] can start voice chat in VR and have a text chat in the office,” said Luc Kuenemann, software engineer at FORUM8 International.\nWhile more brands are stepping into the metaverse, their approaches don’t all look the same. From clunky headsets to bodysuits to immersive computer experiences, much of the technology shaping the metaverse is taking different forms. Kuenemann told CoinDesk that considering these differences will be crucial in figuring out how to unify social experiences.\n“How do you integrate mixed realities – people who want to work in VR, AR or simple 3D experiences?” asked Kuenemann. “How do you get all those people together to work the way they want to work? It’s a big challenge to tackle [in the metaverse].”\nCrypto elements\nWhile the various metaverse showcases at CES incorporated a range of Web2 technologies, the Web3-native brands that showed up to the event made the case for blockchain and cryptocurrency to be an integral part of some of these innovations.\nSandy Carter, senior vice president of Web3 company Unstoppable Domains, told CoinDesk that the company’s technology, such as crypto wallets and blockchain domains, is creating the on-ramps for mainstream metaverse experiences.\n“We’re the gateway into Web3 … and that’s where a lot of people are today. That digital identity piece is one of the first building blocks of the metaverse and Web3,” said Carter.\nDigital identity, in the form of a wallet ID or an Ethereum domain, is one way that Unstoppable is helping users take their identity across decentralized applications and other blockchain-based products. Carter told CoinDesk that “more integrations [of identity] with utility,” are coming up in 2023, and interoperability will be a key component in making the metaverse accessible.\nAlthough the crypto space is largely still dealing with the widespread fallout of FTX’s unraveling, Web3 companies remain optimistic. The Blockchain Association’s inaugural presence at CES was aimed at highlighting how blockchain technology and cryptocurrency can underpin many of the technological trends forecasted for the year ahead.\nRon Hammond, director of government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based crypto advocacy group, told CoinDesk that the current state of the market isn’t stopping innovation in the space, as many companies are still exploring crypto payments, NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n“We’ve gone back to the basics of rebuilding, focusing on the tech and not talking about [crypto] prices as much,” said Hammond. “We desperately need that energy after the fall of FTX.”\nHe also noted that among cryptocurrency products, utility is on the rise, and it’s only going to grow as we enter the new year.\n“Folks in D.C. are clamoring for real-world use cases and it’s all around [CES].”\nThe bet on branding\nWeb3, a buzzword itself, is an ecosystem of similar buzzwords that come with barriers to entry. So as terms like metaverse, blockchain and NFTs make their way into the conversation, some individuals and companies have been eager to distance themselves from the jargon.\nKirthiga Reddy, co-founder and CEO of Web3 marketing agency Virtualness, said on a panel that NFTs shouldn’t be the go-to term for the technology and that it’s actually a reference to metadata. Rather, descriptions that speak to its identity and interoperability offerings are what’s necessary to facilitate adoption.\nAs more brands enter Web3, they’ve attempted to demystify these technologies by calling NFTs “digital collectibles.” Starbucks’ Odyssey loyalty program, Meta’s minting and selling of digital art on the platform, and NFT collective Front of House’s preferential restaurant booking tokens are just a few examples of initiatives that are veering away from the use of “non-fungible token” in favor of language that eases the onboarding process.\n“The terminology has replaced the reality of what’s going on,” said Ted Schilowitz, a futurist at Paramount Global. “For me, I sort of want to pull back on it. I want to talk about the way technology propels innovation forward.”\nA common thread throughout CES was the creation of frictionless experiences that focus on what fans and communities really want. These experiences also need to be delightful – which will prove key to mainstream metaverse adoption.\n“In the metaverse we are all world builders and we all have a chance to build,” Hackl concluded. “At the end of the day it’s about people.”",

Ethereum momentum\nWhen we look back at 2022 in 10 years, the real news wasn’t the idiocy of Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius Network; it was that Ethereum shipped proof-of-stake and continues to be the most ubiquitous layer 1. A series of protocol-level developments has created a vortex of innovation, development, users and capital. In Ethereum we are witnessing the evolution of the substrate of humanity’s social, economic and political operating system.\nIn 2023, Ethereum will continue to be the most widely adopted, widely developed and capital-heavy layer 1 blockchain. The Merge was the greatest event in the industry since Satoshi’s Bitcoin Genesis Block in 2009. More nuanced but equally important developments will launch on Ethereum in 2023, driving greater adoption and capital in a flywheel effect that will situate Ethereum as the leader in the next bull run.\nThe next Ethereum upgrade after the Merge is Shanghai, planned for the second quarter of 2023. Among many upgrades Shanghai will enable withdrawals of ether (ETH) stakes, which have been locked in the deposit contract since staking was enabled in December 2020. The ability to un-stake ETH could increase the amount of staked ETH as stakers, who were uneasy with the idea of locking funds, come on board.\nFollowing the Shanghai upgrade, EIP-4844 is another Ethereum innovation that will further situate Ethereum as the most ubiquitous layer 1. EIP-4844 will enable proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding is proposed as a step along the way to full sharding, and will help layer 2s scale. Danksharding is a sharding design that uses a “merged market fee” in which each shard has different blocks, but shares one block proposer.\nRead more: What Is Sharding?\nEIP-4844 is a proposal to start implementing elements of danksharding as the full danksharding design is still being developed. Though no longer in the Shanghai update, I predict proto-danksharding will be accepted and implemented in 2023, setting the stage for rapid development towards full sharding and maximum Ethereum scalability.\n2. Ethereum staking\nAfter a smooth transition to proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s utility as a platform for staking innovation will continue to expand, creating a new compounding crypto yield curve.\nFollowing Ethereum’s successful migration to proof-of-stake in September, ETH is now the largest staked capital base of any blockchain, with more than $20 billion staked. Prior to the Merge, we saw innovation in the realm of staking through projects like Lido, which enables liquid staking, and Obol, which provides distributed validator technology.\nIn 2023, we will see continued innovation in ETH staking as capital seeks more secure forms of yield and future updates enable stake withdrawals. EigenLayer is a particularly innovative staking project. EigenLayer provides crypto-economic “security as a service” to rollups, bridges and oracles. EigenLayer allows these projects to leverage Ethereum’s staked security to supplement or complement the security provided by a native token. In 2023, EigenLayer plans to launch its re-staking protocol and the first middleware using the re-staking mechanism, called EigenDA (Data Availability).\nAn increase in ETH staking in 2023 will engender demand for more nuanced utility from validators, stakers, and projects built on Ethereum. Staking innovations like EigenLayer and others will continue funneling utility and capital into the Ethereum base layer, creating a flywheel of adoption and utility that will continue to establish Ethereum as the global settlement layer for Web3.\n3. Fed outlook\nThe Fed will turn dovish, setting the stage for the next crypto bull market in Q3 2023.\nI predict the U.S. Federal Reserve will pivot away from its hawkish policy and stop raising interest rates by the second quarter of 2023. As we see credit card debt at notable highs and savings at notable lows, I anticipate we will see macroeconomic indicators like Brent crude oil fall to $60 – early 2021 levels – and shipping container rates fall below $2,000, which hasn’t happened since before COVID-19. Both of these signals indicate an economy in need of jump-starting, which will convince the Fed to ease off the interest rate hikes. This will engender a risk-on environment, incentivizing capital flows into more innovative industries like crypto. By this time, I also predict sufficient regulatory progress will be made in the crypto industry, meaning that the risk-on environment will be accompanied by clearer policies. Altogether, this will engender the next bull run beginning in Q3 2023.\n4. Regulations in D.C.\nWashington, D.C., will be a crypto hotspot in 2023 as regulatory innovation proceeds at unprecedented rates.\nThe centralized finance disasters of 2022 were the result of poor risk management, insufficient governance, incomplete audits, and potential fraud – all of which could have happened in any industry. Consumer protection will be top of mind for policymakers in 2023. The majority of emerging policy will be around centralized exchanges and stablecoins. Exchanges like Coinbase may be forced to be G-SIFI-regulated institutions, which will increase their regulatory compliance costs. Washington, D.C., will be the hotbed of some of the most controversial and important conversations about crypto in 2023.\nDuring this increase in regulatory attention, the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to declare that all tokens are unregistered securities, which is categorically untrue. Just because this new database technology is able to digitize and tokenize any asset doesn’t mean all such assets are securities. We will see tokens representing everything: an electron on a microgrid, a bar of gold, a carbon offset credit, a software license, a governance right, a concert ticket, a doctor’s prescription, a meme that got very popular in 2010 and then everyone forgot, a fiat currency, and a reward point – none of which should rationally be lumped under securities. That isn’t consumer protection, [SEC chief] Gary Gensler, it’s willful ignorance of new technologies.\nIf the U.S. rushes through poorly designed legislation under the guise of consumer protection, we will lose Web3 to the rest of the world – unlike how the U.S. won the Web2 revolution. A regulatory ontology should be defined to help everyone in the space determine whether a specific token should be classified as a commodity, security, or other type of asset.\n5. Chartered banks\nBanks chartered by the Federal Reserve will offer crypto services.\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council aims to further evolve regulations to protect consumers and enable greater technology innovation in an effort to build more robust and secure global platforms.\nAn example of this is VaultLink, whose Digital Value Transfer Rail enables banks to offer crypto-asset services (custody, staking, exchange), digital value transfers and real-time payments in a regulatory-compliant manner with true supervisory oversight. VaultLink’s 2023 plans are to continue serving as a leading voice on the Federal Reserve’s Working Group while collaborating with the banking agencies to enable crypto services.\n6. More NFT utility\nNFT utility will grow more nuanced, personalized and commercial as we collectively move past the “jpeg” era. At the same time, blue chip “jpeg” NFTs will be a multi-billion-dollar asset class.\nIn 2023, the Web3 ecosystem will move past the “jpeg” era of non-fungible tokens that dominated the last two years, represented by 10,000 pfp projects and zero-utility art. The term “NFT” will no longer automatically mean “digital art” as it has, since a variety of use cases will emerge, all using NFTs as the base technology.\nAlready commercial behemoths like Starbucks are exploring alternative use cases of NFTs. Many more commercial leaders are watching how Starbucks will unfold; if successful, we will see a big bang of major brands releasing NFT rewards points. Web3-native projects such as Mojito have started this evolution, and are already powering both brands and creators that want to explore more personalized utility of NFTs. 2023 will also be the rise of “phygital” where a teenager who purchases a physical pair of Nikes will also have a digital receipt of those sneakers to be digitally worn on their avatar in the metaverse.\nThis rapid evolution in the true utility of NFTs will force the crypto community to look back critically on the projects of 2021 and 2022. If they haven’t failed already, the vast majority of remaining NFT projects that haven’t evolved utility will join the NFT graveyard. What we’ll find remaining will be the blue chip NFTs that have been acknowledged but largely ignored in the last year – the CryptoPunks of the world.\n7. Investment DAOs\nInvestment DAOs will grow in prominence as decentralized, secure and transparent alternatives to investing through GP/LP venture structures.\nInvestment decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) will grow in number and in prominence as transparent, auditable, and collaborative vehicles to deploy and allocate capital. Investment DAOs will force a shift in the mindset of financial decision making; instead of relying on the opinions of a few experts, these DAOs will operate based on the consensus of their global memberships via a “wisdom of the curated crowd.” As agile, on-chain entities, these investment DAOs will be some of the earliest players in high-potential investment opportunities, leveling the playing field for the average investor.\nTribute Labs is an investment DAO building machine whose current network consists of 16 investment DAOs ranging across the Web3 landscape with assets under management of over $1 billion. These DAOs have set frameworks that will serve as blueprints for the emerging set of investments DAOs in 2023. Each DAO is limited to 99 members, striking a balance between a diversity of members and the relative ability to make quick decisions and allocate capital efficiently. Tribute Labs will introduce more DAOs in 2023 (AI, DeSci, Urbit and more), continuing to establish best practices and grow the impact of investment DAOs.\nRead more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect\n8. Filecoin future\nFilecoin becomes a fully fledged layer 1 protocol in its own right, paving the way for the world’s largest decentralized data economy.\nIn 2020, I predicted that IPFS and Filecoin would step into the global spotlight as a viable decentralized solution for data storage. Two years on, the Filecoin network has indeed expanded at breakneck pace, amassing an incredible amount of hardware to the network. It is now the largest decentralized storage network on Earth. More than 4,000 storage providers contribute ~16 exbibyte (EIB) of storage capacity. Client data stored on the network is up 15 times, year to date. That’s enough to store the entire Internet Archive 275 times over. That said, to be competitive with the centralized cloud, Filecoin will need to grow more than 10 times from here – still a long way to go, but a credible path.\nThe vision for Filecoin has always been larger than storage. The project’s community has a steadfast commitment to the mammoth ambition of building the decentralized infrastructure required to enable programmable storage (via smart contracts), retrieval and large scale computation of data. In other words, Filecoin is enabling open services for data.\nThe protocol is releasing smart contracts in Q1 2023 through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a critical on-chain upgrade which will allow it to come into its own as a fully fledged layer 1 protocol. The FVM will enhance the sophistication of Filecoin’s storage services while unlocking a whole new universe of use cases for the Web3 space. To date, other layer 1 smart contracts have focused on a few use cases: decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming and so on. What makes smart contracts on Filecoin unique is the ability to pair these Web3 offerings with real world services like storage and compute, provided by an open market. I expect the Web3 space to eagerly anticipate the “coming of age” of Filecoin and explore building natively on the protocol next year.\n9. Web3 reputation\nReputation will re-emerge as a fundamental innovation in Web3 as a multitude of reputation projects launch.\nIn 2023, years of progress on the decentralized identity and reputation front will finally come to a head. These systems will start to become critical pieces of infrastructure underpinning most of our interactions and transactions, especially in Web3. Soon you will be able to take your flawless reputation built on one application and apply it towards another. Decentralized identity and reputation systems make this possible by taking a more holistic approach to identity through platform-agnostic, user-centric data aggregation.\nProjects like Intuition are pushing the boundaries on the identity front – by incentivizing the attestation of interesting data points and incorporating these attestations into the “identity” derivation processes, Intuition is able to provide a more comprehensive view of “who” and “what” things are. This is essential in enabling humans to coordinate on a decentralized global scale.\n10. ZK everything\nPrepare for the rise of “ZK everything” as privacy technology emerges from academic proofs-of-concept to usable, scalable technology.\nZero-knowledge proofs rose to prominence in the past year, with one use case, ZK-Rollups, gaining visibility as the dominant tool for Ethereum scaling. In 2023, a much broader set of use cases will be unlocked by adoption of software development kits (SDK) that allow ZK smart contracts to be programmed into applications (“ZKApps”), executed off-chain, with verification and settlement back on-chain. Off-chain execution opens up a whole new world for data privacy and attestation, and efficiency. It will start to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, and will enable new identity use cases, social networking, voting, games and zkML.\nThe lynchpin to the success of ZK in 2023 is access to existing Web3 devs. O(1) Labs – company behind the first succinct ZK-based layer 1 MINA – launched an SDK that will better enable the development of in-browser ZKApps in the year to come. These sorts of developments from 2022 will mean that in 2023 ZK will move from the world of academia and testnets into daily Web3 life. Moreover, teams like Matter Labs will roll out zkSync2.0 which is a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine that supports Solidity, Vyper and account abstraction.\nThe zero-knowledge proving market will be larger than bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) market by 2030.\n11. Cosmic Cosmos\nCosmos gets interesting as developers and users seek more customization. Appchains will also go live on Ethereum.\nIn 2023, the “Cosmos vision” will finally find mass adoption. Cosmos is not a blockchain but a ‘“galaxy” of interconnected chains. Importantly, all of the chains employ the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) standard, a technology designed to mimic the early innovations of TCP/IP layer in Web2. For nefarious hackers, bridges have represented the most lucrative attack vector, totaling a whopping US$2.5 billion since 2020. Having a standard communication layer just makes sense.\nMoreover, as blockchains have matured in application, developers will be forced to welcome and own more of the blockchain stack. We will see a range of customizations. How much security does your chain want or need? Is it open for all developers? How about fees? Where do you want to be connected? The many chains approach makes these customizations possible and may unlock true product market fit.\nAppchains give developers the ability to customize execution environments in a way that smart contract platforms can’t support. The challenge is that appchains lose the shared security enjoyed by dapps. App-specific rollups (RollApps) get the best of both worlds and will be a big trend in 2023.\nAlongside the growth in Cosmos, however, we will see the rise of app-specific chains anchored by Ethereum. As the largest project in the blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum is able to take the best in open-source, and port it to the Ethereum community.\nProjects like Stackr Network are pioneering this wave of appchains through RollApps. Stackr offers a language-agnostic SDK for developers to customize optimistic rollups along with a decentralized sequencer network to run them in a trust-minimized way. The plan in 2023 is to build a developer alpha and onboard early projects. These projects will also help shape the design of the system through a closed feedback cycle.\n12. Bitcoin slides\nBitcoin will face headwinds, continue to lose market share and will not lead the next bull market.\nBitcoin will continue falling behind in the market as it succumbs to prevailing headwinds: primarily “pet rock” syndrome, environmental concerns and failure as “digital gold.”\nBitcoin’s lack of daily utility will begin working against its favor as the rest of Web3 starts demonstrating real-world use cases. It will succumb to the “pet rock” syndrome, in which holding the asset won’t seem as attractive compared to directing capital to tokens and ecosystems with increasing commercial and enterprise use.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns will only rise with the macro-political and macro-environmental movement. Enterprises, individuals and governments will be under continued pressure to curb unnecessary energy consumption, and crypto is already under scrutiny. Environmental concerns are only one reason why Web3 prefers proof-of-stake, but it is a coincidence that will make PoS blockchains more resilient against ESG criticisms and regulation. Any remaining PoW chains must demonstrate clear utility to validate continued energy consumption. Bitcoin won’t transition to PoS and its utility will remain limited, setting it up to be the primary recipient of such criticism.\nLastly, bitcoin had every chance to act as a risk-off digital gold-like hedge but failed to live up to that opportunity over several years. It acted like risk-on tech beta instead.\nTogether, these three headwinds will put Bitcoin back even further in this bear market, setting the stage for another layer 1 with actual utility to lead the next bull run.\n13. Web3 gaming\nWeb3 gaming will move past its flawed, early projects and finally begin meeting gamers where they are.\nWeb3 gaming has, for the most part, fallen short of its vision so far. The most “successful” Web3 games – for instance, Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms – have been propped up as the future of gaming, but have failed to make an impression among the 3 billion gamers worldwide. In fact, Web3 gaming has received a bad reputation, characterized as little more than a money grab or DeFi with a veneer. This reputation has not been improved because Web3 gaming projects are highly connected to crypto markets.\nIn 2023, Web3 gaming will shake off the habits of these earliest projects and start releasing projects that bring together the utility of Web3 and the aesthetics of traditional gaming. The next wave of Web3 games will look nothing like the Axie-style games of the last two years, and will begin resembling mainstream gaming aesthetics. Popular attention will shift away from token-first projects like Axie towards the studios, companies, and titles that have been building with a gameplay-first approach: Horizon, Animoca and others.\n14. Layer 2\nAs layer 1 protocols continue to undergo core developments in scalability and privacy, layer 2s will support the next wave of consumer-friendly applications.\nDespite breakneck innovation, the leading layer 1s still have sufficient protocol-layer development to undergo in order to support daily mass adoption of Web3 applications. Specifically, consumer requirements like scale, user experience (UX), confidentiality and security. The layer 2 ecosystem has been growing steadily over the past 18 months, with generalized networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism, and industry-specific networks including ImmutableX. The layer 2 ecosystem has had a couple of false starts but in 2023 we will see layer 2s come to the forefront of crypto adoption as they handle the wave of consumer applications coming to market. In particular, the nonfinancial applications like social media, gaming, and metaverses – which can reasonably prioritize scale over all else – will look towards layer 2s as the best solution to quickly launch in the market.\nRead more: Crypto 2023 – Full coverage\n15. DeSci\nDecentralized science (DeSci) will take center stage as another major use case of Web3, open-source collaboration and decentralized fundraising. DAOs will be at the forefront of the movement.\nIn 2023, DeSci will turn scientific research into a Web3-native asset class through IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property NFTs), ushering a new age of scientific discovery comparable to the enormous breakthroughs witnessed in open source software development in the early 2000s. Fields like biotech will move from monopolistic innovation models to open-source, hyper-collaborative ecosystems where outcomes are more fundamentally aligned with patients and researchers.\nIn 2022, organizations such as Molecule have brought IP from leading universities across the globe on-chain, financed and supported by novel decentralized biotech organizations, such as VitaDAO. VitaDAO is a BioDAO on Ethereum building a portfolio of longevity assets and working to bring these technologies to market in a community-driven way, like a FlamingoDAO for biotech. BioDAOs are communities that fund and incubate IP-NFTs, and are already seeing traction, with four new entities participating in a new accelerator program, bio.xyz.\n2023 will continue the rise of BioDAOs and IP-NFTs, as Fortune 500 organizations like Pfizer expand to cover more scientific fields and therapeutic areas.\n16. Zombie chains\nThe remaining vaporware blockchains will finally lose their positions as “top” blockchains as even speculative money leaves their ecosystems.\nFor years, vaporware blockchains like EOS and Cardano have remained among the “top” blockchains as measured by market cap (Cardano is in the top 10, EOS is in the top 40). These projects are still riding off of hype from their earliest days, having undergone almost no ecosystem development despite the breakneck innovation happening across the rest of Web3.\nIn the current depth of the bear market, Ethereum is maintaining (roughly) $1 billion in volume every 24 hours. Compare that to Cardano’s ~$1M and EOS’ ~$100,000 daily volume. The bear market hasn’t been kind to any network, but EOS has the unique standing of being responsible for the greatest value destruction based on original fundraising against current value, at $4.2 billion lost. Neither chain is living up to the promises made to early consumers. In 2023, even pre-initial coin offering institutional investors and the earliest retail investors will lose interest. The death knell will toll for these vaporware blockchains as they finally lose the last remaining mainstream supporters under the undeniable lack of on-chain adoption.\n17. Decentralized identity\nThe growth in reputation projects, social networks, and decentralized identity will bring AML/KYC solutions down to the wallet level.\nIn 2022, a number of tools emerged that explored the ideas of social networks, reputation, and decentralized identities. These projects included soulbound tokens, ENS, POAPs and Lens. This focus on reputation and identity will increase in 2023, alongside increased regulation and consumer protection for DeFi use (at least in the U.S.). Verifiable credentials will become the data standard for off-chain credentials and attestations, with a focus on free, cheap, and privacy-first options that can be selectively disclosed by users. Where will these solutions come to head? We will see the first iteration of scalable reputation systems built using tools such as MetaMask Snaps, DIDs and VCs.\n18. The crypto contagion isn’t over\nPrepare for more fallout.\nThe turmoil we’ve seen in crypto since May 2022 isn’t over. There are still buried bodies to be found from the excesses and impulses of the past years. Many people and companies have succeeded in obfuscating their exposure, but won’t be able to do so for much longer. Ultimately good for the ecosystem, this will unfortunately mean more consumer money will be lost, more trust betrayed and greater outside criticism. Keep building for the future, but prepare for more fallout in the near term.\n19. Open-source development\nIn 2023, renewed attention will be paid to leading open-source development projects as a hedge against repeating past mistakes in crypto.\n2022 was a massively formative year for open-source, internet-native organizations. The breadth and scale of problems that the Web3 community chose to tackle using these new models grew by an order of magnitude, and the impact these organizations can make for everyday people is starting to become a major theme.\nAs we’ve learned from cases like FTX, it’s far too easy for us to slip back into old habits and accidentally reinvent the same broken systems that centralize power rather than push it to the edges. In 2023, we’ll see more projects come to the conclusion that we need to take our own rhetoric seriously and start to make meaningful strides towards building open-source, community owned infrastructure; towards a world where digital public goods for any local online community can be provisioned in a mutualist way that strengthens trust rather than diminishing it or abstracting it. Two projects in particular will continue to define models of open-source funding and development: Gitcoin and Tea.xyz.\nGitcoin – which has distributed over $72 million in grants – is launching a “grants suite” that will enable any group to seamlessly empower their community members to coordinate funding for projects that address their shared needs. The suite will consist of Passport – a zero-knowledge identity verification tool – and two new protocols: a funding allocation protocol and project registry protocol.\nTea is a protocol that allows open-source developers to be remunerated for their contributions. Tea’s product suite includes a virtual environment manager, a universal interpreter, and a unified dependency manager. In the first month of launching its command-line interface, over 2,400 developers have starred in Tea's GitHub repository, making Tea’s community of over 16,000 developers one of the most rapidly growing groups on GitHub. In 2023, Tea will be building out its blockchain registry, license management and remuneration features.\n20. No more gods\nThe media will abandon its search for gods and find rational voices in crypto.\nAs major centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi projects collapsed in the last year, so too did their founders and CEOs. These individuals had been ravenously propped up by the media, engendering misplaced trust by investors, companies and regulators. The media will need to face its misguided obsession with their crypto “gods” and seek out measured, rational voices in crypto. This will happen, slowly but surely, throughout 2023 as the true nature of more “gods” are revealed.\nFortunately, these rational folks won’t be hard to find for those genuinely interested in reporting on the reality of crypto. These new and old voices – notably humbler than the ones of the last two years – are building for the long term, and should be at the forefront of how the media reports on the space.\n21. Tech crypto\n“Tech crypto” will become useful, replacing “money crypto” and setting the stage for the next bull market.\nIn Bill Hughes’ November CoinDesk op-ed, he explains the difference between “tech crypto” and “money crypto.” Tech crypto is about “peer-to-peer computer networks where participants transact by interacting with globally accessible software.” Money crypto is about “buying, holding, lending and trading tokens as investable assets.”\nThe past year has been dominated by money crypto in terms of popular adoption, regulatory attention, and consumer knowledge. Centralized exchanges have been the “beating heart” of money crypto, and the landscape of CeFi now has a microscope on it from regulators. The scrutinization of money crypto will result in the clarification of tech crypto as a related, but separate, field.\nTech crypto in 2023 will become more and more useful through two trends: 1) the movement of capital from centralized to decentralized financial applications and 2) the rise of non-financial decentralized applications like DeSci, social media, consumer rewards and more. The result will be a growing foundation of Web3 (i.e., tech crypto) adoption rather than just token (i.e., money crypto) adoption. This will set the stage for the next bull market and help hedge against volatile market cycles in the future as more capital is kept in transparent financial applications rather than shadowy centralized alternatives.\n22. Enterprise ethereum\nThe “Great Decoupling” will accelerate, paving the way for stronger enterprise adoption of Ethereum.\nIn 2023, we will see the “Great Decoupling” and the consequent acceleration of enterprise adoption of Ethereum. As explained by Paul Brody, the Great Decoupling is when “the value proposition of Ethereum as a computing platform for enterprises finally gets separated from the focus on the price of Ethereum and financial speculation.” The focus on Ethereum’s enterprise utility will unlock greater enterprise innovation, spearheaded by organizations like EY building privacy technology on Ethereum. EY (Ernst & Young) now has industrial privacy solutions that support complex business logic, payments and transfers that run on public Ethereum. In the coming year, while enterprises can expect to see demand for audit and risk management go up, they can also expect to see growth in supply chain, procurement, and carbon traceability applications.\n23. DeFi is different\nThe world will understand the difference between CeFi and DeFi.\nThe only creditors made whole during the disasters of 2022 were Ethereum-based smart contracts, like those on Aave, where Celsius and Alameda Research repaid their loans to access collateral they posted to borrow dollars. Smart contracts didn’t need to retain Kirkland & Ellis or John Ray III for their reorganization, there was no negotiation and the technology worked transparently without fail as intended. The macro consequence of all this for 2023 will be a greater understanding – by individuals, financial institutions, investors, and regulators – of the difference between CeFi and DeFi. The former is where transactions are subjectively intermediated by humans who are able to improperly tamper with the database. The latter are where transactions are trustlessly and objectively intermediated by math and computer science without manipulation.",

    "content": "Adelle Nazarian of the American Blockchain PAC and Alex Allaire of the American Blockchain Initiative recently provided, in The National Interest’s Techland section, 10 substantive legislative proposals for the responsible development of digital assets.\nThe fourth of these, keeping in mind that fraud and the misappropriation of federal disaster relief funds are all too common, states that we would benefit greatly from creating a proof-of-stake blockchain platform to distribute federal disaster relief funds.\nTodd White is the founder of, and Ralph Benko senior counselor to, the American Blockchain PAC.\nHow much would the blockchain save us taxpayers? “Billions and billions!” (H/t, Carl Sagan.)\nThe Washington Post has reported the U.S. Justice Department estimates more than $8 billion in alleged fraud just in the federal government’s coronavirus relief programs, bolstering companies that did not actually exist or wholesale identity theft by transnational crime syndicates to file for fraudulent unemployment benefits.\nThe problem is almost certainly worse. The Washington Post, again, reported the $6 trillion in loans, grants, checks and emergency assistance created “a unique and lasting strain” on ensuring the funds had been put to good use. And that “the money remains hard to track.”\nSee also: Blockchain Means So Much More Than Crypto | Opinion\nThe real culprit? The federal government’s archaic financial infrastructure.\nMost of us by now know that many roads and bridges, much of the electric grid, water and wastewater systems are dilapidated. Less well known? Many of our public financial systems are antiquated, too.\nBlockchain-based enterprise platforms can be programmed to restrict disbursements to legitimate purposes, producing a tamperproof, easily audited record. Why hasn’t this been already adopted? Consider Sir Arthur C. Clarke’s Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”\nOne of us worked in the U.S. Department of Energy back in the mid-1980s and observed the procurement of the agency’s first desktop computers. It felt somewhat like the scene in the 1951 movie, “The Day The Earth Stood Still” that depicted the trepidation of the Earthling civilians and soldiers surrounding the flying saucer that landed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Klaatu barada nikto!\nBack during tech’s Cretaceous Period, a speechwriter to President Ronald Reagan told the story of when the president’s staff rolled an early PC into the Oval Office primed to send the first presidential email. The White House had put red (fittingly!) tape around the Enter button to show the president where to press Send.\nReagan turned to them and said presidential predecessor “Jimmy Carter told me not to push any red buttons!” Reagan, understandably, declined to press.\nThe pace of the federal government is reminiscent of that old “Speed Bump” cartoon of a wrinkled old snail telling a group of astonished young snails: “Then suddenly… whoosh! The glacier came out of nowhere and overtook all but the speediest of your ancestors ...!”\nHilarious. But the joke’s on us.\nOur financial infrastructure is not designed to distribute billions, even trillions, of dollars of relief funds both fast and well. There is evidence that substantial bleed-out occurs for all federal emergency disbursements. It’s reportedly worse for foreign aid.\nSee also: Bitcoin Is the Song That Does Not End | Opinion\nDisbursements are right in the blockchain’s sweet spot. While it would not yet be a simple “off-the-shelf” purchase, a fraction of the lost $8 billion (or much more) devoted to R&D by such agencies as DARPA, NSF, NIST, the National Labs, NASA and other teched-up agencies and procurements at scale by the Department of Defense, General Services Administration and others would surely conjure the magic of the free market to produce a great, scalable blockchain platform.\nThe return on investment for the taxpayers and America? Immense.\nThat’s what happened with computer chips. NASA’s big purchases of semiconductor chips drove the industry’s costs dramatically down. Chips became so cheap they replaced vacuum tubes and printed circuits in everything from radios and TVs to computers, automobiles, airplanes and, well, just about everything.\nHow immense? Consider that today’s iPhone would have cost over $101 million to build in the year 1991.

    "content": "Nearly two years after one of the biggest short squeezes in market history, some lessons have been learned and others less so, possibly because investors are struggling to keep up with what has become a relentless and punishing stream of macro and market news.\nThe GameStop saga of 2021 has now been cataloged in two separate documentaries – aptly named “Eat the Rich” and “Diamond Hands” – which make for compelling TV. The story illustrates the cumulative risks of powerful market players acting as gatekeepers while having little interest in protecting both individual and public interests.\nFrederik Gregaard is the CEO of the Cardano Foundation.\nThe cycle of euphoria and crash that Gamestop epitomized has since played out, to even more devastating effect in the crypto arena. Hundreds of thousands of retail investors were left holding drastically devalued tokens thanks to the mismanagement of high profile investment funds and brokerages. In addition, crypto evangelists with vested interests in the inflated price of these assets and who zealously overhyped them must assume their share of the blame.\nMy own journey into blockchain started out of frustration. Why weren’t the benefits available to “accredited investors” also available to ordinary citizens? In answering this question, I saw an amazing opportunity to democratize finance through decentralization, empowering individuals to do more with their economic assets and to improve society as they did so.\nWhile I firmly believe in the potential of blockchain, as long as we use the same breath to talk about crypto and meme stocks we are falling far short of that potential.\nThe true financial potential of blockchain is not as a new set of speculative assets, but as a vehicle for radical transparency, giving power to identity and new forms of governance. Not to mention the efficiency of the technology itself, which can reduce market distortions and volatility, even as it lowers costs and speeds up transaction times.\nSee also: Blockchain Means So Much More Than Crypto | Opinion\nIn short, the blockchain mission should not be about promoting specific tokens or taking down Wall Street but about leveling up our entire global financial system.\nAs we watch liquidity drain from financial reserves at frightening speed, it is critical that we refocus on this mission. We must set our sights on transforming, rather than merely trashing, the titans of Wall Street.\nAt the Cardano Foundation, we are committed to two difficult things: genuine engagement on the complex problem of how to educate, engage and drive adoption of blockchain technology among traditional enterprises; and active commitment to the principles of decentralization and community best exemplified by the open source software movement.\nI believe that addressing any of these two tasks properly helps to solve the other, and that we should prioritize both simultaneously. Just as the transparency embedded in open source software means it is now trusted by blue chip companies to run their most crucial platforms, the openness and legibility of blockchain done right can help to make financial empowerment and disintermediation more than just meme stock buzzwords.\nThird-generation blockchain protocols are more sophisticated and more resilient than the creaking technology on which much of our financial system still runs. But no matter how good our tech and how committed our community is, replacing the legacy technology of incumbent banks becomes an even more daunting task than trying to take down hedge funds over-exposed to a single stock. It demands not only revolutionary spirit but also regulatory awareness.\nRead more: The Crypto Revolution's 'Turning Point' | Opinion\nThe innovation and transformation that our technologies can bring is continuing at tremendous speed, and policymakers have taken notice. In Europe, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) will soon go into effect, creating a legal framework for the functioning of crypto-assets markets. Across the Atlantic Ocean, in the U.S., the Biden administration is working to develop laws that spur growth and inhibit fraud.\nThis increased regulatory activity signals that blockchain technologies are here for the long haul. Right now, lawmakers need to ensure they future-proof their legislation so that, instead of just responding to possible threats, they can throw open the door for honest and beneficial innovation.\nAs for the industry, it is our job to keep innovating, build more solutions that contribute to society, democratize and simplify finance and enable access and inclusion for everyone. I, for one, am looking forward to what the future holds.",

    "content": "Ethereum layer 2 scaling system Optimism on Wednesday proposed a mainnet upgrade to boost performance and functionality, accelerating the rally in its governance token OP.\n\"The Optimism Foundation is proud to propose the first protocol upgrade to the Optimism Collective: Bedrock,\" the proposal floated in the governance forum said.\n\"This upgrade offers a new level of modularity, simplicity, and Ethereum equivalence for layer 2 solutions, providing unprecedented performance and functionality,\" the proposal added, noting additional benefits that may lead to a Cambrian explosion of layer 2 protocols.\nOP has rallied nearly 25% in the past 24 hours, hitting a new record high of $2.90, CoinDesk data show. The Bedrock proposal seems to have driven the token higher.\nThe community will vote on the proposal after two weeks of discussion. If approved, the upgrade will be implemented on March 15 at 9:00 a.m. PT (17:00 UTC).\nBedrock is a rollup architecture developed by Optimism. Rollups enable batching and publishing hundreds of transactions in a single mainnet block. In other words, they compress many transactions into one, speeding up the blockchain.\nPer Messari's Kunal Goel, the Bedrock upgrade will help Optimism improve transaction fees and speed and create a foundation for future improvements like decentralized sequencing, helping it compete with its main rival, Arbitrum. \"OP Labs expects Bedrock will make optimism the cheapest rollup on Ethereum,\" Goel said in a research note last month.\nWeb3 research and development firm Xord's research writer Zainab Hasan expects the Bedrock upgrade to reduce the block time of Optimism in case of pending transactions from 13 seconds to 2 seconds and facilitate faster deposits.\n\"With Bedrock, Optimism will be the first EVM-based rollup to deliver Ethereum-level security guarantees,\" Hasan said in an analysis published in October.\nOP token leads the way\nOptimism's OP token has rallied nearly 200% in the past few weeks, outshining bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) by a big margin. The top two coins have gained 44% and 39%, respectively. Optimism's rival Arbitrum doesn't have its native token yet.\nOptimism has also outpaced in terms of the percentage growth in total value locked in the decentralized finance ecosystem in the past 30 days.\nData from DeFiLlama shows the total value locked (TVL) in Optimism has increased by 47% to $744 million, while that in Arbitrum has gone up by 27% to $1.3 billion.\n\"One of the big narratives of 2023 looks to be Layer 2's and the only way to get direct exposure to them right now is through the OP token,\" Conor Ryder, research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said. \"TVL on Optimism has also outpaced Arbitrum, its closest competitor, to start the year.\"\nThe layer 2 adoption kicked off last year with Arbitrum and Optimism experiencing a steady growth in the user base despite the broader market swoon. Active user participation on Optimism surpassed that on Arbitrum at the end of December.\nIf that's not enough, early today, Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, announced the integration of its dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD and its wrapped version Binance-peg BUSD on Optimism.\nBinance users can now move BUSD and Binance-peg BUSD across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, TRON, Avalanche and Optimism networks.\nThe integration may galvanize more investor interest in Optimism, considering BUSD is the world's third-largest stablecoin by market value. At press time, BUSD has a market cap of over $16 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $12.14 billion.\n\"BUSD is one of the largest stablecoins, and having it on Binance simplifies the user experience for retail and institutional traders without the need for decentralized bridges,\" said pseudonymous DeFi researcher Ignas, speaking to CoinDesk.\n\"Currently, only Ethereum, Polygon, Avax, and Tron are supported. Surprisingly, Arbitrum is not yet supported,\" Ignas added.\nEdit: 13:36 UTC, Feb. 3: Corrects Messari analyst's name to Kunal Goel. The previous version said Kunal Shah.",

    "content": "As Elon Musk's Twitter takeover continues to embattle the social platform, many crypto enthusiasts that initially found a home there are looking for an alternative space to grow their community. Enter Console, a blockchain-based messaging platform that hopes to fix some of the issues that plague other social platforms like spam and misinformation and bring privacy and data ownership centerstage.\nFounded by serial entrepreneurs David Leiberman and Chris Castiglione, the platform opened for beta testing on Thursday, calling itself the \"evolution of group chat\" by integrating Web3 tools that allow for greater collaboration between builders and communities.\n\"Today social platforms are broken,” said Castiglione. “Console puts the power back into the hands of communities. Users control their identity, and communities can leverage this trust to improve coordination and engagement.\"\nSpecifically, the platform addresses issues with other social networks like \"spam, bots, and sock puppets\" by offering features like identity verification through web wallet login and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. In addition, Console offers tools that support voting, threaded messages, events, bounties and treasury to help budding crypto communities scale their efforts.\n\"Web3 transforms the internet into powerful, interconnected and composable Lego, and Console is the base layer for assembling communities,\" said Castiglione.\nAccording to the company, over 400 artists, non-fungible token (NFT) holders, creators and musicians have already been onboarded onto the platform. Trevor Owens, founder of Crash Punks and Console user, described the platform as \"Discord built from the ground up for Web3 communities.\"\nRead more: How to Find Your Community in Web3\nThe open-source platform calls itself \"progressively decentralized, secure-by-design and community-owned.\" The beta launch is the first stage of the ConsoleDAO, the organization behind the platform aimed at \"influencing, contributing to, and sharing in Console’s future growth.\"\n\"We see Web3 as a movement that returns the internet back to its roots – to build apps that return the power back to the people,\" Castiglione said. \"I believe that if we’re going to build a more democratic, free internet, then we need to build it on a foundation of tools that respect those values.\nConsole arrives as the conversation about decentralized social networks continues to grow louder. Though tech titans like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey have touted alternatives, no blockchain-based social network has yet to fully pry users away from centralized legacy platforms.\nSee Also: What Is Zion, the Web5 Social Network App?",

    "summary": "When you break down the promise of blockchain technology as a new form of computing, oracles and shared storage are two strong use cases. This piece is part of CoinDesk’s IDEAS Week.",
    "content": "Bitcoin and its blockchain burst on the scene in 2009. Its mission was decentralized money and a peer-to-peer payment system. But pretty quickly people started to emphasize a different perspective on the Bitcoin project: its role not as a currency but as a new form of computing. Forming circa 2015-2016, these observers (known as Blockchain-Not-Bitcoin) said: “Well, I don’t care about decentralized money and a peer-to-peer payment system, but we’re really excited about the underlying blockchain technology.”\nThis sort of thought process is not unique to Bitcoin or crypto. The internet started as something prosaic (a means for researchers to share information) and has now evolved to shape the highly dynamic world of today.\nBlockchain tech is a foundational shift in computing, allowing investors to get excited about new use cases for technology because with new use cases come new opportunities for financial return. Bitcoin’s success is in computing and digitization.\nThis article is part of CoinDesk's \"I.D.E.A.S. Week.\" Register here to become a part of the Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), a new conference focused on the innovations happening across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse.\nI spent time discussing two use cases with someone smarter than I am: Max Good, senior index research analyst at CoinDesk Indices (CDI). Max is part of the team that developed CoinDesk’s Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), which aims to provide taxonomy with comprehensive and standardized industry definitions and classifications for digital assets.\nLet’s dive in.\nWhat is computing?\nThe computing sector, as defined by CDI, consists of projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing and transmission of data. CDI further breaks down this sector into five industry groups: oracles, shared storage, internet-of-things, private computing and shared network.\nThe types of projects and companies included in these groups dabble in on-chain and off-chain data transmission, social data platforms, peer-to-peer secure data transactions, open networks, free-market private computation, and decentralized file storage and sharing.\nOK, but what do all of these mean? My conversation with Max Good suggested that the two sub-categories in computing with the most to offer at present are oracles and shared storage.\nOracles\nOracles send data from the outside world, like the price of bitcoin or the temperature in Orange County, to a blockchain so specific data can execute the disbursement of money. Right now, the world of on-chain to on-chain oracles is relatively robust. For example, there are price index feeds available via oracle networks powered by Chainlink that feed into futures trading contracts powered by Ethereum. From Good’s perspective, the important thing about these price feeds is the “index’s methodology is replicable, which makes them candidates for easy and transparent auditing.”\nWhen we discussed the “next big thing” in oracles, Good said the next natural step comes from effectively connecting the real world to on-chain by “providing an infrastructure service that facilitates on-chain activities governed by the incorporation of off-chain data.” This is where the so-called oracle problem lies. It is difficult for blockchains, even with oracles, to securely interact with external sources of data.\nRead more: Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment\nFor clarity’s sake, here’s an example where an oracle may or may not help. Let’s imagine a thermometer that feeds into an oracle is put into a refrigerated 18-wheeler carrying perishable food. There is an insurance policy on that perishable food that is built into a smart contract. The insurance policy will cover the financial damage of the spoilage of that perishable food if a) the food is spoiled upon arrival and b) the temperature of the trailer was continually kept below 55 degrees. The insurance policy will automatically pay out if these a) and b) are satisfied.\nProving that a) happened is somewhat difficult but likely trivial for all stakeholders involved with the transport of the food; b) is even more difficult. How can we guarantee that the thermometer functioned properly or otherwise not tampered with? How do we know the oracle was not somehow paid off-chain (or on another chain) to lie about the temperature in the trailer? What’s the point of having a decentralized oracle as the source of truth on what the real-world data says if the real-world data can be manipulated and there’s no way to double-check the data?\nBut there are a lot of projects working on the oracle problem, which you can check out on CoinDesk’s Indices DACS 500 list.\nShared storage\nShared storage refers to the decentralization of storage servers that are, traditionally, owned and operated by a central organization. On its face, the shared storage protocols have a clear investment merit. In the world of cloud storage where big companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft dominate, keeping you or your company’s sensitive information safe from competitors and potential hackers is attractive.\nShared storage platforms, to their credit, aim to increase security of data storage by running on a blockchain network that allows for privacy and pseudonymity of data transmitters. That said, there are two particular places where shared storage projects might run into potential headwinds.\nThe first is simply economies of scale and the cost. It’s really not that expensive to store data with a centralized company when it has literally exabytes of capacity (an exabyte is huge, like 500 billion photos huge), plenty of deployable capital and know-how to store even more data in data centers.\nThe second is reliability, which needs to be achieved without a corporate third party. A corporate third party can be held liable for losing your data. To get around liability, current shared storage crypto projects use schemes such as proof-of-storage to check that the disparate parties storing your data do in fact have that data stored.\nGiven its immense competitive disadvantage, shared storage projects are not as well built-out as oracle projects. Given this, there doesn’t seem to be a short-term opportunity for investors, but there is certainly something attractive about decentralizing the storage of potentially sensitive and confidential data.\nDigitization, digitization, digitization\nThe digitization sector, as defined by CDI, refers to the process by which real-world documents, contracts and the like are uploaded to a blockchain for the purpose of transparency, publicly verifiable ownership and immutability. According to DCI, digitization is currently the smallest sector in the DACS, but it has a wide range of potential use cases like helping brands establish digital identity or establishing ownership of real estate through blockchain-izing deeds to property.\nBlockchain-enabled digitization has already taken root in the realm of digital identity with projects like Ethereum Name Service (ENS). ENS allows users to convert a public Ethereum address into a recognizable identifying name on the blockchain. Be it nike.eth or george.eth, these more digestible (and memorable) addresses, like domain names, have obvious advantages for companies for branding purposes, and for individuals for vanity purposes.\nRead more: Bitcoin and Beyond: The Future of Cryptocurrency Investing\nOf course, any discussion about digitization enabled by crypto will be incomplete without what feels like the oldest use case of them all: Allowing patients to digitize their medical records to enable faster exchange of information without loss of privacy. While this, on paper, sounds like a wonderful use case and implementation of digitization, there are significant headwinds inherent in how health-care information sharing, especially in the United States, is structured.\nIn the U.S., health-care provider billing practices and claims management large payers still rely on fax machines. Further complicating the issue is how the proliferation of electronic health records (EHR) occurred. In 2009, the U.S. Affordable Care Act provided incentives for health-care providers to implement federally approved IT systems. Companies were reeling after the 2008 financial crisis and took advantage of these incentives by swiftly putting together projects that were ultimately implemented in a disjointed manner.\nSure, this has become more cohesive with companies like Cerner, Epic and athenahealth working on the interoperability of these disparate systems. But the short-term issue with the “crypto” digitization of health care remains: The original digitization of health care was done so poorly there isn’t a layer that can be easily migrated from an old, dull non-crypto layer to a new, shiny crypto layer. You’d be better served blowing the system up and starting from scratch.\nSo is there nothing to invest in?\nThere are significant headwinds for the adoption of crypto projects focused on computing and digitization given how large the entrenched parties in the two spaces are. That doesn’t mean all attempts should be abandoned. To be sure, Bitcoin, the payment system, itself is looking for adoption in face of equally large entrenched parties.\nAll said, although these projects face significant headwinds in the short term, there are surely opportunities for the improved privacy, transparency and ownership that crypto promises to improve computing and digitization overall.\nComputing and Digitization is a presentation category at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.\nLearn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners or entities generating the cryptocurrency seem to be running down their coin stash amid the FTX-induced market panic.\nIn the past seven days, the balance held in miner wallets has declined by 9,402 BTC to a ten-month low of 1.826 million BTC ($30.6 billion), according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\nThe miner net position change, or the 30-day change of BTC supply held in miner addresses, slipped to -10,972 BTC on Thursday, the lowest since early January.\nBitcoin miners solve complex algorithmic problems to mine blocks and verify transactions in return for rewards paid in BTC. In other words, the miner profitability is heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency's price. Therefore, miners tend to run down their inventory in a bleeding market to stay afloat.\nBitcoin fell by 22% in the seven days to Nov. 13, its biggest decline since June, as the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange dented investor confidence and triggered contagion fears.\nThe sell-off could continue in the days ahead, analysts told CoinDesk. That would worsen the situation for miners, who have been facing high operational costs.\n\"Bitcoin mining companies have struggled this year, with the fall in the price of the largest cryptocurrency and rising energy prices (and operating costs) leading to a decline in revenue. As a result of this, mining firms have been heavily selling their underlying holdings, leading to significant net outflows over the last six months,\" data provider CryptoCompare said in the October review.\nCharles Edwards, CEO of asset manager Capriole, recently voiced a similar opinion on Twitter, saying, \"bitcoin's electrical cost has just been breached for the 2nd time only in 5 years. The electrical bill for the average miner is now greater than the income earnt.\"\n\"Many Bitcoin miners are now turning their rigs off,\" Edwards added.\nAccording to Blockware Solutions, a continued BTC price slide toward $15,000, would not necessarily see miners immediately turn of their machines.\n\"Many miners have PPAs [power purchase agreements] and hosting contracts that require them to consume energy or potentially pay an additional fee. Many miners will likely continue mining at a loss in the short term until either the price of BTC goes back up, or they exit their operation altogether,\" Blockware's latest weekly newsletter said.",

Sidechains are separate blockchains built on, but running independently of, a main blockchain.\nCardano joins Polkadot in offering the framework, which allows developers to experiment with niche applications in a live environment without compromising the main network. Sidechains can increase the transaction capacity, enabling more data to be processed without increasing the risk of network downtime.\nIOG said its goal with the toolkit is to extend Cardano's capabilities by making it more scalable without compromising the stability or security of the main chain. The toolkit allows for the creation of sidechains, each with its own consensus algorithm, meaning applications built on a sidechain won't depend on Cardano’s network rules to function.\nThe sidechains are connected to the main chain through a bridge that allows asset transfer between the chains.\nCardano’s native ADA token was little changed following IOG’s announcement, rising just 3% in the past 24 hours, in line with the broader crypto market.",

    "content": "“Institutions are coming” is a common mantra for mainstream adoption in crypto. The idea implies a huge flow of capital into the $1 trillion crypto market, and the accelerated maturing of crypto as an asset class.\nBut when institutions come, where do they go and who do they trust?\nMrinal Manohar, the CEO and co-founder of Casper Labs, says he knows what the institutions want. To that end, Casper Labs’ eponymous project, Casper Network, a layer 1 blockchain, already works with blue chip companies like IBM.\nMrinal Manohar is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.\nCasper finished testing and was launched on mainnet in March 2021. The project raised $14.5 million in 2019 from investors including Arrington XRP Capital and Wall Street’s jack-of-all-trades, Terren Scott Peizer.\nBlockchain technology and projects built on that technology rely on two domains of expertise: finance and computer science. Conveniently for Manohar, he has a background in both.\nBefore starting Casper, Manohar was a principal and sector head of technology, media and telecom at Sagard Capital, a hedge fund with a long-only strategy worth about $1 billion. He also previously served as a private equity associate at Bain Capital in Boston, and as an associate consultant at Bain & Company. He has a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.\nUnlike most players in crypto from traditional backgrounds, he’s an early entrant in the space.\nSee also: DIMO Helps Drivers Gain and Monetize Their Car Data\n“I discovered bitcoin in 2010 because my roommate at the time [...] was one of the biggest miners in the world. Bear in mind, this is 2010 – there's no Coinbase. You're writing keys down on paper,” he told CoinDesk. “So he had a rack of servers and he was like 5% of hash power.”\nManohar started buying his first stacks of bitcoin in late 2011 and early 2012 directly from his former roommate from grad school. His other early bets included seed investing in Ethereum, Blockstack, Basis, Maker, Filecoin and several others.\nAlthough peer-to-peer interaction laid the foundations of his origin story in the blockchain space, he soon turned his attention to enterprise.\n“I realized that neither on the structure side nor the product side was a blockchain company or protocol that was really taking care of the needs of enterprise. And that's what led me to found Casper Labs – to be a software developer who helps do that.”\nFor multi-functional blockchains serving the needs of enterprise, innovation is an integral part of the tech stack offering. Casper provides a highly adaptable blockchain environment on which enterprises can operate. Smart contracts aren’t immutable – that is, not immutable in the future, but immutable in the past. And that’s a crucial difference, Manohar explains. Enterprise wants control over their tech infrastructure as things may change in the future – changes may come from regulations, business needs, and new technical developments.\n“Whenever I say this, some people are like, ‘Oh my God, you can't use the words ‘control’ and ‘blockchain’ in the same sentence,’ and I'm like, ‘No, it's not that they want control over the blockchain. The blockchain is completely decentralized. They want control over their application,’” Manohar said.\nThat makes it easier to implement and scale new features on the blockchain. If a company has a market mortgage determined by a smart contract, and the rules of how mortgages are deployed change (as they often do), then the smart contract will also be upgradeable.\nSee also: How One Scientist-Turned-Founder Is Bridging Drug Discovery with Blockchain\nManohar thinks it isn’t just the technical and legal infrastructure of current offerings in the blockchain space that are insufficient for enterprise needs. There’s also a hype-driven culture that dominates the marketing ethos of crypto companies. The incentive structure is kind of broken, too, he explained.\n“Investors get some tokens [with] two [or] three-year vest[ing periods], and then people go away. If the protocol is successful and gets hype, people make a ton of money and they go buy cars. It leads to really bad habits. Enterprises hate associating with people who they think are scammy or hypey or like, too cool for school,” Manohar told CoinDesk.\nThe enterprise sales cycle is very long, he said – nothing like the mayfly-like cycle of most crypto projects – which means you need to build a company that is oriented for the long term. Manohar says he’s certainly in it for the long haul.\nLayer 2\nIDEAS Week",

To smooth out the friction inherent to this endeavor, Stablecorp has sought help from other platforms.\nPresently, the company only works with American-based companies, including peer-to-peer payment company Circle as well as the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation. In April, Stablecorp raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round, which was led by six companies, including Side Door Ventures and Genesis. Stablecorp is worth upwards of $5 million at the moment, said McDougall.\nThe company can be broken down into three parts. The first is the consumer-facing arm of the company, known as Grapes Finance, which launched last week and gives users the option to exchange their fiat currency for USDC or QCAD stablecoins.\nIts second component is yield-as-a-service (YAAS), a tool that allows individuals and firms to borrow and lend data related to digital assets. Its final offering, known as the “Forge,” is a multi-chain software that gives individuals and firms alike the ability to track whether a deposit has been made.\nThe company is also working to bring cross-border capabilities to “spot desk, derivatives trading and currency hedging” while using on-chain assets. In addition, when a user onboards via Grapes Finance, it technically onboards with other counterparties, which can, in turn, grow the services that company offers, as well as their client base.\nAt its simplest level, McDougall said, Stablecorp is trading on models that already exist, but doing so with better risk analytics structures.\nProspective investors should “know that there's a kernel of magic in here, that is the blockchain world,” McDougall said.\nLayer 2\nIDEAS Week",

    "summary": "After teasing Suave at this year’s Devcon, Flashbots outlines how the plug-and-play solution will transform the way validators earn MEV.",
    "content": "Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots released new information Wednesday on “The Single Unifying Auctions for Value Expression” (Suave) – its vision for a new kind of blockchain that would radically transform the process by which chain-operators (i.e., “validators”) earn value across different networks.\nAccording to Flashbots, Suave, a so-called sequencing chain, will be geared towards completely decentralizing the block-building process. By the firm’s description, it would be a “plug-and-play” solution that “unbundles the mempool and block-builder role” from existing blockchains.\nIn addition to maximizing the revenue that validators earn for operating blockchains, Flashbots hopes Suave can ameliorate rising concerns around transaction censorship, exploitative MEV practices and slow transaction execution.\nFlashbots co-founder Philip Daian announced Suave earlier last month in Bogota, Colombia, at Devcon, the biggest Ethereum conference of the year.\nAs part of today’s update, Flashbots announced its first planned milestone will be to share a prototype for its “Execution Market,” where users can submit their transactions, and Suave will run simulations to return as much MEV as possible to validators. Flashbots also plans to release a Suave testnet chain to begin testing its new features.\nThe Flashbots research and development team has been working on ways to curb the potential harms of Maximal Extraction Value (MEV) within the Ethereum ecosystem. MEV refers to the additional income that block builders and validators receive as a result of including or reordering transactions within a block. One of the tools that validators can use to circumvent malicious MEV practice is by using MEV-Boost, a middleware component that Flashbots built, which allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders.\nRight now, the way to earn MEV, mainly through MEV-Boost, has a centralizing effect. Validators connect to MEV-Boost through relayers, like the one that Flashbots runs, to earn MEV. About 91% of blocks relayed have used MEV-Boost; of those, 78% have used the Flashbots relayer. In August, Flashbots’ relayer started censoring Tornado Cash transactions to comply with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, but decided to make open source its MEV-Boost relayer code so that others could develop their own non-censoring relayer options.\nWith Suave, Flashbots hopes to improve the block-building process and further decentralize MEV, allowing validators, users, and third-party “executors” to maximize their revenue, while also maintaining a fair ecosystem.\nRead more: Flashbots Reveals New Version of Its Key Ethereum Software\nHow does Suave work?\nSuave’s aim is to decentralize and democratize block builders around MEV.\nIn today’s blogpost, Flashbots said Suave’s architecture would be set up in three parts.\nThe first part, the “Preference Environment,” will collect “preferences” from users – messages which “express a particular goal or unlock a payment if the user’s conditions have been met.”\nThe second part, the “Execution Market,” will allow third-party “executors” to earn MEV by competing with one another “for the right to turn a preference into a transaction (or bundle) and fulfill the users’ preference at the best price possible.”\nThe final part, the “decentralized block building network,” will turn these transactions into blocks that can be added to a blockchain while maximizing MEV for builders and validators.\nThese three components make up what will be called the Suave Chain. The chain will be EVM-compatible, meaning it will work with blockchains built using Ethereum’s core technology stack.\nRead more: Censored Ethereum Blocks Hit the 51% Threshold Over the Past 24 Hours",

    "summary": "Policymakers and business executives were quick to draw a distinction between distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies at WEF23.",
    "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland — Blockchain, not crypto.\nFrom propping up climate solutions and delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine to moving on from the stunning collapse of FTX, the second day of the World Economic Forum's 2023 annual conference saw discussions very much focused on the promise of the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, rather than the often-speculative financial assets themselves.\nThe day began with a panel from traditional finance players attempting to draw a line under the FTX scandal – to note that, even if it’s a crisis for the cryptocurrency industry, it’s not a crisis for other tools built on distributed ledger technology.\n“It’s important not to conflate cryptocurrencies and CBDCs, stablecoins and DLT …. they’re very different,” said PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman, referring to distributed ledger technology.\nDespite the crypto crash, “the underlying tech has performed perfectly,” Schulman said. “The promise of a distributed ledger is that it can be faster and cheaper, to settle transactions simultaneously with no middlemen. That’s an important thing.”\nImportantly, unlike previous waves of “blockchain, not bitcoin,” which mostly referred to permissioned blockchains, Tuesday’s conversations were OK with public ledgers such as Ethereum and the Stellar network.\nLynn Martin, president of the New York Stock Exchange, appeared to take a similar line, citing the potential benefits blockchain could bring to make equity issuance more efficient or allow settlement of financial trades to take place instantly rather than days later.\n“There is a way now that some of the technologies have been adopted and used to really make processes much more efficient,” Martin said.\nThat promise of wider blockchain applications was later echoed by former Indian central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan. But ultimately traditional finance’s commitment to the sector may have its limits: When asked, Schulman, Martin and State Street’s Ronald O'Hanley all said the tech they were most excited about was artificial intelligence, not blockchain.\nJust across the street from the forum’s main congress center, in a historic church transformed into a neon hub for hosting discussions about the future, Carmen Hett, treasurer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, detailed such an application – a recently launched blockchain payment product for distributing humanitarian aid in Ukraine.\nThe pilot project, which was rolled out in December with blockchain platform the Stellar Development Foundation, is at a far more advanced stage than one would expect, Hett explained during a panel discussion moderated by CoinDesk chief content officer Michael Casey. Putting donations on the blockchain promises “transparency and visibility,” and the Commission has a platform ready to deploy aid instantly, Hett said.\n“That's an amazing proposition. ... If we were to get 500 million (dollars) to deploy, we can actually do that today. So this is not a process that will take weeks and months,” Hett said. (Later that day, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister lauded virtual currency’s contribution to the war effort.)\nFurther down the famed promenade, big industry names from Solana and Ripple to the Global Blockchain Business Council banded together to launch a climate initiative that channels blockchain’s transparent record-keeping to help improve carbon emissions and credit tracking.\nConsumer protection\nAlthough regulators have so far largely focused on the threat of crypto contagion to financial stability, the trail of bankruptcies last year that wiped out billions of dollars in retail investments – most notably that of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX – may have highlighted a need for a shift in their focus.\nFor the traditional finance panel’s lone banker, the events of 2022 must make regulators stop obsessing about lenders bringing down the entire financial system, and more toward the risk of individual consumers getting ripped off by crypto scams.\n“It’s not that the regulators have ignored [financial innovations]. They’ve said if it’s not going to create systemic risk then I’m not going to focus on it,” said Ronald O'Hanley, chairman and chief executive officer of State Street.\n“FTX happened, somewhere between 2 and 3 trillion [dollars] of value was destroyed … a million investors or participants that were harmed,” he said. “There needs to be a change in regulatory mindset.”\nThat idea that regulators – including in the U.K., which is currently considering how to regulate crypto under its Financial Services and Markets Bill – might swerve in their focus was picked up at a separate panel hosted by stablecoin company Circle.\n“There's a real real emphasis on consumer protection this year,” said Isabella Chase, senior policy adviser at TRM Labs. “Unfortunately, the U.K. is a real hub for frauds and scams, and governments are really aware of this because it's a real human cost for them.”\nMinisters at the Treasury in London are due to issue a consultation on crypto laws imminently. The U.K. regulator has already said investors need clear, prominent warnings when they buy crypto. Lawmakers, worried about the impact on customers that may include their voters, may now be swayed by the collapse of FTX into being even stronger.\nOther panelists worried that regulators might start to take too much of a broad brush approach to regulating the sector – unlike that taken by the European Union, which distinguishes among financial instruments, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens and others using similar tech.\n“Frankly, the Europeans are doing the best of anybody right now,” said Lee Schneider, general counsel for Ava Labs, saying that in contrast jurisdictions such as Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong were “just sort of saying all crypto assets are one homogeneous asset class.”\n“Everybody knows that's not true, but everybody's ignoring it at their peril,” said Schneider.\nRead more: Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down but Not Out\nCORRECTION (Jan. 19, 07:37 UTC): Corrects spelling of Carmen Hett's name and name of Stellar Development Foundation.",

    "summary": "Holders of Dmitri Cherniak's NFT art project-meets-social experiment were instructed not to move, list or sell their assets for a year. The result was a test of patience and trust in the face of market uncertainty.",
    "content": "It's been a tough year to be a non-fungible token (NFT) holder. While 2021 welcomed high-value NFT sales, soaring cryptocurrency prices and an influx of new entrants into the space, this past year has seen trading slow and crypto prices drown in the sludge of an extended crypto winter.\nEthereum, which powers many popular NFT projects, was trading at around $4,000 just a year ago. Now, it's down to about $1,195. The global crypto market cap, once valued at about $3 trillion, currently stands at around $796 billion.\nGiven the deteriorating conditions over the last year, one would be safe to assume that many NFT holders would be eager to offload their assets and cut their losses. This would have been especially true for holders of generative artist Dmitri Cherniak's The Wrapture NFT project, a collection of 50 algorithmic art pieces made available to holders of his Eternal Pump collection that launched in December 2021.\nPart social experiment, part community building exercise, holders of the project were given a set of rules that would ultimately determine their NFT's rarity and long-term value: If no one moved, listed or sold their asset for a year, the project would be capped at 50 editions and they would be free to move their art without consequence. But if one collector were to \"break the rules,\" the remainder of the 666 editions would be released to the public for minting.\n\"Scarcity typically adds value to art,\" prominent collector Vincent Van Dough, who owns eight Wrapture NFTs, told me.\n\"I was hoping they would [wait],\" Cherniak said. \"I always rooted for it to hold.\" The artist also stored one of The Wrapture NFTs in his vault, meaning that he could have technically broken the rules at any point, leaving other collectors to face the repercussions.\nCollector Ayybee, who holds The Wrapture #40, recalled the turmoil of needing to rely on other holders' goodwill. \"It's sort of this form of the prisoner's dilemma,\" they told me, \"except we could communicate and coordinate.\" They said they considered \"all of the various possibilities as time passed\" when deciding whether to wait an entire year to derive any monetary value from their digital asset. \"One year is a millennium in this space,\" they said, adding that \"much of the intrigue as it relates to this project was being a participant in the process and so naturally, you want to see that through to the end.\"\nOthers were motivated to hold onto their NFTs as an unspoken commitment to the community of holders that emerged from the project. \"The social experiment aspect of the project is something that I think really resonated and was an important statement for the space,\" said Pete Molick, who owns The Wrapture #37.\n\"The Wrapture/Eternal Pump Holder group has become very close over the course of the last year,\" said Matt Miller, owner of The Wrapture #24. \"It would not only would it be unfair to my fellow collectors participating in this experiment, but it would also be a poor financial decision to flood the collection supply with 616 more outputs.\"\n\"There was a faction of people from the outside clamoring for a knight in shining armor to break the Wrapture and allow more people to collect, but ultimately it was never even a question to hold on,\" he added.\nA commentary on flipping culture\nIn early 2021, Cherniak was riding a high after the release of two successful NFT projects on the generative art platform Art Blocks – Ringers, a 1,000-edition, algorithmically generated project based on strings and pegs, and Eternal Pump, a 50-edition hand-coded animated project that nods to the culture of \"pumping\" up the price of an NFT project. Cherniak's work, along with the work of other artists like Art Blocks founder and Squiggles artist Erick \"Snowfro\" Calderon, Fidenza artist Tyler Hobbs and more, helped to revive the art style known as generative art.\n\"When Ringers was released in January, it helped kicked off a new wave of appreciation for generative art,\" Cherniak told me. \"And because of that, it also became highly valued and sought after.\" He added that the soon-after-released Eternal Pump added to \"the mania and insanity around a drop and the intense botting\" that resulted in automated systems buying and selling artwork for massive profits.\nBy the summer and fall of 2021, the Canadian-born, New York-based artist said that generative art had \"reached a new level of attention, partially due to the dollars being thrown at it.\" His third Art Blocks release, The Wrapture, was meant to be a \"conclusion to a trilogy of projects.\"\n\"It was originally supposed to be an exploration and combination of the visual forms from my first two drops, but became more of a conceptual project and my response to my experience in the previous year,\" he explained.\nAnyone that held an Eternal Pump NFT was invited to mint a Wrapture NFT, resulting in a tight-knit community of 37 NFT owners that held the project's future in their hands.\n\"In many ways, the Wrapture became a mirror to the NFT ecosystem,\" he said, \"And it was my attempt to make a point that art, and crypto art, does not need to be flipped or sold for short-term capital gains.\"\nChallenges in 2022\nThe 37 holders had to abide by one simple rule to increase the scarcity (and, presumably, value) of their NFTs: Hold on for dear life, often colloquially abbreviated to HODL.\n\"It was a unique opportunity to be a part of the art, so to speak,\" said Ayybee.\nThis may have been an easy task in 2021 when the crypto market was booming and NFTs often yielded great returns. But the mood of 2022 gradually became less optimistic – high-profile rug pull scams tainted the NFT space, wash trading obscured trading data and the collapse of crypto ecosystem Terra, crypto lender Celsius and most recently Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX resulted in volatility that rippled throughout the crypto space. Spooked traders left in droves.\nIn particular, the liquidation of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital almost derailed The Wrapture's plan entirely. The fund had suffered major losses from deteriorating crypto conditions and was ordered to liquidate its assets in June and filed for bankruptcy in July. Three Arrows Capital had purchased dozens of high-value collectibles – including four Wrapture NFTs – through its Starry Night Capital fund, and it was unclear what would happen to those assets as the company caved in.\n\"There was definitely a sense of collectively holding our breath not knowing exactly how that liquidation would be handled,\" said Molick.\nIn October, liquidators began moving Starry Night Capital's multi-million dollar NFT collection into a Gnosis Safe, which requires multiple signatures to approve a transaction. Hundreds of NFTs were transferred in the process – except for the four Wraptures, which remained untouched until the project's lock period ended earlier this month.\n\"We were all amazed that every NFT they owned was transferred to the liquidators with the exception of the Wraptures,\" said Miller.\n\"Liquidators opted not to move the Wraptures until it was over, which means not only were they aware of the rules of the game, they decided to actively engage in the game,\" added Cherniak.\nA bright spot in an otherwise dark year\nOver 365 days, none of the 37 Wrapture holders listed, moved or sold their NFTs. The experiment ended on December 17, capping the collection at 50 pieces and leaving holders with a sense of camaraderie and accomplishment.\nWrapture #7 was auctioned off by Cherniak on December 21, with 100% of proceeds to fund gastroesophageal cancer research at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. The winning bid of 169 ETH (about $203,000) was made by crypto art fund Curated.\nSeveral Wrapture NFTs have been transferred between wallets over the last week, though none have sold yet. At the time of writing, only one Wrapture was up for sale at 175 ETH (about $209,530), making the floor price of the project 175 ETH. The highest bid for a Wrapture NFT so far is 20 wrapped ether (wETH).\nSo what to make of this yearlong social experiment? Holders shared their thoughts.\n\"Can’t say I’m too surprised by the outcome,\" said Vincent Van Dough. \"Art Blocks and especially Eternal Pump went on a huge run last year before The Wrapture mint, so by that point, the only people left holding were long-term collectors who didn’t seem to have a need to take profits.\"\nOthers were moved by a sense of unity and market optimism.\n\"I think it shows that there is a true community of passionate collectors that are unwavering despite market conditions,\" said Miller.\n\"Undoubtedly it says that generative art is here to stay and that there is continuous growth that isn't necessarily tied to what's happening in the markets,\" added Ayybee.\nFor Cherniak, the experience was a testament to the creative use cases for blockchain technology.\n\"Ultimately, blockchains are social coordination technologies,\" he said. \"I think if anything, they just highlighted that NFTs and crypto don’t always need to be about the money.",

    "content": "Blockchain has merits as a technology but “gambling” with crypto should be avoided, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Friday.\nAppearing before students at Istanbul University during the Blockchain Istanbul Programme organized by his Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdoğan said he wants to see Turkey be a producer, not a consumer, in the digital assets world, according to a report by Alp Börü for CoinDesk Turkey.\nDespite Turkey being a fast-growing crypto market, the Erdoğan administration is not known to be friendly towards the industry. In 2021, the government banned the use of crypto for payments. Later in the year, Erdoğan made headlines over his plans to urgently send a restrictive crypto bill to the country’s parliament, but not much has since been heard of the legislation. The crypto market remains largely unregulated in the country.\nHis remarks seem to indicate an openness to at least some aspects of cryptocurrencies. He said Friday that Turkey seeks to establish its own virtual world, or metaverse. And earlier this year, the president attended a forum organized by AKP in the metaverse.\n“I advise our young people to take part in the change of innovations such as blockchain technology and turn to larger and more fertile channels instead of turning to crypto money gambling that has no basis,” Erdoğan said.\nBlockchain-based decentralized ledgers for immutable record-keeping has the “potential to radically change existing supply chains,” he said, also noting the impact blockchain technology could have on protecting intellectual property.\nOn the regulatory front, the president said that the country’s central bank is carrying out studies on cryptocurrencies.\n“Our other ministries also follow this technology closely in their own areas of responsibility,\" he said. \"We also closely monitor the activities of our private sector in blockchain technology.\"\nRead more: Turkish Authorities Seize Crypto Worth $40M in Illegal Gambling Sting",

    "title": "The Genesis Block: The First Bitcoin Block",
    "summary": "Today marks the 15-year anniversary of when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block.",
    "content": "The Genesis Block was simply the first block of bitcoin (BTC) to be mined. You might see it called Block 0 or Block 1.\nIt’s still there today and will remain there as long as any computer runs the Bitcoin software. Every node in the Bitcoin network can go and look at it, even though it now sits at the other end of a chain hundreds of thousands of blocks long. That’s the point of the blockchain.\nA block is a collection of transactions that get validated all together. The transactions in a block get added at once to the chain, which is the complete history of legitimate transactions using bitcoin. Every blockchain has a genesis block, just as every regular chain has a final link. People care especially about the first Bitcoin block because Bitcoin was the first blockchain and remains the largest cryptocurrency in the world.\nThe number of transactions in a Bitcoin block is variable, but these days it’s generally between 1,000 and 2,500. On the other hand, the time blocks take to get validated or “mined” is consistently around 10 minutes. This schedule is built into the software: If blocks are mined too quickly, the validation hurdle contrived to keep the network secure and ensure the mining process is competitive automatically gets harder, and vice versa.\nSo, the Genesis Block contains the first set of bitcoin transactions to be validated. In fact, there was only one transaction, which was the distribution of the 50 BTC reward for mining the block to a certain address. Miners are still rewarded today, though the reward has since declined to 6.25 BTC. In the case of the Genesis Block, there was only one person who knew about bitcoin to mine it: the original cryptocurrency’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\nSatoshi (almost certainly a pseudonym) mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That was three months after he or she published the Bitcoin white paper in an online cryptography forum. People now call Jan. 3 “Genesis Block Day.”\nThe first Bitcoin block\nSatoshi made the Genesis Block special in a number of ways. For one thing, the 50 BTC reward was sent to an address from which it can never be recovered. On a technical level, the 50 BTC transaction wasn't recorded as such in the same way as later transactions. That’s why any attempt to spend those coins would fail. Satoshi never commented on the reasons for that.\nIn a still more mysterious move, Satoshi wrote a message within the standard lines of data attached to the block. It was a headline from British newspaper The Times:\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\nAgain, Satoshi never explained this. But others have read heavily into the choice. One of Satoshi’s aims in creating Bitcoin might have been to save people from having to hand money over to a bank as an alternative to stashing cash under their mattress. In 2009, the great recession was in full swing. Some people had gone to their bank only to find their money was gone. Other people found their pensions had gone the same way. Many think it is no coincidence that Satoshi chose that particular headline to write into the Genesis Block. This was supposed to be the beginning of the end of people relying on banks so much that the government had to rescue them from their own mistakes using taxpayers’ money.\nWhether Satoshi’s comment was targeted mainly at banks or governments or both remains a topic of debate among Bitcoin enthusiasts.\nAnother theory is a little more mundane. The inclusion of a headline from that day proved that the code wasn't written before that day. Satoshi might just have wanted to dispel any suggestion he had mined the block in advance to give himself some advantage as its creator.\nSatoshi might have had all these things in mind. Barring a spectacular unmasking, we will never know for sure.\nIt is also peculiar that the second Bitcoin block was mined on Jan. 9, a whole six days after the first one. Remember, Bitcoin blocks are supposed to take 10 minutes to mine. There could be lots of reasons for the outlier block time. The algorithm that adjusts the difficulty of mining to maintain the 10 minutes only kicks in every two weeks or so. But the fun theory is that Satoshi was consciously echoing the six days that God takes to create the world in the Book of Genesis.\nHow are Bitcoin blocks different today?\nBitcoin blocks have changed a lot since 2009. They contain thousands of transactions, instead of one. They take 10 minutes to mine. As of January 2024, miners are rewarded with 6.25 BTC, after three “halvings” of the reward, which occur roughly every four years on a predetermined schedule. The next halving will likely take place in or around April 2024. Bitcoin blocks form an unbroken sequence, each specifically referencing the previous one, stretching all the way back to the Genesis Block.",

    "title": "Web 3 Isn’t Dead, Despite What Critics Might Say",
    "summary": "Web3 is designed for a future that will become increasingly distributed, and for this reason remains foundational to how some sectors will eventually operate.",
    "content": "“Web3” is the latest in a line of phrases that media pundits and technology evangelists alike have deemed a Holy Grail of tech development. Promises of “a new internet” and killer applications have resulted in much excitement and enthusiasm.\nThis, in turn, has set the stage for dramatic disappointment. This year has seen high-profile collapses of tokens, a sharp drop in interest in non-fungible token (NFT) markets, and the hotly contested metaverse territory continuing to figure out what exactly it will offer. On the heels of this turbulence, commentators have been quick to proclaim the early death of Web3. Jack Dorsey even announced “Web5,” which he touted as “extra decentralized.”\nJesse Morris is CEO at Energy Web, a nonprofit developing open-source products for energy systems to help accelerate the renewable energy transition.\nBut it would be a mistake to move on so soon when the solutions represented by Web3 are only getting started.\nWith the term being used so freely, it’s worth taking a moment to re-clarify what Web3 really means. While Web2 can be characterized by central platforms controlled by tech giants, Web3 refers to a variety of technologies and services that enable a new means of exchanging data and value between parties with built-in security, privacy, and efficiency. In practice, this means networks of businesses, individuals and devices, each with their own data silos, security and policies, can exchange data in an entirely new way.\nSee also: Why We Need to Build Web3 Differently | Opinion\nAt its core, Web3 is about decentralization. The technologies that enable it are primarily related to blockchain and cryptography, but these are the tools rather than the principle itself – a world where data from different businesses, individuals and physical devices can be seamlessly shared and verified in a privacy-preserving, low-cost way. It’s designed for a future that will become increasingly distributed, and for this reason remains foundational to how some sectors will eventually operate.\nRather than the end of the line for Web3, recent negativity can be compared to the first dot-com crash at the beginning of the millennium. It can be thought of as a readjustment in expectations that works to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current skeptical environment should be welcomed by the many developers currently working on applications that unlock actual value.\nWeb3 applications in real business settings have already shown themselves to be quietly transformational. For large banks, blockchain can make same-day international payments simpler and cheaper by reducing intermediaries in the process, a streamlining that couldn’t be achieved without a trusted technological infrastructure between parties. The rise of Web3 has also led to innovation in the peer-to-peer financial services space, enabling neobanks to offer services to the traditionally underbanked.\nSee also: Which Web 3 Protocols Are Most Likely to Succeed? A VC Suggests a Common Thread | Opinion\nSupply chains, meanwhile, are increasingly leveraging blockchain and other data-driven technologies to create new levels of trust, transparency and accountability across international value chains. This includes carbon efficiency and carbon accounting approaches that are pivotal to combating climate change.\nFurther ahead of the curve than any other, and perhaps also where there remains the most work to be done, is the energy sector. Web3 is uniquely well-suited to answer the longstanding need for a decentralized approach to energy markets and the much needed transformation of energy grids.\nFor the past 100 years, the model for energy markets has been the same. Large, fixed power plants produce energy flows with predictable operating parameters and peak periods. A one-way flow of power from utilities to consumers is met with a one-way flow of money in the opposite direction.\nToday, this has been turned on its head. Grid management now requires factoring in distributed renewable energy assets, behind-the-meter generation, consumers who can sell back to the grid and more. The power plant is now owned by you, me and the businesses around us, a distributed but connected system composed of networks of rooftop solar systems, inverters, batteries, EVs and smart appliances, making the generation, storage and demand picture far more complex.\nThe central issue is that while the hardware environment has changed dramatically, the software that underpins the grid hasn’t. Web2 technologies have a difficult time enabling devices owned by different people and organizations to communicate and exchange data with one another in order for all these assets to be integrated with the grid.\nWeb3 technologies, on the other hand, are ideally suited to the challenge. At the Energy Web Foundation, we were able to build a system from the ground up that can put all market participants – from the world’s biggest utilities to individual electric vehicles (EV) – into conversation with one another. Rather than keeping the data necessary to run the grid separated into siloes, our operating system allows for a shared digital infrastructure where participants can maintain their own platforms and parameters while sharing data in a trusted way. In Australia, a product based on this operating system has already been deployed in collaboration with the energy market operator. Utilities and aggregators are working together to operate a shared system, which sees the owners of small-scale assets being paid for the services they provide.\nThis kind of shared success is the measure by which Web3 will succeed or fail. It’s why I’m not worried when I see excitement deflating in the public eye. Once the rubble of hype cycles and overpromises clears away, what will be left is an infrastructure for creating stronger, fairer and more flexible systems – which is where the value for everyone really lies.",

The blockchain does not handle smart contracts or perform computations. Instead, these are functions Celestia’s model outsources to rollups or other blockchains, a core component of its flexible, modular design.\nSo far, the crypto landscape has been dominated by monolithic blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana, which have struggled with issues such as scalability and outages.\nRead More: Blockchain Infrastructure Project Eclipse Raises $15m To Build ‘Universal Layer-2’\n“For the past decade, crypto has been bottlenecked by an endless loop of new monolithic [layer 1] smart contract platforms, each racing to the bottom to sacrifice decentralization and security to provide cheaper transaction fees,” said Celestia Labs co-founder Mustafa Al-Bassam. “Web3 cannot scale within the constraints of a monolithic framework.”\nA modular blockchain, according to Celestia, allows the core functions of blockchains – consensus, settlement, data availability, and execution – to be decoupled into separate layers, avoiding the trilemma that typically plagues monolithic blockchains.\nDevelopers building Web3 applications in the Celestia network can also mix and match different kinds of infrastructure and still be interoperable.\n“Modular designs are unlocking rapid experimentation across the decentralized application stack,” said Bain Capital Crypto partner Alex Evans in a statement. “By minimizing base-layer complexity, Celestia offers cleaner abstractions for developers and greater sovereignty for communities of users.”\nCelestia launched its testnet in May 2022, but has yet to announce a token.\nUPDATE (Oct. 19, 16:38 UTC): Corrects nature of launch to testnet, not mainnet.",

    "content": "Upcoming layer 2 network Shibarium will soon join the ever-growing fray of Ethereum-based blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, looking to solve the problems of scalability, speed and expense.\nA beta testnet, or a blockchain that mimics real-world functioning, is expected to launch in the coming weeks.\nLayer 2 refers to a set of off-chain solutions (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1s that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. These bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees.\nIn an introductory post on Sunday, Shiba Inu developers said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the NFT sector is expected to heat up in the coming years, apart from Shibarium’s use as a cheap settlement for decentralized applications (dapps) built on the network.\nThe launch could contribute to strong fundamentals for shiba inu, formed in the previous bull market as a Shiba inu-themed meme coin that has since tried to position itself as a serious project with its own blockchain network and dApp ecosystem.\nThe move could further bolster the fundamentals of Shiba Inu’s three ecosystem tokens: shiba inu (SHIB), leash (LEASH) and bone (BONE), which together command over $5 billion in market capitalization.\nEach transaction on Shibarium will burn a certain amount of SHIB tokens, but the specific amount has not been decided yet. Burns refer to the permanent deletion of tokens from the total supply.\nHow validators work\nShibarium’s validators will lock up BONE to run the Heimdall validator, software that provides an overview of transactions, and Bor block producer nodes, a program that allows the integration of Ethereum into other networks. Validators are entities that maintain and approve transactions on any blockchain network.\nThe number of validators are limited to 100 slots. Validators are also required to stake a minimum of 10,000 BONE and all rewards will be paid in BONE. “The onboarding of these Validators will be done taking into account the experience, trust, knowledge and ensuring that these validators are committed to the health and integrity of Shibarium,” developers said.\n“The development team is currently evaluating potential gas fee rates for the blockchain network. The network's gas fees are expected to be lower than the current fees on the Ethereum mainnet,” they added.\nMeanwhile, a forthcoming TREAT token will be launched to incentivize liquidity pools on ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that uses SHIB, and provide users with low network fees and better rewards strategies, developers said in the post.\nSHIB, LEASH and BONE were nominally changed in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.",

    "content": "Input Output Global (IOG), the firm behind the Cardano blockchain, is releasing a new privacy-focused blockchain called Midnight and a token called dust to accompany the new network.\nMidnight, which is underpinned by zero-knowledge proof technology, is one of many side chains now being deployed around Cardano, and will go beyond previous privacy-coin projects by delivering zero-knowledge proof smart contracts, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson said during an event at Edinburgh University in Scotland on Friday.\nDegen Chain Racks up Millions in Volumes; Latest in Custodia Bank's Legal Battle Against the Fed\nThe system will walk the line between preserving privacy and allowing regulators and auditors a backdoor into the system when permission is granted, he said.\n“Midnight has evolved privacy-coin technology where everything was anonymous by default, which is what zcash and monero did with Snarks and ring signatures,” Hoskinson said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to two other privacy coins and their encryption methods.\n“This is a completely new way of writing and running private smart contracts and private computation. So you can have a private DEX (decentralized exchange) or go mine an anonymous data set or these types of things.”\nPrivacy coins have always been lionized by crypto libertarians, but have been viewed warily by regulators fearful of how the technology might help facilitate financial crime. Yet, privacy is something that every business has a legal requirement to explore these days, Hoskinson said, although he noted that the difficulty of figuring out how to add privacy to blockchains has prevented its adoption.\n“You need programmability; you can’t just take Zcash and fork it, and somehow it’ll work,” Hoskinson said of the protocol. “What was needed was the ability to write this stuff in a normal programming language, not some weird Snark thing, but JavaScript or something like that, something developers can understand and get a guarantee you have privacy.”\nA paper published two years back by IOG, titled \"Kachina,\" which dives into privacy-enhanced smart contracts, is now coming to fruition in the real world, Hoskinson said. This has generated interest within the once-hyped world of enterprise blockchains, he added, explaining that Midnight will be working with Hyperledger, for example, which is a consortium of large firms exploring private and permissioned ledgers for things like supply-chain management.\n“This is what the enterprise absolutely wants, and we have seen Walmart and some of the largest companies in the world working on privacy with Hyperledger,” Hoskinson said. “At the same time, we can service traditional cryptocurrency needs, especially when you look at DEXs that want to prevent front-running and these types of things.”",

    "summary": "But that shouldn’t disqualify blockchain technology. Regulators should steer clear of extreme measures, the former governor of India’s central bank told CoinDesk in Davos.",
    "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland — Crypto as a speculative asset class has had its “comeuppance,” said economist and the former governor of India’s central bank, Raghuram Rajan.\nBut that doesn’t mean the technology that underlies crypto deserves punishment as well – and regulators should be wary of innovation-stunting bans, he told CoinDesk at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday.\n“I don't think you want to rule out this technology and say it has failed as a speculative asset. I think it's had its comeuppance. But I think as a technology, I don't think we've seen the limits of it,” Rajan said.\nThe industry made a splash in Davos last May following a historic bull market that quickly turned into the worst crypto winter on record. But in the aftermath of a series of high-profile collapses culminating in the infamous fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, crypto advocates and companies in the Swiss town this year are already working to shift the focus towards building on blockchain technology.\nRajan agreed that’s where the focus should be. The crypto industry spent too much time chasing after the idea of creating an inflation-resistant “alternative to fiat money” that countered central banks “flooding the world with fake money.”\n“I think that was a weak rationale,” Rajan said.\nThe problem, as Rajan sees it, also arose from advocates of decentralization who argued that every ledger of transactions needed to be decentralized and it could be done without “trust” placed in currency issued and backed by a central bank.\n“Turns out you can't really do it, and you always depend on some central party,” Rajan said, adding the industry should focus more on use cases like improving cross-border transactions, “especially as countries start to get at loggerheads with each other.”\nRead more: New Global CBDC Platform Could Cut Payment Costs, IMF Says\nAs Rajan views it, crypto’s future could depend on its ability to move away from the narrative of distrust toward central banks and finding ways to coexist.\nThat means regulators have to play nice as well.\nCentral banks, for instance, should not aim to “displace the private sector” by issuing digital iterations of sovereign currencies, Rajan said. He added that central bank digital currencies should, rather than try to compete with the private sector, offer a public platform on which the private sector can operate.\n“I think, ultimately, that's a win-win,” he said.\nRajan added that, although policymakers should set up ways to “filter” out bad actors in the space banning crypto altogether – something that the Reserve Bank of India has wondered aloud on more than one occasion in the last few years – may not be the answer.\n“I really think you have to be very, very careful about bans because then you arrest development,” Rajan said.\nIn India’s case, the central bank may be under the impression that most retail investors crowding into the crypto space may not fully understand the risks involved, he said.\nOn Tuesday, discussions around crypto in Davos indicated the industry felt regulators may also need to consider a shift in their focus and move away from obsessing over crypto’s threat to financial stability – which turned out to be a moot point as the contagion from the many crypto bankruptcies last year failed to harm broader economies – to make concerted efforts to improve consumer protection.\nInnovation always begets some bad decisions and losses, according to Rajan, but that doesn’t mean new developments must be thwarted.\n“Allowing some freedom within constraints that might be aimed at getting the excess speculation as well as fraud out – that seems to me a better way to go than to just ban any technology,” he said.\nRead more: Blockchain’s Non-Crypto Applications Take Center Stage on Davos Day 2\nJack Schickler contributed reporting.",

    "content": "Police in the Firozabad district of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, have announced an initiative that will put public complaints on a blockchain.\nThe project is the first of its kind in India and is powered by Polygon, a scaling tool looking to facilitate lower-cost crypto transactions and uses the Ethereum blockchain. The portal, called \"police complaint on blockchain,\" will not charge users to file grievances or complaints and accommodates both Hindi and English languages. Complainants can check on the status of the case, know who the assigned officer is and get alerts on the progress of a complaint.\nIndia has a historically messy process for registering police complaints marred by corruption, bureaucratic delays, and retractions by complainants themselves. Officers are known to cut their caseloads by refusing to register crime complaints, and there have been instances where complainants were either forced or intimidated into altering their original complaints. India has more than 40 million pending court cases thanks in part to delays fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Now, once the complaint has been filed, it cannot be removed or changed, it will be immutable,\" said Ashish Tiwari, senior superintendent of police, Firozabad Police. \"We felt the need for this technology. Police stations in the area will have QR codes to scan to complete the form to register a complaint.\"\nThe portal was put together by Ankur Rakhi Sinha, the founder of AirChains, a Web3 software development platform, with the support of the police district's smart cell, which is a group of personnel within police departments equipped and acquainted with the latest technology to fight crime.\n\"This is very close to my heart,\" tweeted Polygon's co-founder Sandeep Nailwal. \"We grow up hearing about so many of such cases wherein due to some corruption in a local police department, victims (mostly of rapes) are not even able to register complaints or the complaints being manipulated. This could be a game-changer in ensuring right to justice,\" he added.\nIn India, after a complaint is filed, a First Information Report (FIR) is prepared by the police if they determine an official investigation is required. All complaints filed will go on the blockchain but not every complaint will progress into an FIR.\n“Every complaint will be assessed and if it is feasible then an FIR will be registered,\" Tiwari told CoinDesk, adding that the police will decide if an investigation is warranted within seven days of the complaint being filed.\nSimilar projects are in the pipeline in other states of India including Delhi, West Bengal, Assam and Chhattisgarh, according to a local news report.\nOfficials in India have also introduced blockchain “caste certificates” to up to 65,000 tribal members in a remote region in an attempt to stop fraudulent claims on government benefits for the disadvantaged.\nRead More: Tribal Groups in Remote Indian Area Get Blockchain Caste Certificates",

    "summary": "Chainlink said it is helping Belgium-based SWIFT make token transfers and communicate across all blockchain environments.",
    "content": "SWIFT and Chainlink’s “love story” began years ago when Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink’s co-founder, won its blockchain start-up competition.\n“You were actually one of the first startups that we bet on,” Strategy Director Jonathan Ehrenfeld Solé of SWIFT, which executes financial transactions and payments between banks worldwide, told Nazarov at this year's SmartCon. Now their partnership could ensure that blockchain becomes an integral part of the financial system.\nChainlink announced recently it is helping Belgium-based SWIFT make token transfers and communicate across all blockchain environments.\n“That'll accelerate the adoption of DLT [distributed ledger technology] blockchains and benefit various institutions all over the capital markets,\" Nazarov said at the conference.\nSo what is this significant protocol all about?\nRead more: SWIFT Partners With Crypto Data Provider Chainlink on Cross-Chain Protocol in TradFi Play\nWhat is Chainlink?\nThe protocol’s mission is to help enable the creation of innovative smart contracts and decentralized, peer-to-peer applications that can be used by different types of enterprises across the globe, plus improve the way people access blockchain technology. An example of this is its network of oracles that enable the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access data sources like weather information.\nChainlink Labs was founded in 2014, under the name SmartContract.com, a blockchain technology startup. Steve Ellis, Ari Juels and Sergey Nazarov published a white paper on Chainlink in September 2017. Nazarov’s track record with crypto technology dates back to 2011.\nSteve Ellis also co-founded a crypto company in 2014 called the Secure Asset Exchange, and was a software engineer before that. Meanwhile, Ari Juels is a faculty member at Cornell Tech in New York and co-director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3). He is currently the chief scientist at Chainlink Labs.\nChainlink operates on Ethereum Virtual Machine-based (EVM) chains that can execute smart contracts such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche Mainnet and Fantom, Marc Arjoon, research associate at digital asset management firm CoinShares said in an interview with CoinDesk. It also supports non-EVM chains like Solana. Chainlink does not have its own blockchain.\nWhat exactly is Chainlink doing with SWIFT?\nChainlink is working with SWIFT on a proof-of-concept (PoC), where it is exploring using the protocol's cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) to help the interbank network communicate and transfer tokens across all blockchain environments. SWIFT is an interbank messaging system that connects to banks and enables cross-border payments.\nThe CCIP allows smart contracts, which are tools that can automatically execute functions after certain criteria is met, to communicate across multiple blockchains. Developers can easily build applications on top of it.\n“So from SWIFT’s side, it becomes a lot more powerful because instead of just messaging, it can do settlements as well now, not directly but through the blockchain,” Arjoon said. Typically SWIFT just delivers the information from banks for example, while the banks handle the actual settlement.\nWhy would SWIFT partner with Chainlink?\nChainlink has 47% of the total value secured by all oracles, while the rest is distributed across competitors like WINKLink (17.45%). This made it the perfect candidate for a collaboration like this.\n\"It's ... [partly] first mover's advantage ... they pioneered this space,\" Arjoon said of SWIFT. There is also “undeniable interest” in crypto from institutional investors, SWIFT’s Solé said at the conference.\nSWIFT, an international cooperative owned by member financial institutions, is well positioned to lead the charge in putting more assets on-chain. Its partnership with Chainlink allows banks to test the waters with blockchain technology without triggering undue regulatory scrutiny.\n“If banks wanted to interact with blockchains, without using SWIFT, without using Chainlink, that would take years and a lot of overhead costs and there's a lot of regulatory oversight,” Arjoon said. Whereas together they can combine their networks.\n\"We connect to 11,000 banks, [Chainlink] connects to 15 blockchains,” Solé said at the conference. “Then you have these two infrastructures that are secure, that are reliable, that are scalable, that can actually work so that you can buy an asset wherever you want, and you can transact it in whatever country.”\nWhat else does Chainlink do?\nIt provides data feeds. This enables companies to connect smart contracts with real world data such as asset prices and reserve balances.\nFor example, if Compound, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, wants to get the price of a token, it would contact Chainlink’s oracle. On the back end, different exchanges would submit data to the oracle and Chainlink would combine these messages, Arjoon said.\nChainlink has also developed a programmable token bridge built on the CCIP that enables developers to transfer tokens across blockchain networks. It has an automation service, a verifiable source of randomness for smart contract developers (like a random number generator), and a way to monitor reserves. It sets out where the protocol is going in its 2021 white paper.\nLINK\nChainlink has its own coin, called LINK, an Ethereum token that drives Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.\nThe Chainlink network uses LINK to pay its node operators (run by people) a reward to retrieve data from off-chain data feeds and then delivering that data on-chain to the smart contract, its white paper said. You need LINK to pay for Chainlink’s services. Node operators are the entities that are responsible for running Chainlink's hardware and software and monitoring the network. They also watch out for incoming data requests from smart contracts.\nSoon, Chainlink will upgrade so that LINK can be staked on its platform and rewards can be retrieved to help secure its oracle services. The project will be underway by December.\nRead more: SWIFT Says It's Proved It Can Be the Way Forward for Global CBDCs\nCORRECTION (Nov. 3, 14:38 UTC): This article has been updated to correct key facts about Chainlink and its operations.",

    "content": "StarkWare, a creator of blockchain scaling systems that has reached an $8 billion valuation last year, announced plans on Monday to open source its core cryptographic software tool.\nThe technology of Israel-based StarkWare tackles the scalability issues of Ethereum, which cause slow throughput and high gas or transaction fees. The company has two platforms: the StarkEx scaling engine and StarkNet, which puts the technologies in the hands of developers building decentralized applications (dapps). StarkWare plans to open source the STARK Prover technology that powers those projects.\nThe announcement was made during the two-day StarkWare Sessions 2023 event in Tel Aviv, Israel. The company said the plan to open source will take time to implement, but StarkWare is committed to making the entire tech stack transparent for developers.\n“Every step we take to provide infrastructure, and to make it accessible and decentralized, is a catalyst for devs to build,” StarkWare co-founder and President Eli Ben-Sasson said in a statement at the summit. “And the quicker and more broadly they build, the faster we’ll see mass onboarding to solutions that truly enable people to manage their own funds. So there’s a direct line between open-sourcing key tech and popularizing self-custody.”\nCrypto infrastructure projects have an increased profile after the collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX. In January, investments in crypto companies fell 91% year over year as backers moved away from centralized finance projects. Infrastructure, however, remained relatively strong and was the highest-earning vertical.\nRead more: StarkWare Launches Nonprofit Foundation to Fuel StarkNet Ecosystem\nUPDATE (UTC 14:38): Removes extraneous text.",

    "title": "In Davos, Blockchain Yields More Promises Than Problems",
    "summary": "A United Nations official makes the case for the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.",
    "content": "About half of the estimated 500 companies attending the 2023 annual World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, are technology companies and startups. You see them stretching out over the Promenade – the main street running through the city center where all the action happens. The showcases are demoing products and services in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), robotics, 3D printing and the Internet of Things (IoT), offering a taste of the latest and greatest to come.\nOne of the most notable topics being discussed – on panels, at events, over live broadcast – is the future of money. Of course, when talking about the future of money you must also mention crypto. The conversations I’ve overheard or been a part of, so far, have concerned the pragmatic (using blockchain for traceability), the political (using blockchain for anti-corruption), the futuristic (decentralized finance and the metaverse) and the hopeful (incentivizing climate action through Web3).\nAdvit Nath is the controller and director of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development and a regional ambassador for the Global Blockchain Business Council.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that people are talking about tech – the conversation was primed. The WEF’s recently released \"2023 Global Risk Report\" cited “technological disruption” as a top risk. With the high-profile busts of major crypto firms still fresh, there is pessimism among many in Davos about crypto.\nSee also: Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down but Not Out\nAs well as being a tech enthusiast, my day job is working in finance and innovation for a United Nations specialized agency and international financial institution called the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which often gives me a first-hand look at how technological solutions are being applied. It’s clear, despite the recent negative headlines, that blockchain technology has more promises than problems.\nIt’s important to make the distinction between blockchain – the technology behind cryptocurrencies – and crypto itself. Decentralized digital currency as a concept is not going to disappear, but cryptocurrencies that are not backed by real assets in a significant way will likely not survive. We are going to see fewer industry players willing to take the financial and reputational risks of being exposed to crypto.\nHowever, blockchain as a technology will continue to grow exponentially and its use cases expand. The real-world applications of blockchain, many already in use by organizations focused on international development, offer far greater utility and cost savings.\nOn a panel organized by the Global Blockchain Business Council covering the topic of “Blockchain for Public Institutions (Governments and International Organisations),” I spoke about the challenges of previous food crises across the world and how blockchain technology has and can be applied. Blockchain is already being used in development projects to increase traceability and auditability of funds from donors to farmers as well as the traceability of food, raw materials and energy in the agriculture supply chain – at a relatively low cost.\nTake just one example of IFAD's Kenya cereal climate-smart agriculture (KCAP) project. Through this initiative we proved that we could trace every dollar of the $100 million project spanning 50 downstream actors by placing the information on a secure blockchain. (While we’re blockchain agnostic, the project is using a hybrid public-private, permissioned version of Ethereum, ensuring that personal data is kept secure off-chain.) This system offers near-real-time development impact results, directly from farmers.\nUsing blockchain in this way not only brings full transparency of the flow of funds from donors to farmers but ensures compliance through automated checks with our anti-money laundering software. Further, it enables the U.N. to automate a number of services. For instance, farmers can now speed up payments to their vendors with a click of a button on a mobile phone.\nSee also: This United Nations-Associated NFT Project Is Helping Fight Climate Change\nNowhere is the value and utility of crypto more apparent than in stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to keep its value pegged to a fiat currency. Stablecoins that are backed by reserves that are independently audited could be a means that cut through bureaucratic red tape and enable anyone to move money across borders in a matter of seconds.\nDavos is where policy is made and world leaders meet. I like to think I’m helping to support the ongoing digital transformation by sharing stories about on-the-ground use cases of blockchain. Digital money is only becoming a more practical solution as the number of on- and off-ramps between crypto and fiat currencies increases – an easy lesson to remember when surrounded by the snow-capped Swiss mountains.",

    "summary": "A sustained decline in bitcoin owned by long-term holders may mean a widespread loss of conviction, Glassnode said.",
    "content": "Long-term bitcoin (BTC) holders' resolve to keep building their coin stashes has weakened amid fears that the implosion of crypto exchange FTX will prolong the crypto winter. The exchange, founded by entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried and formerly the third largest in the world, filed for bankruptcy last week.\nThe change in stance is notable because the investors weren't fazed in the third quarter even as macro traders left the market, keeping bitcoin resilient to the macroeconomy-induced turmoil in traditional assets. Their shift now to distribution from accumulation perhaps represents concern about the strength of the market following FTX's collapse.\n\"There has certainly been a degree of immediate panic within the HODLer cohort,\" analytics firm Glassnode said in a weekly report published Monday, referring to the decline in the supply owned by long-term holders and the movement of inactive coins.\nThe total amount of circulating supply owned by long-term holders has declined by 61,500 BTC ($1.03 billion) since Nov. 6, marking a shift away from accumulation observed between the end of June and early November, data published by Glassnode shows.\nAnother metric, the long-term holder net position change, shows more than 48,000 BTC were spent in the week ended Sunday. Glassnode defines long-term holder supply as the one that is statistically the least likely to be spent. In addition, more than 97,000 BTC that were inactive or dormant for over a year moved last week and possibly returned to the cryptocurrency's circulating supply.\nAccording to digital assets data provider Amberdata, FTX's implosion will have many consequences, including the \"potential demonization of crypto space politically and a daisy chain of balance sheet capital short-falls for various institutions.\" Some analysts studying chart patterns see bitcoin falling to $13,000 in the near term.\nWhile long-term holders have begun distributing coins, it's still too early to call a long-lasting bearish shift in sentiment, according to Glassnode.\n\"A sustained push higher in older coins being spent, and a decline in LTH supply would be clear warning signs that a more widespread loss of conviction and concern may be in play,\" Glassnode noted, using an acronym for long-term holders.",

    "title": "How to Level Up Your Knowledge of Web3 Gaming",
    "summary": "Blockchain technology is redefining the gaming industry and giving players an opportunity to own their digital identities and assets. Here's how to get started.",
    "content": "Video games, which were once branded the catalyst for societal ruin by concerned parents everywhere, are now being embraced as a tool for mass adoption in the crypto sector.\nInvestors are betting big on Web3 gaming, or games underpinned by blockchain technology, even amid an extended crypto winter that has chilled many other markets. According to a report from blockchain data firm DappRadar, $748 million was raised in August 2022 for the development of new Web3 games.\nBut despite excitement among industry insiders and crypto gamers, a study from game publisher Coda Labs found that only 12% of gamers surveyed had tried playing a Web3 game and only 3% owned a non-fungible token (NFT).\n“I still see Web3 gaming as being very early,” said Roshni Cox, chief operating officer at Hellebore, a blockchain-based game studio. “Anyone that's involved now is helping to shape it.”\nIt’s clear that there is an institutional interest in building out the Web3 gaming sector, though brands will need to come up with solutions to better bring existing gamers into the fold. Today’s gamers, artists, creatives and influencers should start learning about blockchain-based gaming to stay ahead of the curve, and even taking small steps, like setting up a crypto wallet, can help interested parties become more familiar with the budding technology.\nAhead are some takes from industry experts such as Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of leading blockchain game publisher Animoca Brands, about the future of Web3 gaming and how to break into the budding industry.\nWhat is Web3 gaming?\nWeb3 gaming is an umbrella term to describe games that use cryptocurrency, NFTs or blockchain technology to augment the user experience. The goal of these blockchain-based projects is to empower players and offer them more control over their digital identities and assets.\nIn theory, Web3 games can have the same appeal as other types of video games like massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), puzzle games and strategy games. But blockchain technology helps to propel those games forward by offering cryptographically secured payment rails and verifiable ownership over digital in-game assets through NFTs.\n“Web3 doesn’t really change the quality of the game,” Siu said. “It shouldn’t change how the game should look or why the game is exciting. All it does is open up the ability to have new financial systems in the game.”\nTypes of Web3 games\nWeb3 gaming is still nascent, but over the past few years, several popular categories of have emerged, each using blockchain technology in unique ways:\nThere have also been examples of games that found creative ways to incorporate blockchain technology into their experience. In September 2021, a blockchain project called Loot launched a collection of 8,000 text-based NFTs meant to be used as items in games created by the community.\nSeveral existing Web2 games have also recently embraced NFTs, including Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint and Square Enix's Final Fantasy.\nNFTs as new revenue streams for gamers\nBlockchain games often offer in-game assets as NFTs that players can earn or purchase.\nNFTs are cryptographic tokens that allow players to verify ownership of a particular item. For gamers, that could mean in-game skins, rare collectibles or access passes to exclusive content or future releases – concepts gamers are already familiar with. With Web3, they are made more secure on a blockchain.\n“The easiest way to explain to a gamer the value that they're getting with any sort of blockchain technology is that these are digital collectibles,” Hellebore's Cox said. “Digital collectibles are never going to go away, it's just now in a digitized form for a digitally native person.”\nNFTs can also be traded and sold in-game and on secondary marketplaces, opening up new revenue streams for players.\n“Gamers themselves are very entrepreneurial people,” said John Linden, CEO of game technology company Mythical Games. “I think what we're going to see is players that become entrepreneurial inside the games.”\nJonathan Brun, CEO and co-founder of metaverse search engine Lighthouse, calls this aspect of Web3 gaming “a paradigm shift.” Roughly $54 billion is spent annually on virtual goods, skins and lives, according to JP Morgan’s 2022 Opportunities in the Metaverse report. Using blockchain technology, these types of assets can be traded and resold on secondary marketplaces, creating new opportunities for interaction and monetization.\n“Once you know you can resell [digital assets], it makes sense to expect this activity is going to increase,” Brun said.\nWeb3 also demands that industry leaders revisit existing fee structures that favor traditional tech companies, Siu explained.\n“The gaming industry last year generated over $20 billion in revenue, which is bigger than music and film combined,” he said. “On top of that, 30% [in fees] typically goes to platforms – whether Apple or Google or Steam. We're talking about a sum total of over $100 billion of extracted value from the gaming industry – how much of that $100 billion actually goes back [to the gamers]?”\nData ownership and identity management\nWeb3 gaming proposes a future in which players can have more control of their online identity and data. Crypto wallets could one day act as an alternative to existing single sign-on methods, allowing users to consolidate their logins and prevent their data from being shared with third parties.\nWhile the technology (and its adoption) are still early, decentralized identity products like Disco are cropping up. Ideally, Web3 will allow players to travel through various gaming worlds and experiences and maintain ownership over a singular digital identity that is both secure and user owned.\nSeveral companies, including Ubisoft, Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands, are exploring ways to bring these interoperable digital identities into the metaverse.\n“Our long-term efforts led us to understand how blockchain’s decentralized approach could genuinely make players stakeholders of our games, in a way that is also sustainable for our industry, placing back into their hands the value they generate through the time they spend, the items they buy or the content they create online,” said Nicolas Pouard, vice president of Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab, when the French video-game publisher launched its NFT platform Quartz in December 2021.\nYour Web3 gaming toolkit\nIf you are a developer or gamer and are interested in Web3 gaming, there are several steps you can take to make yourself more familiar with the sector:\nSet up a crypto wallet\nThe first thing to do when exploring Web3 gaming is to set up a blockchain wallet, according to Brun.\nSome Web3 gaming companies are simplifying this step by setting users up with what’s known as a custodial crypto wallet that is managed and secured by the platform. Users access their wallets like they would a traditional gaming account (likely a username and password), but their digital assets are stored in a wallet hosted by the platform.\nIn some cases, platforms that use this approach aim to help players switch to a self-custody wallet once they are ready to take full ownership of their digital assets.\nFor instance, Mythical Games’ Mythical Platform, a full-service blockchain integration system, is built on the company’s unique blockchain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This allows players who are new to the sector to use the platform’s custodial wallet, while more advanced players have the option to link their own wallets via bridges between the Mythical Chain and the Ethereum blockchain.\n“We will eventually go non-custodial or we will let players opt in to become non-custodial,” Linden said, noting that the Mythical Games sees this level of adoption as a phased rollout requiring more consumer education. Less than 5% of players were interested in self-custody as of December 2022, he estimated: “There’s a small percentage. It's growing, but very slowly. But when you go non-custodial, you have more issues around scams and things like that.”\nLearn about user-generated content tools\nPopular among many burgeoning Web3 gaming worlds are contests, incentives and collaborations that encourage players to contribute or design gaming experiences. This type of content is called user-generated content.\nFélix Bossé, Lighthouse’s metaverse researcher, takes pride in experimenting with user-generated content throughout popular metaverse worlds like Voxels and Mona. He designed a 3D pumpkin patch on the Ethereum-based platform Hyperfy using Blender, an open-source 3D animation tool. With community input, Bossé even penned a storyline describing a witch who stole the pumpkins and then challenged his peers to \"save Halloween\" by playing.\n“It was a really fun way for me to experiment with community-built worlds and decentralized world-building,” Bossé said.\nBrush up on financial literacy\nWeb3 gaming requires that players enhance their understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain payment tools. This can make some gamers “fearful,” said Siu.\n“[Some gamers] don't understand financial systems,” he said. “A bank account allows you to deposit money, but that doesn't actually mean you're investing. Nor does it mean that you know anything about earning yield. I think this comes down to financial education.”\nIf you are looking for a place to start, here are pieces on why people invest in cryptocurrency, how to pick the right play-to-earn game and how to invest in the metaverse.\nSome digital assets can be highly speculative, and so it’s important to manage your funds wisely and exercise caution when making high-risk bets.\nOf course, Web3 gaming isn't necessarily about getting rich quickly. Rather, it’s about redefining the gaming industry and giving players an opportunity to own their identities and assets within gaming worlds and across platforms.",

    "content": "The integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in financial planning and portfolio construction holds immense potential for efficiency, accuracy and security in the industry.\nThe use of blockchain and AI in this field could revolutionize the way financial advisors build portfolios and manage client information.\nYou're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.\nFinancial planning\nIn the field of financial planning, the integration of AI and blockchain technology could provide a much-needed upgrade. AI algorithms could analyze vast amounts of data to assist in making informed decisions regarding investments, taxes and insurance.\nThe algorithms could make real-time adjustments to financial plans, automate updates to plans based on changing legislation and reduce the risk of errors and fraudulent activities – all in a matter of seconds. This would lead to more efficient and accurate financial plans, freeing up time for financial advisors to focus on providing personalized advice and improving client relationships.\nBy utilizing the secure and transparent platform provided by blockchain, AI algorithms could also analyze and securely store sensitive financial information such as Social Security income information and tax information. This could allow for faster and more accurate calculations, potentially leading to financial plans that automatically adapt in real time without the need for manual updates.\nRead more: Here’s Why Artificial Intelligence Focused Cryptocurrencies Are Vastly Outperforming Bitcoin\nPortfolio construction\nTraditionally, portfolios have consisted of a mix of stocks, bonds, cash and sometimes a few alternative investments. However, with the advent of non-fungible tokens, the future of portfolio construction could be changing.\nNFTs allow for the fractional ownership and sale of any asset through smart contracts stored on a blockchain, potentially enabling portfolios to hold unique assets such as music albums, real estate, direct-held businesses, watches and artwork.\nThese new investment opportunities would allow clients of financial advisors to not only own unique assets, but to generate income from them in various ways.\nAll of this opens up new possibilities for investment and brings us closer to a future where the average person's portfolio may resemble that of a hedge fund or venture capital fund. By exploring these cutting-edge technologies, financial planners and investors alike may be able to create a more diverse and secure investment portfolio with an extremely wide array of assets.\nWatch: How AI Could Shape the Future of the NFT Market\nEstate planning\nEstate planning involves the creation and implementation of a plan for the transfer of assets after death or while alive but incapacitated. It’s often a painful and expensive process that can be hard to implement properly.\nWith the integration of blockchain and AI in estate planning, smart contracts could be used to create, monitor and implement estate plans, potentially reducing the risk of processing problems. The use of AI algorithms in estate planning could provide real-time updates on changes in assets, the law and the market, allowing for a more accurate and up-to-date estate plan.\nSmart contracts on the blockchain could automate the distribution of assets and ensure they are allocated according to the wishes of the individual, without the risk of fraud or human error. Blockchain could also ensure that all estate-related information and transactions are secure, reducing the risk of data breaches.\nHuman vs. technology debate\nFor decades, the financial advisory business has remained largely unchanged. However, these cutting-edge technologies are set to revolutionize the industry and have for years sparked a human vs. technology debate in the realm of financial advice.\nThe incorporation of AI and blockchain technologies into the financial industry will automate many routine and complex tasks, freeing financial advisors to focus on higher-value activities that require their unique skills and expertise.\nDespite these advancements, the human element of financial advice will remain critical. Clients seek not only knowledgeable financial advice but also a personal touch, and financial advisors who understand the human behind the client will continue to be in high demand.\nRead more: Crypto AI Needs a Showcase to Know What's Real\nPreparing for the future\nGoing forward, financial advisors will need to be proactive in their preparation to effectively incorporate AI and blockchain technologies into their practice. They will need to pay attention to not only the possible implementations of the technology but also to regulation of them and how that will affect their practice.\nThis means financial advisors will need to stay informed and educated about the latest advancements and developments in AI and blockchain technology and make any necessary updates to their processes to stay ahead of the curve.\nEqually important, advisors must educate their clients on the benefits and implications of these new technologies, working together with them to develop plans that leverage their investments. By staying ahead of the curve, financial advisors and their clients can reap the benefits of these new technologies while ensuring their financial plans remain effective, efficient and secure.\nAs the financial industry evolves and technologies evolve, the role of the human financial advisor will become no less important. The personalized touch that technology simply cannot replicate will never be replaced. Financial advisors who are able to leverage new technologies, stay up to date on the changing landscape around us – while also focusing on improving their communication skills – will be at the forefront of the industry and well-positioned for success in the years to come.",

    "title": "How to Turn Your Community Into a DAO",
    "summary": "Understanding how a decentralized autonomous organization works is the first step to bringing your existing community into Web3.",
    "content": "Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are changing the way communities organize and operate in Web3. The term refers to a group with a shared goal that is governed without a traditional centralized leadership structure. Essentially, members of a DAO vote on important issues related to the organization, such as how to allocate money or build new products.\nThis blockchain-based structure is designed to provide projects, businesses and communities with a more democratic management process, fostering better coordination among creators, developers and investors. But groups don’t necessarily need to start out as DAOs, and there are ways to integrate these concepts into an existing community structure.\nFinding inspiration: DAO success stories\nSince the first DAO (aptly named The DAO) was formed in 2016, the concept has expanded across industries, including finance, fashion, journalism and more. DAOs rely on smart contracts to automatically execute tasks when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\nSeveral successful DAOs have sprung up in recent years, showcasing a variety of use cases.\nMetaverse platform Decentraland, for example, created the Decentraland DAO to govern its native cryptocurrency MANA and virtual real estate parcels called LAND. Members of the DAO can bring forward and vote on proposals, allowing the community to shape the platform’s future collaboratively. The virtual world even threw away the private key that controlled the smart contract for MANA, fully decentralizing its governance token.\nOther DAOs form decentralized community fundraisers around a shared goal. ConstitutionDAO, for example, sought to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution at auction. LinksDAO, which is focused on building the world’s greatest golf and leisure club, sold memberships to its future club as non-fungible tokens (NFT), netting millions of dollars without even owning a golf course.\nBegin building your DAO\nUnderstanding how DAOs work and modeling your structure after other DAOs can help you shift your existing community into Web3.\nAligning your DAO identity\nThe first step is setting your DAO’s purpose. This is your mission statement and unites your community around a common interest or goal. Work closely with your founding team to build a community where people want to be, and prioritize engagement over growth.\nIn line with having a common goal, DAO creation and management tool Aragon suggests that creating a distinct brand identity will help define your purpose. This is how you visually represent your ideas and it is key to developing your community, your user base, the amount of media coverage you receive and building your reputation in Web3.\nSelect the best blockchain for your needs\nChoosing which blockchain to use is important in determining the direction of your organization. Because DAOs have no central leadership and voting on proposals often occurs on-chain, blockchain ledgers help keep the inner workings of the organization transparent and immutable.\nEthereum and Polygon are popular blockchain options for DAOs, and you should consider gas fees, security and scalability of the network when making a decision.\nDefine your governance process\nNext, define how your DAO will make decisions and who can make those decisions. Creating an effective structure will determine how engaged your community is and how efficient and safe the process will be.\nThere’s no right or wrong way to structure your governance. Currently, DAOs allow members to vote based on the number of tokens they hold or via their crypto wallets.\nTokens are an effective way to create weighted voting – meaning, the more tokens a member holds the more weighted their vote. Wallet-based voting, on the other hand, gives each member one vote per wallet, minimizing the ability to simply purchase voting power.\nAccording to Aragon, many DAOs start off with wallet-based voting before they create a governance token and evolve their process.\nMint and manage DAO governance tokens\nIf you decide to use a token-based voting system, you’ll need to mint and manage your tokens. Some projects choose to sell non-fungible tokens to allocate membership, while others choose to create a native token to simplify the process.\nOnce you decide on a name for your tokens, you’ll need to determine how many tokens you want to mint. This could be in the form of a fixed supply of tokens or a variable supply that can fluctuate over time. You’ll also need to consider the maximum supply of tokens that will be minted and the number of tokens currently in circulation, or the circulating supply.\nOnce minted, the tokens can be given to specific people or can be bought and sold on either a primary or secondary exchange. Funds raised by the community are often managed by a community treasury.\nIt’s important to note that in some parts of the world, your tokens may be deemed a security and may be subject to local regulation and taxes. It’s important to consider the legal implications of token-based voting before going down that route.\nCreating a forum and proposal\nA DAO proposal is an idea that a community or DAO member wants the DAO to consider. It usually consists of a document outlining an idea, how it will be put into practice and the necessary funds needed.\nProposals should be fully formed ideas that have moved beyond the brainstorming phase and are ready for the community to evaluate. These proposals should go on a forum where open discussion is encouraged for those who get to vote.\nDAOs need to set a minimum participation of voters to be present for a vote to be valid, sometimes called a quorum, along with a pass rate, or the number of affirmative votes needed to pass a proposal. There should also be a voting period, or an amount of time where a vote is live, in order to fairly determine the result.\nDetermine DAO tools\nThe software, applications and smart contracts a DAO uses to run are referred to as DAO tooling. Your community won't be able to communicate, send money, pay contributors or organize legal documents without it.\nThere are a variety of tools available for different processes – for example, Discord is a tool commonly used for discussion and community management, while a Gnosis Safe is sometimes used as a multisig wallet for moving group funds.\nSimply put, DAO tooling is how you manage your organization.\nCoordination is key\nNow that you’ve made major decisions for your DAO, it’s time to work with your community to achieve your common goal. Voting on important decisions will only grow more difficult as your community grows, so it’s important to organize and adapt strategies early.\nIf you're seeking more information on how to build your DAO, there exists a vast ecosystem of communities that can share tips and tools.",

In other areas, it made announcements but didn’t deliver.\"\nSignificantly, the government will assess which tokens or \"digital assets should be regulated by financial services laws\" as part of its ongoing \"token mapping\" work. In August, Australia's Treasury announced it would prioritize token mapping work, which involves uncovering the characteristics of all digital asset tokens in Australia including charting the type of crypto asset, its underlying code and any other defining technological feature.\nThe framework for the licensing and regulation of crypto service providers will be part of \"a strategic plan for the payments system\" of Australia set to be released in the first quarter of 2023 for which a consultation paper was released simultaneously. The consultation paper invites feedback till Feb. 6, 2023, and touches upon various aspects of the crypto eco system including digital wallets, stablecoins, crypto assets and central bank digital currencies.\nThis also includes exploring “the policy rationale for an Australian CBDC, including investigating the economic, legal, regulatory and technological considerations associated with an Australian CBDC.” Australia's central bank is expected to complete its CBDC pilot by mid-2023.\nOn Tuesday, news emerged that CEO Laura Mercurio departed Blockchain Australia, the nation's industry body advocating for appropriate regulation and policy.

    "content": "Forget the Great Reset. Members of the industry known as “crypto” (or is it “blockchain,” “digital assets” or “distributed ledger technology?”) attending this week’s World Economic Forum under the shadow of the crisis known as “FTX” are spurring a great rebrand.\nIn the wake of the Bahamas-based exchange’s meltdown, “crypto” and “NFTs” (non-fungible tokens) have become trigger words for skeptics who dismiss this technology as hot air with no utility – much as “blockchain” was viewed in 2018 around the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, when, in one notorious case, the Long Island Iced Tea company infamously renamed itself Long Blockchain Corp.\nHence, there was talk of a new lexicon (we’re stuck with “crypto” for now) as business leaders tried to convince policymakers attending the talkfest in Davos, Switzerland, of the need for constructive regulation or sought deals, engagement or just acceptance by leaders of mainstream companies who’d also turned out in force.\nYou’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\nI’m sure many readers of this column will recoil at this effort. Some may even see it as a centralizing power grab.\nMaybe that’s fair. This annual gathering in the Swiss Alps, often cited for hypocrisy, empty talk and elitism, is a lightning rod among many who believe in the potential for cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies to upend the existing, inequitable global economy. You don’t have to share the conspiracy theorists’ views of WEF founder Klaus Schwab’s “Great Reset” idea to have concerns about the many Davos member companies and institutions whose business models perpetuate that system’s exploitative, centralized power structure.\nBut it’s also clear that “crypto” is now being widely associated with “have-fun-staying-poor” crypto bros and with what MIT Digital Currency Initiative Director Neha Narula calls “token casinos.” That the word now makes policymakers and executives squeamish is a barrier to progress for any crypto industry leader looking to engage with them.\nIt might not be such a bad idea to find words that don’t sound so foreign or threatening, words that encapsulate more universally and positively recognized ideas.\nBrynly Llyr, the head of blockchain and digital assets at the World Economic Forum, suggested “decentralized systems” as a phrase that’s accurately descriptive of the function this technology plays without risking a negative association with crypto culture.\nWatch: Crypto Outlook at The World Economic Forum\nOthers are simply resurfacing “blockchain,” hoping it will be more palatable to businesses that want to use these systems to manage enterprise needs. (One concern here is that word was associated with the “permissioned” blockchain systems once favored by business consortia, systems which weren’t really decentralized and added no real value as a result. Nowadays, with businesses increasingly building Web3 strategies on permissionless layer 1 protocols such as Ethereum, the retrograde connotation of “blockchain” may not be so bad.)\nImprecise language\nThe industry’s language problem goes beyond the negative connotations of “crypto.” It’s also that catchall words lack precision and vital nuance.\nFor example, there are multiple types of tokens. These include commodity tokens like ether (ETH) that power public blockchains; store-of-value assets such as bitcoin (BTC); payment tokens such as USDC; and NFTs, which are essentially markers of scarce digital objects. All are often lumped under the label “cryptocurrencies,” which fosters an association with the traditional idea of “currencies” and carries distinct legal and political connotations.\nRead more: What is Cryptocurrency?\nThis imprecision creates problems for participants in this industry when they negotiate over rules or terms of service with each other and with policymakers and non-crypto businesses.\n“Too often we’re talking past each other,” says David Treat, senior managing director of Accenture’s blockchain practice. “People apply an argument about one domain which doesn’t really work with all the others.”\nTreat is looking for a taxonomy framework that “allows us to see the interplay between the tokenization of identity, money and objects so that we don’t get sucked into one myopic facet of this and miss the wider, important conversation.”\nObsessing about words in this way might seem beside-the-point when the most important thing is to come up with protections against the kind of malfeasance that led to the FTX collapse. But amid reports that compliance officers are now giving banks blanket instructions to block services to any entity that’s touched” crypto” – if taken literally, a group that includes the likes of Microsoft, Starbucks and, ironically, BNY Mellon – it’s clear that we all need to get clearer with our words.\nRead more: CoinDesk's Crypto Glossary\nWho decides, though? This is not a central marketing department or chief brand officer that can dictate what brand labeling this industry should use. The market will decide which words to use.\nSo, for now, we’re stuck with “crypto.”",

    "content": "Blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developers continued to build out their ecosystems in 2022, even in the face of a brutal crypto winter, Electric Capital, a crypto venture capital firm, said in a new report.\nAmid a significant drop in crypto prices in 2022, there was an 8% increase in year-to-year growth in full-time developers that worked on different blockchain ecosystems, according to the VC firm’s 2022 Electric Capital Developer Report. Last year also saw an all-time high of roughly 61,000 developers that contributed code for the first time, across all ecosystems.\nMaria Shen, a partner at Electric Capital and the author of the study, told CoinDesk that the growth of developers in 2022 fell in line with similar patterns from previous bear market cycles, for example in 2018, full-time developers joined the industry to commit code to new ecosystems, despite all-time low cryptocurrency prices.\n“Every single time we have one of these [bear market] cycles, we actually have a step function increase in the number of developers,” Shen said. “They come in, and then they stick around, despite prices dropping, which is amazing,” she added.\nShen said alternative ecosystems to Bitcoin and Ethereum are growing fast, and will be worth keeping an eye on in 2023.\nIn fact, only 28% of developers in 2022 contributed code to the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems. Most developers worked on the other top 200 ecosystems. This means that most developers in the blockchain industry are working on building new emerging ecosystems that are not Ethereum and Bitcoin, even though the report shows that those two are the most mature ecosystems in the industry.\nSome of these ecosystems that seem to be drawing more attention are communities on the Solana, Polygon, Cosmos, and Polkadot blockchains. Each community grew their total developers respectively by 83%, 40%, 25%, and 2%, in 2022, according to the report.\nThe emergence of new ecosystems is a sign that developers are experimenting with new technologies and building environments that are becoming more important in the crypto industry. “I think it's really, really remarkable that seven years ago, we had 1,000 monthly active developers and then over the past two years, 100,000 new developers just decided to take their head in and write some code,” Shen shared. “This is becoming a very significant open source community.”\nRead more: Ethereum Far Outpaces Bitcoin in Developer Activity in 2020: Electric Capital Report",

    "summary": "During the coronavirus crisis, Handshake may be the leading free-speech-oriented crypto project. But is it just beginner’s luck?",
    "content": "The coronavirus crisis may have given one censorship-resistance project a small boost.\nThere are several startups trying to decentralize the internet’s domain-name infrastructure, including Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Unstoppable Domains. So far, ENS director of operations Brantly Millegan said the ENS ecosystem has roughly 30,000 Ethereum accounts that own .eth domains, a total of 350,000 unique web names. Unstoppable Domains co-founder Brad Kam said his project has 220,000 registered domains since January 2019, with 8,000 live websites.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nKam said Unstoppable domains generally sold to companies like MyCrypto and the Kyber Network for between $40 and $10,000 each, which even modest estimates indicate as income worth more than $8.8 million. This startup’s business model bets that crypto exchanges and wallets will need censorship-resistant domain options for regulatory arbitrage. Kam said he is passionate about freedom of speech and businesses being able to resist dictators.\nMeanwhile, the comparable and highly anticipated web domain project Handshake, which airdropped an estimated $100 million worth of HNS tokens to developers with active GitHub pages, has attracted thousands of participants since it launched in February 2020.\nRead more: Handshake Revealed: VCs Back Plan to Give Away $100 Million in Crypto\nTieshun Roquerre, CEO of the Handshake-centric Namebase exchange, said users traded $10 million worth of HNS tokens so far, while claiming web domainshttps://hnscan.com/charts through 80,000 auctions in four months. Community members estimate only a few million dollars worth of HNS was spent on domains – with most of that activity coming from people trading airdropped HNS for other assets like bitcoin.\nRoquerre estimated 4,373 people claimed their tokens out of roughly 150,000 eligible recipients, and “some of our users have reached out about coronavirus-related names.”\nAlthough this represents a small portion of the airdropped tokens, the domain name service (DNS) provider NextDNS also offers support for Handshake name resolution.\n“More people are using it than we thought, and from what we've seen a few cool handshake-only mini-sites are starting to pop up,” NextDNS CEO Romain Cointepas said.\nThis year the plan is for NextDNS to run its own HNS nodes, Cointepas said, comparable to running a Simplified Payment Verification bitcoin node. This would let customers use Handshake for top-level domains (TLDs) like .com and .net, “effectively replacing the root servers completely,” Cointepas said.\nSo far, this primarily appeals to developers with hobby projects who like the idea of completely owning their own website without trusting service providers. Beyond hobbyists, some crypto companies like Brave have claimed their corresponding Handshake web domains as well.\n“With Handshake you own it directly with a private key, the way you own bitcoin with a private key,” said HNS user Matthew Zipkin, who built the reference site easyhandshake.com. “As long as you keep that key secure, no one is taking that name from you. … There’s a lot of money and corruption and centralization. The namespace is dominated by ICANN.”\nMany believe the current system is relatively public and well-managed. The central body that governs domain space, ICANN, recently rejected an attempt to sell .org domains to the private firm Ethos Capital. Yet, Zipkin said ICANN’s dominance is still problematic because the organization is based in the United States and other tech organizations, like the Microsoft-owned GitHub, stopped offering full services in 2019 to some jurisdictions for fear of American sanctions.\nRead more: Planned $1.1B Sale of .Org Angers Many Open Source Crypto Developers\n“Handshake doesn’t replace DNS, it extends it,” Zipkin said. “When I’m using a Handshake resolver, that means my internet service provider (ISP) doesn’t know where I’m browsing because I’m not asking them. … Anyone can run a resolver on their computer. They can verify Handshake names trustlessly with minimal data downloads and bandwidth.”\nZipkin said Handshake can also be used with a privacy-enhancing Tor browser, in addition to regular VPN services. Yet some DNS veterans remain skeptical about the prospect that Handshake could achieve commercial traction, beyond hobbyists and crypto startups.\nToo fringe\nFarsight CEO Paul Vixie, who helped scale DNS and build the system we use today, said that “no one wants to splinter the namespace because that will fragment the market.”\nHe added at least a dozen startups have tried to achieve Handshake’s same goal – to decentralize DNS infrastructure options – but none have achieved both significant and sustainable traction. Plus, the Handshake community is already being faced with its first legal conundrum over whether it can offer “.music,” another version of which is run by ICANN.\nRead more: The Domain Startups Building an Uncensorable Internet on Top of Ethereum\n“The commercial community, outside of that [tech bubble] … they are happy with the namespace as is,” Vixie said. “There is no endgame for multiple namespaces. … You can certainly waste a lot of investor money but in the end there’s got to be one that works.”\nSpeaking to that point, Namebase’s Roquerre said he expects it will take a long time for developers to buy or trade TLDs for business, not pleasure.“In the long term there’s going to be more commercial activity,” Roquerre agreed. “I think the main theme of censorship resistance is generally why people are interested in Handshake, it’s been like that for a long time and it’s continuing.”\nUpdate (May 28, 20:11 UTC): The headline and body of this article have been edited to clarify there were reportedly $10 million worth of HNS trades on Namebase since the token launched, but only a fraction of those users bought domain names.",

    "title": "New York Lawyers Propose Toolkit for Keeping 'Decentralized' Blockchains Honest",
    "summary": "Ketsal's \"Open Standards\" rubric is the latest push to demystify network decentralization in the blockchain space.",
    "content": "A New York law firm is trying to test blockchain projects’ decentralization claims against their perhaps not-quite-so-distributed realities.\nCalled the “Ketsal Open Standards” rubric, the toolkit, developed by the Ketsal law firm and revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, proposes using hard, measurable data points to either bolster or burst a blockchain’s decentralized credentials.\nIt’s the latest contribution to a long-raging debate in crypto: when, and how, is something truly decentralized?\nFinding that key, said toolkit co-creator and Ketsal partner Josh Garcia, can help investors, security researchers and even securities regulators root out blockchain projects’ sometimes bogus claims.\n“It’s a tool to push along an informed discussion on what you’re talking about when you’re saying, ‘my network is decentralized.’\"\n\"Now you can push back” with evidence the assertion is demonstrably false, he said.\nGarcia and co-author Jenny Leung's Open Standards is hardly the first decentralization measurement toolkit. But a review by CoinDesk shows it to be one of the most robust.\nSee also: To Get Serious About Decentralization, We Need to Measure It\nThirty-three data points probe the hard facts behind blockchain decentralization. Many are obvious. For example, the focus network’s node count – a decentralized network should have plenty – and its underlying code’s licensure status – open source or bust – are clear benchmarks.\nBut others appear to be more novel. Ketsal’s framework proposes weighing the network’s GitHub statistics, measuring inter-node communication times, determining how large a stake of the cryptocurrency rests in wallets (and with the big-investing whales) – and even the theoretical cost of attacking the market price of a cryptocurrency, among others.\nCompiling these statistics can help researchers better understand a blockchain’s in-the-moment distribution even if reaching an up-down verdict on its decentralization is impossible, said Garcia.\n“It’s not an answer to the question, ‘What is decentralization,’ but it's a way to find that answer,” he said. “If people can decide whether or not some of these metrics are valid,” they can use their chosen set to test for the type of decentralization they’re looking at.\nProviding a broad selection of diverse metrics is critical, he said, because of the political, computational and economic analysts searching for a “decentralization” particular to them. A securities regulator concerned with the Howey Test would likely choose different data points than a security researcher probing the network for holes.\nRead more: Coinbase-Led Crypto Ratings Council Plans Transparency Boost as New Members Join\nBut different analysts also might hone in on similar points. For one, mining power concentration, or the concentration of miners whose computational efforts cryptographically secure proof-of-work blockchains, is a critical benchmark for any decentralization hawk.\nIf all the key miners are geographically concentrated or grouped into a single pool, a blockchain may face mounting centralization and security risks, according to Ketsal. Just four pools mined 58% of Bitcoin blocks in the past year, the rubric shows.\nGarcia said his team spent months compiling all the relevant data points from the world’s best-known blockchain network. Bitcoin’s resilience as well as the consensus agreement that it is decentralized make it an ideal case study, and Garcia said it’s the obvious benchmark to hold other projects against.\n“If you do the same exact chart for another blockchain network, and you compare it side by side to Bitcoin … you know how far off you are from [decentralization]” he said.\nRead the Open Standards whitepaper and rubric:",

    "content": "The U.S. Department of Defense can’t afford to lose the global military blockchain race to Russia and China, warns a new white paper by Amazon Web Services, IBM, Deloitte and others.\nOrganized by the Value Technology Foundation think tank and co-authored by a smattering of private sector tech companies, consultancies and blockchain firms, the briefing offers a sobering analysis of that race as it stands.\n“The two superpowers that pose the greatest threat to the U.S. are both heavily investing in both the research and development of blockchain technology,” the briefing said: China’s on the “economic warfare” offensive with its digital currency. Russia is on defense with a lab dedicated to blockchain cyber threat mitigation.\nThe U.S. needs to similarly bootstrap its blockchain and DLT warfighter readiness, and it stands to benefit as soon as it does, the briefing said. In addition to AWS, IBM and Deloitte, the paper was written by Accenture, CGI Federal, ConsenSys, SIMBA Chain and Colvin Run Networks.\nIn cybersecurity, blockchain could broadly assist the military in anything from “weapons release” to stopping data erasure, an impossible proposition for append only databases. But it could also bolster command and control mechanisms through multi-party authentication.\nIf multiple parties hold command authority, and they must reach consensus to act, then the system could be made more secure with blockchain, the group wrote. This could have specific benefits for the U.S. military’s newest branch: the Space Force.\nBlockchain could contribute to the Space Force by adding multi-factor authentication to satellite communication systems, the group wrote. Such systems are generally insecure, and according to the report they’ve been exploited or proven vulnerable before with issues that DLT could fix.\n“An attacker would need to gain control over an arbitrary number of user accounts and be able to use those accounts to perform actions on the blockchain in order to confirm an inappropriate command,” the report said.\nThey advocated for DLT in the military supply chain with the same logistics playbook that civilian blockchain boosters hawk: identifying counterfeit goods verification, tracing provenance, keeping the food supply safe during a recall, sourcing commodities. All have defense department applications, according to the report.\nBut the military supply chain has already begun implementing DLT. The report documented a handful of blockchain trials in defense aerospace, aircraft parts additive manufacturing and naval engineering contracts.\nRead more: US Navy Launches Blockchain Research in Mission to Improve Tracking System\nDefense bureaucrats stand to benefit from a blockchain-based procurement process, the group said. Smart contracts could record deals whose data is shared only among authorized parties, with everything visible to the Defense Department in real time.\nThis could add transparency and auditability to a gargantuan military-industrial procurement machine, which in 2018 admitted to losing hundreds of billions of dollars to contract fraud.\n“Just as the DoD found a way to build new applications and make distributed systems possible on the Internet, blockchain enables new capabilities by offering a layer of trust that the DoD can apply to improve its procurement process,” the report said.",

    "content": "Alchemy has built a new push notification system for blockchain developers.\nAnnounced Monday, Alchemy Notify is a product designed to enhance the user experience (UX) of various crypto platforms by providing real-time notifications for transactions and events.\nBlockchain UX often relies on constant attention from the user, which can be off-putting for those who want to engage in a seamless transaction process. Alchemy Notify is hoping to change that through push notifications to smart devices.\n\"Extremely simple and intuitive user experiences are crucial to the mass adoption of blockchain applications,\" said Alchemy CEO and co-founder Nikil Viswanathan. \"Alchemy Notify provides a key building block for a great user experience – notifications.\"\nIt functions by replacing the nodes businesses use to read and write on blockchains with more expedient and scalable infrastructure. It's meant to coexist alongside the developer platform, which offers tools for monitoring, alerting and debugging crypto software.\n\"Notify requires extremely technical and nuanced infrastructure to provide the notification capabilities to developers,\" Alchemy CTO and co-founder Joe Lau told CoinDesk via Telegram. \"Notify is powered by the Alchemy Platform, which took years of research and development to build.\"\nThe San Francisco-based firm raised $15 million late last year from Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Samsung, SignalFire and others.\n\"In order to bring blockchain to a billion people, we as a community need to focus on building products that are accessible to normal people,\" Lau added. \"Great user experience is an absolute must – users expect blockchain products to be at least as good as, if not better than, traditional web and mobile products.\"\nRead more: Torus Goes Blockchain-Agnostic With New DirectAuth Dapp Login Tool\nThat focus is why large names including Augur, 0x, CryptoKitties, Kyber and the Opera browser rely on Alchemy’s blockchain developer platform to solve their UX and design challenges.\nResearch conducted by Airship suggests push notifications can increase user retention by up to 820% compared to users who receive no push notifications. The data was collected via 63 million app users to determine how they interacted with their smart devices.\nAlchemy is betting this can apply to the blockchain ecosystem as well. Events and transactions – such as interest earned, timed events, contracts, token swaps and in-game actions – can be confusing to understand for new users.\n“Making it easier to build great user experiences is absolutely crucial for the success of the blockchain industry,\" said Pantera Capital's Paul Veradittakit. \"Alchemy's developer platform continually innovates on empowering developers with new building blocks. Notify will be a game changer for the industry. Just look at what notifications have done for the mobile app ecosystem.\"",

    "summary": "\"Let's start a positive epidemic,\" says the team behind the #SpreadLoveNotCorona app. \"The more people get infected, the more money goes to charity.\"",
    "content": "Until recently, Thomas Bohner was following all the familiar coronavirus procedures: work from home, social distance, worry about everything. Then, one night over after-work online drinks a couple of weeks ago, he started brainstorming with his team about how to raise money for the coronavirus support effort.\nBohner’s team at IntellectEU, a New York software startup, had the idea of a crowdfunding application for charity. They divided tasks among themselves and hacked it together in fewer than 10 days.\nThe result is the #SpreadLoveNotCorona web apphttps://spreadlovenotcorona.io/our-faq, which digitally replicates the spreading of a virus. But instead of spreading illness, it scales its impact by encouraging donations to the U.N.’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization. Donations are recorded and their impact tracked using blockchain technology.\nSee also: Open Source PPE: Decentralizing Face Mask Production\n“As a blockchain-focused company, we wanted to prove how quickly you can develop and deploy a blockchain-based application (in this case Corda),” Thomas Bohner, vice president of IntellectEU, told CoinDesk in an email.\nThe idea is fairly straightforward. You sign up to donate, create a username and then donate before sharing a link with others to encourage them to do the same. You can click here to view a full mock-up of the app, and click through it.\nThe giving started with “patient zero;” with “every infection, the tree branches out and becomes wider and deeper. In the context of our application this means more donations to charity, so the more the merrier,” writes Robbert Coeckelbergh in a Medium post about the app’s technological construct.\nOn a leaderboard on the app you can see how much specific usernames have raised, and who has gotten involved. The leaderboardhttps://spreadlovenotcorona.io/patjevincent is updated every five minutes; currently IntellectEU tops it, having raised over $400 and “infected” or involved 77 people.\nDonations are logged and verified on the Corda blockchain, increasing transparency in the donation process.\n“We store the proof-of-payment (without personally identifiable information), making it possible to go back in the chain and verify every and each donation,” Bohner said. “People can go back and check their impact of sharing their personal link. This query checks the blockchain and all donations linked to that ID. The immutability and audibility of the blockchain are key characteristics here.”\nSee also: Researchers Are Tapping Blockchain Tools in Fight Against Coronavirus\nThus far, the project has raised almost $3,000. The impact can be tracked on the app.\nBohner said the application was built to support COVID-19 but could be repurposed if nonprofits want to leverage it for another good cause such as local crowdfunding or tracking and tracing for medical supplies.\n“We believe blockchain as a disruptive technology definitely attracts more people to the application and brings trust in the payment flow,” he said. “Traceability and transparency are becoming more key in the charity industry and blockchain can help.”",

    "title": "Cambodia Plots a Dollar-Free Future With Blockchain-Based Payments: White Paper",
    "summary": "Cambodia's central bankers are riding their hopes of de-dollarization on a national payments blockchain: Project Bakong.",
    "content": "The National Bank of Cambodia revealed the technical details of its upcoming blockchain-based payments system dubbed ‘Project Bakong’ this week.\nThe central bank, which has been building Project Bakong since 2017, views its quasi-digital currency project as a high-tech revamp of the Khmer Riel, Cambodia’s official currency but hardly its de facto cash choice, as locals have favored the U.S. dollar for decades, according to the white paper published Thursday.\nThe central bank said Bakong will help challenge the dollar’s reign by inducing Cambodians to pay instead via QR codes and a mobile app, with a Hyperledger Iroha blockchain facilitating real-time fund transfers between e-wallets plugged into their bank accounts.\nThat permissioned blockchain will work between Bakong accounts and traditional accounts, record transactions on a distributed ledger, reach consensus via the block voting hash-based “Yet Another Consensus” algorithm, and process transactions in five seconds or less, according to the white paper.\n“Transaction throughput is between 1,000 and 2,000 transactions per second,” depending on tech specs, the central bank said in the white paper. “This suggests that there is potential for this project to scale.”\nWatch: Cambodia's Project Bakong and the Future of Payments\nThe bank said its system’s peer-to-peer nature removes the inefficiencies of centralized clearing house models without costing users anything to transact.\n“Since banks and individual users are now brought into one DLT platform both banks and users no longer face interconnectivity and interoperability problems,” the central bank said.\nQuasi-digital currency\nCambodian officials have been hesitant to label the fiat-backed Project Bakong a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the past, instead calling it a blockchain payments system. Users must load Riel into their Bakong accounts before they can transact with others. That's different from a natively digital CBDC.\nEven so, the white paper frames Bakong against the proliferation of CBDC projects in highly-developed countries around the world. But while the paper said such nations may turn to CBDC to address their population’s falling cash use rates, in developing countries – a category in which Cambodia may remain for decades – it said that CBDC can promote financial inclusion, improve inefficient payment systems and even reduce poverty by opening access.\n(Notably, the National Bank of Cambodia is one of the few central banks whose future-of-money initiative actually relies on a blockchain.)\nThe demographically young and increasingly tech-savvy population of Cambodia will likely boost Bakong adoption, according to the bank. Cambodians are increasingly porting their financial lives onto their phones: e-wallet accounts in the country climbed 64% in 2019 to a record 5.22 million, according to the paper.\nSee also: Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status\nMass adoption may also grant the central bank a greater degree of control over Cambodia’s monetary policy by breaking the dollar’s decade-long local hold. Bank officials are already moving to oust the U.S. dollar: Last month, the central bank announced plans to phase out $1, $2 and $5 banknotes by the end of August.\nIt is still unclear precisely when Project Bakong will fully launch. The white paper said “early 2020,” despite being published midway through the year.",

    "summary": "Welcome to the world of boomer DeFi.",
    "content": "Chief among EY blockchain lead Paul Brody’s predictions for 2021: Financial institutions will bring decentralized finance (DeFi) to a consumer audience.\n“If I had to make a bold prediction,” Brody told CoinDesk last week, “I think by the end of 2021 at least one major financial institution will up the game on everybody else by offering some form of consumer DeFi, accessible through their single transactional window to a large consumer base.”\nNEAR Launches Multichain Access\nBold indeed. Large institutions may be warming to digital assets but DeFi, the surging bricolage of crypto lending platforms (with a total value locked of over $25 billion), is not for the uninitiated.\nEY’s blockchain team is always talking to banks and enterprise players, said Brody, and large companies are seeing things like Square’s published bitcoin numbers for its Cash App (growing at 700% per annum), and they want a piece.\nBrody has gained kudos for his close attention to privacy tech like zero-knowledge proofs, and how such techniques can help bring public blockchains within the firewalls of big businesses. Most recently, Brody teamed with ConsenSys engineer John Wolpert to create the Baseline Protocol, an Ethereum-based reconciliation system for enterprise firms.\nAsked which large companies he sees launching consumer DeFi, Brody believes this will emerge via app services: the Robinhoods, PayPals and Publics of the world.\n“It's going to be one of the newer-generation app services that are busy integrating everything within a single transactional window, where you can buy crypto, you can have bank deposits, you can buy stocks, etc.,” Brody said.\nThat said, industrializing DeFi connectivity is not going to be a free-for-all, Brody added. “It will be a very carefully curated set of offerings, and firms will have to really think through how they explain and sell these things to the general public.”\nKey ingredients\nTwo major catalysts will help this DeFi conversion take place, according to Brody. Firstly, the testing, auditing and hardening of smart contracts; secondly, the inclusion of regulated stablecoins in the space.\n“Regulated stablecoins will make it a more mature sector for institutional investors and for the big money to come in,” said Brody. “And while some traders think the volatility of crypto is a feature, not a bug, the value proposition of DeFi isn't based on the volatility of crypto. It's based on the ability to put your money to work in an automated fashion.”\nA final piece of the institutional DeFi puzzle is the introduction of real-world assets into the on-chain space.\n“It can’t just be other virtual assets,” said Brody. “It must go beyond that, whether a piece of property or a stock that can be used in an automated DeFi ecosystem.”\nBringing real-world assets into DeFi is an alluring idea, but there are tricky questions around how to plug the on-chain world into the real world, how to settle disputes and so on.\n“This is where I have long believed there's an enormous role for independent third parties,” said Brody. “There is no algorithm or voting process, I believe, that you can use to do dispute resolution.”",

    "summary": "Bitmark's experience in Taiwan raises questions about censorship and access in the age of COVID-19.",
    "content": "The Taiwanese startup Bitmark, which participated in a government-sponsored hackathon in May, was unable to promote its blockchain solution due to Apple’s pandemic moderation policy.\n“We were trying to essentially build a weather forecast but for public health,” said Bitmark CEO Sean Moss-Pultz. “It allowed people to volunteer their symptoms and what they are trying to do to get better, and connect that to public data from public health offices.”\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nPrecisely because the World Health Organization excludes Taiwan, the small Asian nation has developed a unique set of software tools for combatting COVID-19. However, the Apple store only lists health apps published by government entities or nonprofits. This means the small nation’s startup community has limited access to mobile device users. (Apple did not respond to requests for comment by press time.)\nAccording to a report by the analytics and accelerator company AppWorks, there are now roughly 112 blockchain startups in Taiwan, including the supply chain management startup BSOS, which received an investment from Taiwan’s National Development Fund earlier this year.\nRead more: Austrian Government Funds Development of Blockchain-Based COVID-19 App\n“What are the next growth opportunities for blockchain? Everyone has different interpretations and expectations,” the AppWorks report said. “However, currently, conversations are mostly centered around the pandemic, with criticisms mainly targeted at the limitations and failures of centralization.”\nMoss-Pultz said his firm experienced those limitations firsthand. The mainstream app stores would only accept the resulting app, called Autonomy, if the Taiwanese government itself released the mobile app.\n“People all around the world are getting their apps blocked,” Moss-Pultz said. “We spent most of June trying to figure out what type of strategy we could have. … Most likely we’re just going to [release Autonomy] as a web thing.”\nIncentives\nApple and Google are hardly the only tech giants defining the public pandemic narratives. Amazon, for example, forced bitcoin advocate Knut Svanholm to remove a brief mention of the coronavirus from his self-published book in order to distribute it through Kindle in April.\nAs the Svanholm incident illustrated, moderating health tools during a pandemic without resulting in blunt-force censorship is a difficult task to automate.\nColin Steil, co-founder of the Taiwanese blockchain startup Cartesi, said tech companies “always have to proceed with caution” to avoid their software being “used to cause unrest or disrupt in political issues.”\nInternet giants can be accused of censorship regardless of whether they moderate content. Companies like Facebook and Twitter are both heavily criticized for rampant misinformation campaigns on their platforms, although they took radically different approaches to moderation. (Facebook has since recanted and said it will change its policies, due to public pressure.) Critics seem to consider the opposite of censorship to be, not digital anarchy, but consistently high-quality moderation.\nRead more: Social Media Bans ‘Highlight the Profound Censorship on Web 2.0’\nSteil said that compared to stringent but relatively healthy Taiwan, American leaders were “stalled for many reasons” in reacting to the pandemic and “reliant on tech companies” to offer solutions.\n“Taiwan took the pandemic very seriously due to its prior experience with viruses, and reacted in a method that used whatever tools and tech they had available,” Steil said, highlighting the contrast in public policies.\nBlockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen, who collaborated with Bitmark at the May hackathon and is an advocate for decentralized identity tech, said “good actors” at Silicon Valley’s tech giants are often “stymied” by company objectives.\nSo far, American tech companies dominate public services, sometimes even running servers for government agencies, he said, in ways other private companies cannot compete with.\n“Their strategies have been to vertically integrate and limit other people,” Allen said of companies like Google, Facebook and Apple. “I don’t think their intent is malicious in any fashion, but the nature of keeping competition out has a potential harm.”",

    "content": "Vitalik Buterin has called for lawmakers to be more accommodating to blockchain protocols, saying they can actually help antitrust agencies fight monopolies and anti-competitive behavior.\nTogether with Thibault Schrepel, an antitrust academic and Harvard faculty associate, the creator of Ethereum argued in a newly published paper that blockchain and antitrust agencies \"share a common goal\" in stopping the overt centralization of economic clout. In another word: decentralization.\nTitled: \"Blockchain Code as Antitrust,\" Buterin and Schrepel argue antitrust agencies promote decentralization by punishing anti-competitive behaviors to prevent \"harmful concentrations,\" similar to a blockchain that puts decentralization at its very core layer of functioning.\nSee also: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0\nBut on a more pragmatic level, the report argues that allowing blockchains to flourish will actually benefit antitrust agencies. As anyone can transact on them, irrespective of location, they can create fairer environments in places where there is either ineffective or non-existent antitrust enforcement.\nThe paper, published Monday, argues that in the short term antitrust agencies – which include bodies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the U.S. – should support initiatives such as sandboxes, sanctified spaces where blockchains can grow and function with less regulatory oversight.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Schrepel elaborated this could include \"not going after the potential anti-competitive practices of blockchains which are designed in a highly decentralized way\" as well as \"not regulating these blockchains too strictly (especially, not their key characteristics).\"\nSee also: The Netherlands’ AMLD5 Interpretation Appears to Be Killing Crypto Firms\nIn the long term, antitrust agencies could even try and help foster a new regulatory framework for the technology to operate within, including the legal sanctioning of things like sandboxes. The report says this could form part of a process of \"re-conceptualization\" where regulators are directed \"toward technological issues in exchange for not going after other anticompetitive practices.\"",

    "summary": "Blockchain technology is a powerful tool for broadcasting and recording information, Red Date's Yifan He says.",
    "content": "The names we have for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are entirely inappropriate. They describe ways to store data, which does not capture its function as a new way to transmit it. What makes blockchain so transformative is its data transmission protocol. It distributes data in a manner of “broadcasting,” as opposed to linear transmissions the vast majority of IT processes use.\nAt this time, cryptocurrencies happen to be the simplest and by far the most common use case for blockchain tech, but I have my eyes set on a future where blockchain innovates the internet as we know it.\nIn the early days of the internet, transferring data between individual computers was a manual process, often involving tapes, floppy disks or CDs. The basic premise was to transfer data within seconds, and linking all computers, everywhere, is what makes the “World Wide Web.”\nWe’ve all seen the changes this data transmission technology has brought to the world, but when the internet was first invented over half a century ago, information systems were in their early stages and business transactions relatively simple.\nWith today’s internet, if a business scenario involves multiple IT systems, data is transmitted between them one by one. The more systems there are, the more convoluted this linear process becomes; an early participant won’t know what happens with later participants and there are time lags between each party in receipt of the data. There is no easy way to counteract the possibility some or all of the data has been manipulated along the way.\nWhen you consider all of the privacy and security issues the internet has now in its current form, it can be seen as a legacy system in need of an upgrade. The basis of blockchain enables different computers to communicate seamlessly with multiple counterparts, and any data changes can be synced to all IT systems in real time. It really does not matter if you save the data into a block, ledger or even a traditional database.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that using blockchain tech for its broadcasting data transmission capability is the key to evolving the internet. Why, for instance, when we send an email, does it need to pass through and be stored in third-party servers on its way to the intended recipient? Why, when we visit a website, can’t we choose how personal data is shared with the host?\nTo help you understand the power of data broadcasting, here is an example: self-driving cars. In a linear transmission process, a self-driving car could only rely on each neighboring vehicle to share its current and intended movement data, which is a slow and inefficient process. Should the request for this information of each vehicle be exchanged and reacted upon via broadcasting data transmission, instantaneous synchronicity between all vehicles within a certain radius improves everyone’s experience.\nWith blockchain technology’s ability to transmit data through broadcasting, we can rebuild the internet to become more secure, more efficient and more privacy oriented, and we can evolve other IT processes to innovate 21st-century living. This is the motivation behind and vision we hold for BSN.\nWe simply are not in the business of working with speculative cryptocurrencies. Red Date will continue to invest in the research and development of blockchain’s underlying technology and the global infrastructure based upon it. While the possibilities for using blockchain tech are wide-ranging, not nearly enough industry professionals are leveraging the research and development needed for it to begin solving real-world problems. The sooner this changes, the sooner we all benefit.",

    "title": "From Enron to Wirecard: How Blockchain Tech Could Have Helped",
    "summary": "If blockchain technology is used within a regulated financial system, Wirecard-esque scandals can be a thing of the past, writes BRD CEO Adam Traidman.",
    "content": "Adam Traidman is CEO of BRD, a mobile cryptocurrency wallet.\nIf a global company can successfully hide billions of dollars overnight, we have a problem. If it is rigorously audited by a leading accounting firm and regulated by one of the most thorough regulatory agencies in the world, yet still manages to cover up the disappearance of billions of dollars, then we have an even bigger problem. I am of course talking about the glaring reports that thrust the balance sheets of German-based card issuer Wirecard into the spotlight in recent weeks, uncovering some ugly truths and a culture of mistruths pertaining to financial record-keeping.\nHow could a globally recognized company get away with $2.1 billion worth of fraud for so long? To put it bluntly, this is a case of a largely legitimate public-facing business fronting for shrewd money laundering operations. Hiding in plain sight, as it were.\nThe Wirecard scandal highlights how an optically upstanding and regulatory compliant company can divulge certain strands of information, while tactically omitting crucial details, allowing it to navigate tight regulatory and audit constraints. The fraud seems to have been enabled by an expansive network of subsidiaries, and a convoluted corporate structure.\nSee also: New Blockchain Tool Promises Verifiable Audits in 30 Seconds\nThe 2006 purchase of XCOM Bank AG broadened Wirecard’s remit considerably, making it eligible to issue credit cards, while also handling money on behalf of merchants, a spectrum of activity that traditionally blurs the line between non-banking and straightforward banking operations.\nBetween 2011 and 2014, Wirecard began purchasing a number of Asian payments companies, further adding layers of complexity to the company’s structure and balance sheet. The Financial Times honed in on this expansion, which continued throughout the decade, pointing to a number of inconsistencies in Wirecard’s accounts. Some of these subsidiaries were reportedly processing payments on behalf of the company, enabling Wirecard to tactfully construct a shield for suspicious accounting practices – including a $2 billion balance sheet hole.\nFast forward to 2020: An investigation by German and Singaporean regulators led authorities to two trust accounts in the Philippines, which supposedly held the missing money. The auditors, of course, were unable to find the cash.\nThe dubious findings led many to believe the company was inflating its value through simulating business with a number of third-party acquirers. A slightly divergent theory suggests that perhaps some of this “business” was legitimate, but it wasn’t necessarily being conducted on behalf of Wirecard, and the money was never held where it was supposed to be.\nBlockchain could have helped\nThe unraveling of Wirecard’s gross malpractice should be a watershed moment, one that initiates a technology-driven change to mitigate the risk of these kinds of scandals. Ideally, every time a firm tries to suppress fund details, they should pop up somewhere else, dissuading entities from engaging in the alteration of financial records.\nBlockchain technology enables real-time, cross-organizational intelligence sharing that can mitigate the risk of financial crimes flying under the radar. This is true also in cases where criminal networks are geographically distributed, with multiple banks being used to cover up illicit activity, as it was in the Wirecard case.\nSee also: Leah Callon-Butler – Is Crypto Fintech? It Depends Who You Ask\nAs criminal networks become increasingly sophisticated, blockchain technology can be leveraged to help regulators corroborate evidence across an expansive ecosystem. Cryptographically secure tools such as private set intersection, which allow parties to compare two or more data sets and identify matching elements without revealing any underlying information, can be used to help regulators identify instances of money laundering and other financial crime.\nWhile the Wirecard scandal illustrates the need for a higher level of disclosure, particularly to regulators, I’m not promoting the idea that everything needs to be accessible. Companies will always need a degree of privacy for regulatory or competitive reasons. We can strike the right balance by making major companies accountable for their actions, and do so in a more efficient way than any government or regulated body currently can, using blockchain technology and new cryptographic techniques that help flag spurious transactions.\nClearly, in the case of Lehman Brothers, Enron and now Wirecard, the relevant regulatory bodies failed in a very public manner and were left to pick up the pieces. Even though Wirecard was fully audited, the company’s multi-layered subsidiaries allowed them to muddle financial information and sidestep regulatory reprimands. At some point, either the auditors weren’t paid enough to keep digging, or they ended up taking information on faith.\nWhen everything is laid out on a public ledger, no matter how deep auditors need to excavate, the information is always accessible. With blockchain being deployed within the context of a regulated financial system, we can pivot towards more decentralized and transparent payment and accounting systems, sparing future regulatory blushes and dissuading corporate entities from cheating the system.",

    "content": "After facing a heavy load of transactions earlier this month, bitcoin's (BTC) network has returned to a more normal level, recent developments suggest.\nThe total amount of fees paid to miners was 80 BTC as of Tuesday, down from its 11-month high of 201 BTC on May 21, according to the data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. It was at 57 BTC on May 3.\nThe percentage of miner revenue from fees has also pulled back to 9.4% from the 28-month high of 21% registered on May 20.\n“The fall back in transaction fees are related to a normalized transaction activity and recent mining difficulty adjustment, which occurs around every two weeks,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies and founder of virtual currency platform Coincurve.\nUsers pay fees to miners for processing transactions on the blockchain. Miners also receive a fixed amount of BTC per block mined. That number halves every four years, most recently on May 11 of this year.\nSee also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops by 6% in First Adjustment After Halving\nTransaction fees are determined by the state of the network (how congested it is) and the size of the transaction.\nBitcoin’s block size is 1 MB, which means miners can process only 1 MB worth of transactions per block mined roughly every 10 minutes. If the number of transactions exceeds 1 MB, the network gets congested and miners prioritize transactions with higher fees.\nNetwork congestion, as represented by bitcoin’s memory pool or its collection of unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain, has been on a declining trend since topping out at the 28-month high of 267,608 on May 18 with a total block size of 78.5 MB, as per data source Bitcoin Visuals. As a result, transaction fees have come off highs seen on May 21.\nThe memory pool exploded at the end of April and remained congested for a few days after halving as the programmed supply cut revved up investor interest, leading to an increase in the number of transactions. “This forced users to increase their mining fee, so they can jump ahead in line to have their transactions confirmed quicker,” said Chen.\nBlock interval time drops\nThe recent decline in fees could also be associated with the downward adjustment in the mining difficulty and the resulting drop in block interval time.\nThe mining difficulty, a measure of how hard it is to mine blocks, was adjusted lower by 6% to 15.14 terahashes per second on May 20, as the hashrate, or the mining power dedicated to mine blocks fell following the halving.\nSee also: The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption\nThe seven-day rolling average of bitcoin’s hashrate fell from 120 exahashes per second (EH/s) on May 11 to 90 EH/s to May 23. Moreover, halving doubled the cost of mining, forcing inefficient miners to shut down operations.\nWhen that happens, the time taken to mine blocks and confirm transactions rises, putting upward pressure on prices. Hence, the difficulty is decreased, enticing miners back to the blockchain.\nWhile the seven-day average of hashrate is still hovering around 90 EH/s, the mean block interval fell to 11 minutes from the high of 14.3 minutes registered on May 17. The mean block time had jumped by nearly 150% immediately after halving, forcing miners to charge higher fees.",

    "summary": "Yes, the Twitter hack was basically a giant bitcoin scam. But the fallout is showing the world the strengths of cryptocurrency and decentralization.",
    "content": "Every year has a handful of days that you’ll never forget. Sometimes for great reasons, sometimes for awful ones, and sometimes because a level of noise and action coalesces into an awareness that something big has shifted.\nWednesday was one of those days, with the staccato of compromised Twitter accounts (including ours) escalating to reach prominent public figures including current and former heads of state. The scale of the hack was spectacular.\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.\nThe mainstream press called this a “bitcoin scam,” and to some extent it was – the hacker set up the typical ploy of promising to send back double whatever amount of bitcoin anyone sent to a certain wallet. It’s amazing that people fall for this.\nBut some people do – a total of $123,000 worth of BTC was sent in approximately 400 transactions in total (some may have been the hacker recycling coins to inflate the activity). There were 17 transactions sent, or more than $1,000. Glossing over the fact that this is an astonishingly small amount for the scale of the hack, some skeptics took the opportunity to remind everyone how bitcoin was a scammer’s paradise.\nClose the door\nSome commentators went as far as to call for the banning of bitcoin. “If bitcoin were illegal,” goes the reasoning, “this wouldn’t happen.” Of course, this brought out the defenders by the droves, who pointed out – among other compelling arguments – that making something illegal doesn’t stop it from happening; it often just makes it harder to monitor. And banning bitcoin would not stop its use nor eliminate its value.\nBut it did highlight a pervasive concern among many mainstream investors: a lack of regulatory clarity. Could the U.S. decide to outlaw bitcoin transactions within its jurisdiction? The very possibility is understandably enough to keep cautious investors away.\nTechnically, the U.S. could not ban bitcoin on a global scale – bitcoin lives on a distributed network that would continue to exist even if U.S.-based nodes shut off and U.S.-based users dropped out. One of the strengths of bitcoin is that it is out of the range of state actors.\nBut, realistically, making the holding or transacting of bitcoin illegal for U.S.-based entities and individuals would be a big shock to the price as its store of value narrative would take a significant hit.\nWhat’s more, the U.S. has considerable influence over the FATF, which sets anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing systems for the world’s banks and payments companies. The organization could be pressured to penalize governments that allow cryptocurrency services within their jurisdiction. Yet all of these concerns seem unfounded. Last week, the FATF announced its intention to step up crypto asset supervision with a view to building a global framework, which implies an interest in monitoring rather than stopping.\nAnd in the wake of the Twitter hack, the talk coming out of Washington is not about bitcoin. The concern is the centralization of platforms. Twitter is under scrutiny much more than bitcoin.\nIf regulators were going to jump on the \"ban bitcoin\" bandwagon given the media frenzy, now would be the time. That they have not done so is a strong sign of acceptance. True, there may yet be hiccups ahead in the road to systemic support – but so far, the concern is more about the vulnerabilities in centralized services.\nFurthermore, the amount of bitcoin involved in the scam is minuscule compared to what the take could have been, given the scale of the operation. Maybe the public is becoming more scam-savvy? And we should all be grateful that the hackers only wanted bitcoin, when you consider that they had control of the Twitter accounts of the likes of Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu, Barack Obama, Apple...\nThe lack of focus on bitcoin in Washington this week is a step forward, especially in the eyes of professional investors eager for greater regulatory clarity. If indeed bitcoin does weather this without louder calls for a clampdown, that is a strong sign that regulators acknowledge that bitcoin is here to stay.\nI see you\nAnother way in which the Twitter hack was positive for bitcoin is the spotlight shone on the forensic transparency of the network.\nWithin hours of the hack, blockchain analysts were already constructing profiles of the hacker’s history and tracking the movements of the ill-gotten funds.\nThe wallets in question may not have a name and address associated with them, but they are indelibly there for anyone to monitor, and transactions into and out of these wallets cannot be hidden nor undone. Digital fiat money transfers may have associated names and addresses, but movements are easier to obscure. And names and addresses can be faked.\nWhat’s more, the fact that anyone can access this data spreads the potential for useful information coming to light. While there may initially be different interpretations of the addresses and transfers, a consensus interpretation tends to emerge, which is likely to be a help to law enforcement. And forensic techniques are advancing, as is the diversity of approaches to blockchain data analysis. This should reassure regulators that bitcoin-related crime is not the threat to society some skeptics claim.\nThe bigger question\nIt is true that having bitcoin in mainstream headlines is good for its “brand recognition” – but, in this case, the association with scams is not in its favor. Yet while politicians do pay attention to what the media is saying, by next week the \"bitcoin scam\" headlines will have faded into the pixels of time, given the frenetic news cycle we live in.\nAnd the market itself does not seem worried – the bitcoin price barely budged in the aftermath of the news.\nThe lasting effect will be a deeper understanding for those willing to ask the right questions, not just about bitcoin’s seizure resistance but also about how one weak access point left so much power in a bad actor’s hands.\nThat is a third beneficial outcome that should strengthen interest in blockchain applications beyond crypto assets. Growing concern over centralized vulnerabilities in communication platforms is just the beginning. From there to worrying about vulnerabilities in the centralized financial systems on which our society runs is not that big a step.\nAnyone know what's going on yet?\nThis week exemplified the seesaw of good news swiftly followed by dampeners. Better-than-expected earnings were offset by forecast downgrades, which seem to be spooking investors. Vaccine optimism, buoyed by positive results from a few laboratories, yet again got tempered by vaccine realism, as even really good candidates could take years before they become widely available. And when it comes to the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases, positive news in some areas was offset by devastating news in others.\nThe S&P 500 is very close to having clawed back its losses for the year-to-date, and by the time you read this, might well have done so. It is 7% higher than this time last year. I’ve given up wondering what economic outlook it is discounting.\nBitcoin has had a lackluster performance so far this month, yet it continues to outperform other major indices and assets on a year-to-date basis. Its lack of volatility has traders champing at the bit, however, and the emotional tension of waiting for a breakout, any breakout, could soon start to impact trading patterns.\nCHAIN LINKS\nCrypto asset fund manager Grayscale Investments* released its Q2 report,https://grayscale.co/insights/grayscale-q2-2020-digital-asset-investment-report/ which revealed new investment of over $900 million over the quarter, its largest quarterly inflow to date, and 80% more than the previous quarterly high in Q1. TAKEAWAY: While the BTC price has been stagnant of late, it appreciated over 40% in Q2, largely as part of a broader market recovery from post-crash lows, but also perhaps partially because of growing institutional support. We don’t know, however, how much of the inflow is new investment and how much is recycled as qualified investors sell their holding in the market at a premium and buy back in at par. (*Grayscale is owned by DCG, also the parent of CoinDesk.)\nLex Sokolin, the CMO and Global Fintech Co-Head at Ethereum laboratory ConsenSys, published an analysis of the rumored upcoming listing of crypto exchange Coinbase. TAKEAWAY: The lack of available data at the current time is one major obstacle for analysts trying to get a feel for what a listing valuation could be, but Lex does an admirable job of scraping information from public sources. Yet even if/when listing documents are filed and more numbers become available, analysts will still have a hard time figuring this one out: what exactly is Coinbase? Is it an exchange? A bank? A custodian?\nCrypto data provider Coin Metrics has published a report on stablecoins that looks into their explosive growth: It took supply five years to reach $6 billion in March 2012, and only four months since then to double that. TAKEAWAY: The report takes a close look at pegs – not everyone realizes that dollar stablecoins are not always worth $1, and that the difference can exert a material influence on supply as issuers arbitrage profit opportunities.\nCrypto fund manager Arca reviewed its 2020 predictions from January, and updated them for the rest of the year. TAKEAWAY: The ones I found particularly interesting included the growth in non-crypto companies issuing crypto tokens, the rise of non-fungible tokens as an asset group and the growing influence of younger generations (I wrote more about this here).\nBitcoin miners sent less bitcoin to exchanges during the second quarter of 2020 than at any time over the past 12 months. TAKEAWAY: This can be taken as bullish (miners are choosing to hold onto their mined bitcoin because they believe the price will go up) or bearish (they would rather not sell into what they think will be a weak market). Either way, we should remember that newly mined bitcoins now account for a very small fraction of trading volume, so the influence of miners’ decisions is mitigated. Their actions are worth watching, however, as most have close relationships with OTC desks that move high volumes and have their ear to the ground.\nThe number of addresses holding a large number of bitcoins, known as “whale addresses,” has declined to a 14-month low. TAKEAWAY: As with the miner flows metric above, this can also be either bearish or bullish. It’s not positive news for the asset price outlook to see large holders reduce their stakes; but a broader distribution of ownership is better for price resilience.\nU.S.-based digital asset firm BitOoda published a report, together with the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, that shows 50% of bitcoin mining is in China, and 14% in the U.S. TAKEAWAY: Earlier estimates had put China’s market share at 65%, so if these figures are accurate, the bitcoin mining industry is becoming more decentralized and less dependent on China.\nCrypto financial app Abra has settled charges from the SEC and the CFTC relating to its offering of synthetic swaps to retail investors without registering or selling them on a recognized national exchange. Abra and its Philippines-based partner company Plutus will pay $300,000 in fines and do not have to acknowledge the accusations. TAKEAWAY: This is the long arm of the law in action. Abra limited its offering to non-U.S. investors, and moved most of its operations overseas. But the regulators determined that having an office in San Francisco from which the contracts were marketed and hedged, serving a handful of U.S. retail investors that got through the geofencing, and having marketed to retail investors in the early days of the contract, put Abra in violation of securities laws. In other words, it doesn’t matter where your main base is – if your activity touches U.S. citizens and/or U.S. soil, you fall under U.S. jurisdiction.\nOn a recent panel, Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), said the recent changes to the BitLicense law were being well received. TAKEAWAY: The original BitLicense, which emerged just over five years ago as a requirement for any crypto business wanting to operate in the state of New York, received significant criticism for its onerous application obligations and the high cost of compliance. Lacewell introduced some reforms to the regulation that aimed to lower the barriers and encourage more experimentation. It’s not surprising they are being well received, but it is good news to get the confirmation. Many crypto businesses chose to not do business in New York as a result of the original design, and the update does not mean they will come back. But Wall Street is one of the greatest financial centers in the world, and if crypto is going to run with the “big boys,” a presence at the heart of finance will be a step forward in the push to position crypto assets as a respectable investment for institutional portfolios.\nBitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin has revealed his work on a new smart-contract language for Bitcoin called Sapio, which he hopes will increase the “financial self-sovereignty” of users. TAKEAWAY: It’s worth keeping an eye on technological developments even in assets that, for many, are based on the store-of-value narrative. Enhanced smart contract ability will not only potentially lend application functionalities to Bitcoin, giving it a “residual value” and further likening it to gold (which, as well as an investment asset, is used in jewelry, technology, dentistry, etc.); it could also make it easier and/or safer to custody and exchange.\nBitGo will offer API support for the latest “Travel Rule” guidelines from the FATF that stipulate originators and beneficiaries of financial transactions over $1,000 be identified. TAKEAWAY: This was always going to be a difficult proposition with crypto assets, since identification of both ends of a transaction is often not possible, and goes against the integral idea that transfers can be decentralized and independent of a third party. The FATF’s reach is long, however, and non-compliance is likely to be costly for jurisdictions that cannot control crypto activity within their boundaries. Technological aids like BitGo’s API, provided by a firm with a long history of custodial services, are likely to calm fears of both regulators and clients. Plus, BitGo’s origin is as a custody technology provider – in 2013, it launched the first multi-sig wallet, a staple of custody technology today.\nAlso, Shyft Network this week announced that it is releasing its blockchain-based solution to help crypto companies comply with the FATF requirements. TAKEAWAY: Tools like this are trying to get ahead of what is going to be a significant problem: the security vulnerabilities inherent in the FATF's requirement to send sensitive financial information back and forth.\nThe crypto options market is growing fast, both in volumes and in number of platforms. Gate.io, a relatively small offshore exchange, has launched a new options trading feature, and Singapore-based exchange Huobi, which already offers futures and perpetual swaps, plans to do so later this year. TAKEAWAY: Growth in options is a sign of a maturing market, and a necessary step for greater institutional involvement. How long this growth will continue is an open question, especially given the declining volumes in crypto spot and futures markets.\nSwitzerland-based crypto custodian Metaco has closed a Series A round that was reportedly oversubscribed by a factor of two. Investors include Standard Chartered, smart-card and currency note printer Giesecke+Devrient, Zürcher Kantonalbank (the fourth-largest bank in Switzerland) and the country’s postal service Swiss Post. TAKEAWAY: That this was reportedly oversubscribed is a sign of growing interest in Europe in digital asset market infrastructure. Also, the mix and profile of the investors is intriguing.\nPodcast episodes worth listening to:",

    "title": "China's Blockchain Infrastructure to Extend Global Reach With Six Public Chains",
    "summary": "China’s blockchain infrastructure BSN will expand its global reach by integrating with six major public chains including Tezos, NEO, Cosmos’ Irisnet, Nervos, Ethereum and EOS. Developers using these blockchains will be able to run nodes and build dapps in the network.",
    "content": "The Takeaway:\nA blockchain infrastructure backed by the Chinese government will open its services to decentralized applications (dapp) developers on a global scale on August 10.\nThe move is part of China’s plan to be the one and only infrastructure provider for blockchain firms across the world. That effort resembles the country’s aggressive international expansion in other major emerging technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence.\nThis global expansion is notable, given that China’s attempts to lead in other technologies have been disrupted. The Trump administration issued a new rule in May to prevent Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei, a leader in 5G technology, and its suppliers from using U.S. technology and software. The U.K. has also barred Huawei from its 5G networks.\nYet, China’s global blockchain ambitions have been a smooth sail.\nThe global version of Blockchain-Based Services Network (BSN) has integrated its data centers with six major decentralized blockchains: Tezos, NEO, Nervos, Cosmos’ IRISnet, Ethereum and EOS. The developers on these public chains can run nodes and applications using data storage, bandwidth and other resources provided by BSN.\nThe public chains could benefit from BSN’s cheap services, interoperability with other Chinese enterprise blockchains and access to financial data from China UnionPay, which is otherwise difficult for foreign-based blockchain firms to obtain and process.\n“The move is a milestone as BSN is the first state-backed blockchain infrastructure that is reaching developer communities outside China by integrating with major public chains,” said Yifan He, CEO of Beijing Red Date Technology, one of the founding companies behind BSN.\nRead More: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption\nThe nationwide blockchain infrastructure project was launched in April. It is led by the State Information Center of China (SIC) and supported by state-owned tech conglomerates China Mobile and China UnionPay, and Red Date, which architects BSN’s technical framework.\nSIC is a public institution under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning agency in the Chinese government. The institution has been one of the principal architects behind China’s national information security policies, and monitors and processes macroeconomic data for policymakers.\nThe six blockchain projects are BSN’s first batch of decentralized public blockchains to run on the network across its three data centers in Paris, San Francisco and Hong Kong, He said.\n“We’ve taken a lot of thoughts about who would be the first public chains to be integrated,” He said. “Besides Ethereum and EOS we have disclosed in April, we decided to include another international public chain Tezos, and two prominent China-originated projects NEO and Nervos.”\nBSN aims to on-board more than 10 public chains by the end of this year based on their user bases, technical background and products, He said.\nCloud services for blockchain\nGuoning Lü, co-founder of Nervos, said BSN can support a tailored infrastructure service for blockchain developers, noting that projects need to be able to run nodes on such an infrastructure to operate.\n“Essentially, blockchain firms are using standardized internet services from BSN as opposed to adjusting their own technical frameworks to use such services,” Lü said.\nThe standardized development environment could save a lot of time and money for developers from building things from scratch, Lü said.\n“For example, validation nodes require a high level of security protection to prevent them from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (one of the most common cyber attacks that make a network unavailable to its users),” Harriet Cao, co-founder of IRISnet Foundation, said.\nBSN will hide the complexities of these security features in its operation support. In the future, a developer can use BSN to run a node like people use cloud services, and developers can just search the name of the blockchain and hold their private keys in order to build dapps or run a node, Cao said.\nDevelopers will enjoy free services on BSN if they have fewer than 2,000 daily connection requests to BSN’s nodes. Red Date Technology’s Yifan He claims that BSN will be much more cost-effective and stable than other networks for dapp developers.\nThere are free nodes for blockchain projects but they tend to be unstable and hard to trace once a dapp loses connections to the nodes. Many dapps buy services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and build their own nodes in the data centers.\nFor one single node on a network like Alibaba Cloud, developers would have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year plus the cost of human resources in order to maintain the node. In contrast, BSN will only charge several hundred dollars for the yearly resources and operational services needed to run nodes, He said.\nAPIs\nWhile there are only six public chains, users will have more than a dozen options to be connected with BSN’s nodes.\nAll six chains will have nodes assigned to their mainnet and testnet respectively, where developers can first run their applications on testnets and find potential problems to ensure a frictionless experience on their mainnets.\nWhile all the chains will be able to be connected to the nodes via their native application programming interfaces (API), Ethereum and EOS developers can opt for API services provided by a third-party blockchain middleware firm dfuse.\nFor Ethereum and EOS, there will be mainnet nodes, testnet nodes and dfuse nodes with their own special API infrastructure attached to the nodes.\n\"While dfuse could offer faster and more convenient connections with the nodes on BSN, we make sure the developers with privacy concerns can still opt for native APIs,” He said.\nRead More: How Chainlink and Cosmos Fit Into China’s Grand Blockchain Initiative\nDfuse, Founded in 2018, is a Montreal, Canada-based firm that started off by providing API services to EOS-based applications. It later branched out to projects on Ethereum.\n“One of the main reasons that BSN chose us is we are very scalable,” Alexandre Bourget, dfuse co-founder and chief technology officer, said. “dfuse has been built and stress-tested on public chains processing 5,000 sustained/10,000 burst transactions per second, and is ready to support the next 10x and 100x in industry growth.”\nThe firm has been funded by Multicoin Capital and Intel Capital, which is the investing arm of Intel Corporation.\nOne network, two systems\nDevelopers can build dapps on the six public chains in BSN’s global version. Domestic users in mainland China, however, only have access to enterprise blockchains due to Chinese government’s restrictions on decentralized public chains that tend to have tokens.\n“The Chinese government and regulators are very cautious about decentralized public chains and try not to get involved in anything related to a public blockchain,” Hongfei Da, founder of NEO, said. “It is interesting to see BSN, which has a clear commercial purpose and is backed by entities with government background, is supporting such projects.”\n“It is like ByteDance behind TikTok,” Da said. “The international version of the app does not necessarily comply with the Chinese regulation but the local regulations from the countries [where] it is used. BSN reflects a common pragmatic approach for Chinese companies to go global.”\nBSN can serve as a way for non-Chinese blockchain firms to tap into the Chinese blockchain community.\nDevelopers outside China can now use many major Chinese enterprise blockchains to build their dapps, such as Tencent’s consortium chain FISCO-BISCO used for its virtual bank WeBank, according to He.\n\"We’re thrilled for Tezos to join a cohort of public blockchains that will provide the base layer for companies and software developers building blockchain-based applications in China and globally,” Hubertus Thonhauser, chairman of the Tezos Foundation Council, said. “Participating in the BSN is a momentous step forward on the path to wide-scale institutional adoption for the Tezos project.\"",

    "summary": "Growing investor interest, central bank money printing and PayPal's entree helped push bitcoin prices above their previous December 2017 record.",
    "content": "Bitcoin surged Monday to a new all-time high price of $19,864, extending its year-to-date rise to an astounding 170% during a 2020 that has seen tumultuous swings in global markets.\nHere are five reasons why the oldest and largest cryptocurrency has pushed to new highs.\nInstitutional interest\nSome institutional investors are taking on bitcoin exposure, such as buying into the publicly traded Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to a Nov. 20 report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase. (Note: Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk.) Guggenheim, a money manager that oversees $233 billion for investors, said in regulatory filings its Macro Opportunities Fund might allocate up to 10% of net assets to GBTC, CoinDesk reported Nov. 28. As well, the outstanding number of bitcoin futures contracts is surging on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, seen as another sign that big investors are using commodities markets to speculate on the cryptocurrency’s price, according to the JPMorgan report.\nHedge fund managers have a long view\nWell-known hedge fund managers are increasingly calling bitcoin a long-term investment. Legendary managers, including Paul Tudor Jones II and Stanley Druckenmiller, have recently said the cryptocurrency’s price, as denominated in U.S. dollars, could rise as the Federal Reserve prints money to help finance the government’s coronavirus-related emergency stimulus bills. The central bank has thus far created more than $3 trillion of new money in 2020, or more than three quarters of the entire amount created during its prior 107-year history.\nAnalysts are positive\nWall Street analysts have made positive comments over the past few days. AllianceBernstein, a $631 billion money manager, published a report saying the post-pandemic economic environment could create a role for bitcoin in investors’ asset allocation, CoinDesk reported Monday. Inigo Fraser Jenkins, co-head of the portfolio strategy team at Bernstein Research, wrote that when it comes to a role in hedging against inflation, “the driver of bitcoin is similar to that as for gold.”\nThe PayPal effect\nPayPal (PYPL) is allowing customers – some 346 million active accounts – to buy bitcoin. The person-to-person payments network announced Oct. 21 it would let customers buy, sell and hold bitcoin. According to the company, the cryptocurrency will become a “funding source for purchases at its 26 million merchants worldwide.”\nOk on OKEx\nThe bitcoin market last week overcame a major source of concern – bitcoin outflows from one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, OKEx. Some traders and analysts had speculated the end of a five-week suspension of withdrawals might translate into liquidations that could put selling pressure on the bitcoin market. Data extracted from the cryptocurrency’s underlying blockchain network showed some 24,631 bitcoin, worth $500 million at current prices, flowed out of the exchange in the 24 hours after the suspension was lifted last week.\nBut bitcoin's price action shows the market shrugged off the news, along with other negative developments, such as rumors the U.S. Treasury Department might be considering onerous cryptocurrency regulations. Traders also appeared to ignore data showing some large bitcoin traders – known as “whales” – might be preparing to dump their holdings in response to the cryptocurrency's price rise.",

    "title": "IoT Startup Helium Floats New Hardware Device for Mining Its HNT Crypto Tokens",
    "summary": "Helium is hoping a new manufacturing deal with RAK Wireless will help the crypto-powered IoT network expand its reach.",
    "content": "Helium’s plan to create a decentralized wireless network may be about to gain altitude.\nThe company, which aims to create a token-powered wireless network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, announced Tuesday it’s no longer the sole manufacturer of Helium hotspots, which create the Helium network by mining the project’s HNT cryptocurrency.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nRAK Wireless, a China-based manufacturer of IoT hardware will begin selling a new, cheaper version of the hotspot, potentially giving the whole enterprise a lift.\nQuick refresher: Helium aims to create a new kind of wireless network, one that’s suited for data from low-power applications like tracking location, but also is completely separate and independent from existing telecom networks. While Helium maintains the network, it’s peer-to-peer, meaning it’s created by individuals owning and operating their own nodes.\nEnter the Helium hotspot. For over a year, individuals have been able to buy and deploy one of the bologna-sandwich-sized hotspots, which both acts as a node in the network (via low-bandwidth wireless tech called LongFi) and rewards the owner by mining HNT crypto tokens.\nRead more: Crypto-Powered IoT Networks Are on Their Way to Over 250 US Cities\nUntil now, the only way to get a hotspot was to buy one from Helium for $495 apiece. The RAK Hotspot Miner, available today in North America and coming “soon” to Europe and Asia, costs $249, or roughly half. It’ll be sold exclusively through Cal-Chip, an online vendor of IoT devices. The components are nearly identical to Helium’s model, according to the company, but RAK can offer a lower price since it can take advantage of economies of scale that Helium can’t.\n“This is the first of what we hope will be many third parties building compatible hardware,” Helium CEO Amir Haleem said in an interview. “It’s an enormous step for us because up until now, we’ve been the only manufacturer and we’ve been the bottleneck. We can’t be the only entity contributing to [the network], both from a price point of view but also it doesn’t speak well to the decentralization story.”\nHelium hardware\nThe buyers of Helium’s hotspots have typically been enthusiasts who see the value in a low-power network or companies that want to leverage the technology itself.\nA company that wants to use the network to, say, track the location of its rental scooters can exchange HNT for data credits, which Helium also manages, and have a fixed price in dollars. The more hotspots in an area, the better the tracking – which also would likely fuel demand for HNT, which was trading at $1.75 as of press time, according to Messari.\nYou can see where this is going. With the RAK Hotspot lowering the bar to entry, more Helium owners may start to purchase them just to mine the cryptocurrency. If that happens, and those people are spread out in enough different places, Helium’s dream of decentralized wireless (which it calls, with a straight face, “DeWi”) might start to solidify, turning all those hotspots into valuable investments.\n“Building wireless infrastructure this way and having access to the internet be decentralized and not controlled by one entity is a must-have step in the evolution of the internet,” said Haleem. The existing universe of low-power access points and gateways is, quite frankly, a clusterf**k. So it's great to have a third party start to get involved in the foundational infrastructure.”\nRead more: IoT App Nodle Moves From Stellar Blockchain to Polkadot\nHelium’s technology is promising, but far from ubiquitous. The company says it’s sold about 12,000 hotspots, although public network stats say only 8,641 are active. And while that still sounds like a lot, it takes between 100-200 hotspots to bring a single city “online.”\nA few well-known companies, including Lime and Salesforce, have used Helium’s tech, but it’s early days.\nIn short, Helium needs to rise a lot further to reach its decentralized wireless utopia in the clouds, and its bubble could pop anytime. But at least with RAK Wireless coming on board, the weight of that journey is a little lighter.",

    "content": "When India’s Supreme Court overturned the banking restrictions for crypto exchanges back in March, everything changed.\nSince then, Binance joined the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), which played a key role in overturning the ban, and noted explosive growth via WazirX, the Indian exchange Binance acquired in 2019. A WazirX spokesperson told CoinDesk the exchange saw 150% more signups in many Indian cities from February to May 2020, which boosted local trading volumes by 66%.\nWormhole’s W Token Has a 999% Weekly Return; Why VanEck Is Bullish on Ethereum Layer 2s\n“The Supreme Court's positive verdict has surely helped in creating positivity around crypto in India,” the spokesperson said.\nRead more: Binance Joins Indian Tech Association That Helped Overturn Crypto Banking Ban\nAs part of that broader sentiment shift, prominent Indian economist Subhash Chandra Garg argued a “digital rupee will replace physical paper rupee as currency.” As the former executive director of the World Bank and former Indian finance secretary, Garg argued both that bitcoin is a global currency and that India should create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that citizens can use with “digital wallets.”\nEven beyond India, entrepreneurs like London-based Pavel Matveev of Wirex Ltd. are eager to expand in India.\n“Last November we launched our product in eight countries across Southeast Asia, and we are hoping to launch in India this summer,” Matveev said in a phone interview. “The United Kingdom for example has a huge remittance flow from the U.K. to India. … [Indian demand for crypto] may be exhilarated by the COVID-19 situation.”\nRead more: The Big Thing Holding Back India’s Crypto Boom\nBeyond boosting exchanges and remittances, Matic Network co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said there’s been an uptick in the usage of decentralized applications (dapps). Within the first month of rolling out an Ethereum scaling solution, Nailwal said his startup garnered roughly 60 dapps and is currently in the process of onboarding another 60.\n“Especially with crypto, people are able to play games and earn money out of it. Real money games are becoming more popular,” he said during a video call. “We’re seeing a lot of applications [rely on us] because Ethereum is completely choked up.”\nNailwal added there are more tech workers in India, with more than 1 billion people, than the entire populations of some countries. Especially in tech hubs like Bangalore, there are plenty of technically skilled people willing to overcome the UX challenges that hinder “mainstream” users. So far at least 15 of the dapps using Matic also hail from India, Nailwal said.\nThis may be the summer of Ethereum in India.\nIndia crypto revival\n“You will start seeing a large number of Indian applications being used, proportionately,” Nailwal said about the rise of “India’s Silicon Valley,” Bangalore.\nWhile government blockchain projects explore issues like food distribution, Nailwal said he is participating in a monthlong ETHIndia virtual hackathon, along with a few hundred developers. The ETHIndia Community Telegram group has roughly 931 members.\nPlus, the Trump administration’s hostile approach to foreign worker visas may inspire some Indian workers to build their careers in India’s tech industry instead. As the global recession worsens, India is now home to millions of people with diaspora connections and the computer skills to use cryptocurrency.\nUnocoin exchange co-founder Sunny Ray said, now that a few of the Indian industry’s major legal battles were won in court, exchanges are coming “back from the dead.”\nRead more: Indian Police Seize ATM Run By Crypto Exchange Unocoin\n“Banking is back, the company is profitable again in less than two months, we’re hiring people back,” Ray said about Unocoin reopening and serving “thousands” of active monthly users again. In total, the exchange has roughly 400,000 users that completed the know-your-customer process. Now Indian traders are barely getting started. The local market is slowly ramping up.\nUnocoin co-founder Sathvik Vishwanath said the broader economic crisis has reduced expendable income and made Indians more conservative as unemployment spreads. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the unemployment rate last month was over 22%. Instead of pre-coiners flocking to crypto, Vishwanath expects this crisis could have a delayed impact of inspiring more crypto-novices and day traders that start treating crypto as an investment.\nQuiet bulls\nTech-savvy users may increase their crypto holdings, Vishwanath said, because any Indian household with expendable wealth is now thinking about diversification.\nKashif Raza, a co-founder of the Indian news startup Crypto Kanoon, said, “People are finding crypto as an attractive proposition for hedging their risks, but still it is a long way [to go].” In the meantime, gold is often seen as the best way for Indian families to custody their own wealth. Indeed, the Indian gold market is booming and prices reached record highs in June.\nRead more: Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not Bitcoin\n“One thing is clear post-COVID-19, that in both [urban and rural communities] gold is a perfect hedge during the crisis. The gold price has risen exponentially,” Raza said in an email. “There are many exchanges that have observed a spike in new registrations on their platform during the lockdown in India.”\nBTC and ETH surge\nSo far, Raza said, Indians staying indoors are online searching for “new avenues of investment,” then finding crypto after gold. Indeed, Ashish Singhal, the Bangalore-based CEO of both the crypto wallet CRUXPay and the exchange Coinswitch.co, said he’s up to a total of 25,000 users since the coronavirus crisis began. More than half of the Indian users are women, he said.\n“The main cryptocurrencies are bitcoin and ether,” Singhal said during a call. “Exchanges like us need to do a big push to educate users. … A lot of people still believe cryptocurrency is banned in India.”\nWomen from India, who generally own gold jewelry as part of their wealth, are more likely to work in the tech industry than women from the United Kingdom or the United States. Across genders, Singhal said he’s seen a lot of enthusiasm, participation and “activities” around Ethereum.\n“Ethereum has its limits, but it’s an open platform to experiment,” Singhal said. “India is a very important market. Everyone understands that. We just need regulations to protect users, which will spark innovation.”",

    "content": "Bitcoin’s price rally in the days leading up to Coinbase’s hotly anticipated debut on the Nasdaq this week was largely driven by retail traders eager to get in on the action while whales were happy to take their money and swim away, blockchain data shows.\nThe number of unique addresses holding at least 0.01 coins rose from 8.96 million to over 9 million in the five days to April 14, alongside bitcoin's ascent from $59,000 to a record high of $64,801.79, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The count of addresses with non-zero balance and ones holding least 0.1 coins also rose in tandem with the price.\nMeanwhile, those with a minimum balance of 1,000 BTC – also known as the \"Rich List\" – dropped from 2,240 to 2,228. The tally of \"whole coiners,\" or addresses with a minimum balance of one coin, fell amid the price rise.\n\"The pre-Coinbase IPO rally was driven by retail investors, in mass,\" Flex Yang, CEO of Hong Kong-based Babel Finance, said in an email. \"We saw that the continuing decline of whales on the network further indicated that the decentralization of the Bitcoin network was really taking place.\"\nSome readers may argue that the diverging trends in the growth of small and large balance addresses may mearly represent the trend of whales holding coins in several addresses to mitigate hacking risks. A single user can store coins in multiple addresses. Similarly, exchange addresses have coins belonging to more than one individual.\nHowever, Glassnode's whale entities metric, which clusters crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin to provide a more precise estimate of the actual number of holders, also points to continued liquidation by large traders during the cryptocurrency's move to record highs.\nThe number of whale entities fell to a 3.5-month low of 2,228 on April 14. The metric decoupled from the rising price in February and dropped by 10% to 2,232 seen in the seven weeks to March 31.\nIt shows retail investors' high level of engagement began in the first quarter and continues to the present.\nSome observers, however, say these charts do not provide sufficient information, leaving the doors open for guesswork.\n\"The whale entities chart could show that smaller retail investors are purchasing bitcoin, and large holders are selling into that rally,\" Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Panxora, told CoinDesk in LinkedIn chat. \"It could also be showing that a smaller number of large investors is buying bitcoin, so the large entities' concentration is increasing.\"\nAccording to Smith, the latter is the case. \"We are seeing some very large investors moving into the market, and their assets are concentrated in a small number of fund and custodial accounts. Retail involvement has been lower this cycle than in 2017,\" Smith said.\nAlso read: Week in Review: Turkey’s Crypto Payments Ban, Morgan Stanley, Coinbase, Markets Check and More\nWhatever the case, the path of least resistance for bitcoin remains on the higher side, as the \"suits [institutions] are here to stay,\" as CoinDesk's research analysts noted in the first quarter review. Options traders continue to accumulate the $80,000 call option in a sign of strengthening bullish conviction on the top cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin is trading near $61,000 at press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data.",

    "content": "The leading blockchain industry body in Australia has ejected retail-focused cryptocurrency project Qoin from its membership list, but it's not clear why.\nAccording to a Feb. 19 notice from Blockchain Australia (BCA), it issued a summons to Qoin on Jan. 29, asking Qoin to respond.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nBCA said that, after reviewing Qoin's response and the \"circumstances of the matter,\" it terminated the project's membership, meaning that Qoin must cease using of the Blockchain Australia logo and name in connection with its business or promotional activities.\nBCA aims to \"advance the adoption of blockchain technology throughout Australia,\" according to its website. It also provides members operating in the local industry an air of legitimacy.\nWhen asked for specific reasons behind BCA's decision to remove its membership, Qoin chief marketing officer Andrew Barker told CoinDesk the firm had not received \"any extra documentation pinpointing any example.\"\nA \"formal\" public response to the notice posted Wednesday by Qoin, though, alleges the notice from BCA included \"false allegations\" around \"communication and disclosures\" on the project's website.\n\"The timing ... aligns with the emergence of false and misleading comments ... made by certain antagonists on social media platforms including a previous board member,\" Qoin said in the post.\nSome reports have suggested that the former BCA board member is Nuggets News CEO Alex Saunders, who alleged in a tweet that Qoin is the \"biggest crypto scam\" in Australia two days before BCA's notice was served.\nBarker said that, while \"some have drawn that conclusion,\" because of the timing of the notice and because of Saunders' prior role, Qoin did not know that \"as a fact.\"\n\"We considered this notice a premeditated attack against Qoin,\" the project alleged in its post. It also claimed that during the period of its response and the final notice \"no questions were raised\" nor \"updates given\" by BCA.\nBarker further alleged BCA had chosen to edit out three lines of the document that was forwarded to Qoin in the notice that was made public. He would not disclose the lines, saying the BCA should provide them.\nSee also: Australia’s Blockchain Ecosystem Needs More Support From Regulators, Says Industry Body\nQoin said it will \"vigorously\" defend any statements and actions made by outside parties that it considers \"factually incorrect, slanderous and defamatory\" to its brand.

    "title": "Inside China's Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption",
    "summary": "China is about to launch its national blockchain platform, part of Beijing’s grand strategy to lead the digital transformation of the world economy.",
    "content": "China is about to launch its national blockchain platform, part of the country’s grand strategy to lead the digital transformation of the world economy.\nLed by the State Information Center, the Blockchain Service Network (BSN) is poised to launch for domestic commercial use Wednesday and globally on April 25. If it works as envisioned, companies and software developers will be able to plug into the BSN and build blockchain-based applications as easily as assembling Lego sets.\nBut the ultimate goal may go well beyond technical support for coders.\n“As the BSN takes hold in worldwide countries, it will become the only global infrastructure network that is innovated by China, whose gateway access is controlled by China,” declares the latest white paper penned by the BSN Alliance, led by the government agency, several state-owned entities and blockchain firms.\nAs such, the project has geopolitical and macroeconomic implications.\n“The move is very much like the ‘One Belt One Road Initiative’ in which China provides other countries with infrastructure and gains some first-mover advantage,” said James Cooper, a law professor and director of international legal studies at California Western School of Law.\nThe project also reminds Cooper of \"Made in China 2025,\" a nationwide initiative to spearhead innovation in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence, he said. The subtext is a desire to overcome China’s image as a copycat, reverse-engineering innovations from elsewhere.\nIn the October announcement of the BSN's internal testing, the Chinese government envisioned a variety of use cases. These included smart city applications, which use sensors connected to the internet to collect data and glean insights for managing public resources; in particular, the alliance mentioned energy conservation. It also listed identity registration and data storage as opportunities for BSN.\n“China has the ambition to be the technology leader in the world. And I think they might have enough technology chops to pull this off, at least within the blockchain industry,” said Edith Yeung, managing partner at blockchain-focused venture capital firm Proof of Capital.\nRead more: From Banking Giants to Tech Darlings, China Reveals Over 500 Enterprise Blockchain Projects\nSeveral signs indicate China has been building to this moment.\n“China files the most blockchain patents in the world,“ Yeung said. “They got the most important infrastructure companies on board: banks, telecom and internet giants.”\nPart of the network’s mission, once it is proven to be efficient and scalable in China, is to go abroad. Hong Kong and Singapore are among the 56 cities where the alliance is testing the network first.\n“We have already deployed some international nodes in other countries, such as the U.S, Japan, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and France,” Leon Li, CEO of crypto exchange operator Huobi Group, said through a spokesperson. His Singapore-based company’s blockchain development arm is a founding member of BSN.\nOther countries will have incentives to join the network, Yeung said, pointing to the BSN’s business-friendly priorities.\n“They get the selling point for enterprises right in their white paper,” she said. “For anyone to come on board, it needs to be low-cost, fast deployment and easy to manage.”\nWhat is the BSN?\nThe initiative – which is rolling out next week after a six-month internal test – is led by the State Information Center, a government agency under the National Development and Reform Commission, as well as state-owned telecommunication giants including China Telecom, China Unicom and payments firm China Union Pay.\nBut the BSN itself is not a blockchain protocol. Rather, it’s a centralized platform that has done the heavy lifting for developers so they can plug in and code, choosing from several enterprise blockchain protocols or public chains. The goal is to reduce their operational costs, improve flexibility and provide better regulatory oversight, according to the white paper.\n“Designed to unify the fragmented market, BSN is a cross-cloud, cross-portal and cross-framework public network that enables developers to easily and affordably develop, deploy, operate and maintain permissioned ... and permissionless blockchain applications and nodes,” Li said.\nDuring the beta testing period that began on Oct. 15 of last year and ends Wednesday, more than 2,000 participants signed up. A third of them are enterprises while the rest are individual developers, Li said.\nOne of the network’s advantages for BSN is its low price, which makes it accessible to a wider range of users compared to some of its prospective competitors, according to Li.\n“Deploying [distributed ledger technology] applications on major cloud services such as Ali Cloud and Huawei Cloud can cost developers tens of thousands of dollars per year,” he said. “To make it less cost-prohibitive for developers to deploy DLT applications, the minimal cost on BSN is only $300 per year.”\nRead more: Fintech Firm Joins Chinese Conglomerate to Build Blockchain Platform\nThe low price will encourage a vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises and individuals, including students, to use the BSN to invent and innovate, thereby accelerating the rapid development and widespread use of blockchain technology, Li said.\nAccording to the white paper, there are two main parts to laying the groundwork. The first is deploying the so-called public city nodes, essentially data centers or cloud computing resources dedicated in certain cities to processing transactions.\nThe white paper boasts that the BSN has signed up 100 city nodes via its telecom members and is hoping to deploy up to 200 more by the end of this year.\nThe second part is the configuration and modification of several enterprise blockchain protocols to fit uniform standards, in areas such as cryptography and software development kits (SDKs), so these systems can work in conjunction with each other.\nSo far, the BSN has configured and added several permissioned blockchain protocols to its pool including Hyperledger Fabric, the open-source software Walmart uses to track food along its supply chains. The network has done the same for China’s home-grown protocols such as internet giant Baidu’s Xuper Chain, and FISCO, developed by a consortium of China’s Shenzhen government agencies and local tech companies including Tencent, WeBank and Huawei.\nMost recently, CITA, the enterprise blockchain project initiated by developers at Cryptape, who backed the development of Nervos public chain, has also been added to the BSN.\nOnce authorized by the alliance and given a standardized SDK, developers will be able to choose a protocol and rent computing resources in locations they need to deploy a blockchain application. Because the permissioned protocols are adapted to support interoperability, developers will have more flexibility to switch from one to the other, the whitepaper said.\nThe top-down approach enables China to build a large-scale network quickly while avoiding regulatory red tape, Cooper said. “China has a national strategy.”\nPublic chains\nIn an initial BSN white paper published last year, the alliance only mentioned support for Hyperledger Fabric, the permissioned blockchain initiated by the Linux Foundation with contributions from tech giants including IBM.\nUnlike the public blockchains underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which anyone with an internet connection can download and run, permissioned systems can only be used by approved parties.\nBut the latest version of the white paper said it’s also including other permissioned blockchain frameworks. More surprisingly, it specifies the BSN will incorporate two public protocols: Ethereum and EOS.\nThere are a few reasons why the Chinese government is wary of open networks. Numerous scammers in the country lacking any technical foundations have used “community-driven” public chain projects to raise money from investors via initial coin offerings (ICO).\nEven public chains with legitimate technology pose risks, as the Chinese government sees it. If widely adopted as currency, digital tokens could undermine the Chinese central bank’s monetary sovereignty, for instance.\nStill, while the Chinese government has predominantly focused its resources on private blockchain projects, it has been engaging in public blockchain projects cautiously and discreetly.\nThe Shanghai government, for example, announced it would write grants and set up a research institute for Conflux, a public chain project founded by a group of top Chinese engineers.\nChina Merchants Bank International (CMBI), whose major shareholders include entities partly or fully owned by the state, is working with Nervos, a public permissionless network, to develop blockchain-based financial applications.\nThe logic behind the government’s (limited) involvement with public chains is that China needs to understand the technology, and it could have its own Ethereum-like networks if such systems succeed, said Omer Ozden, chairman of RockTree Capital.\nYeung said the Chinese government is surprisingly savvy about grassroots developer communication.\n“If you look at their website and WeChat channel, they are now hosting their second developer competition,” she said.\nAccording to Li, BSN doesn’t support public chains in China, but it will support Ethereum and EOS nodes outside China after the international beta testing phase ends in July.\nBig Brother?\nSuch a change attests to China’s complicated relationship with public blockchains.\nSuch networks underpin major cryptocurrency assets that are seen by the authorities as a source of speculation and systemic risk. But they arguably inspired the country’s pursuit of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nIn the early days of its CBDC development, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) considered distributed ledger technology but has pivoted to exploring a sort of middle ground between decentralization and centralization.\n“China is doing what they say they would do,” Yeung said. “Their virtual currency may be rolled out within a year. And they are doing it, at least the infrastructure piece, even with everyone locked up during COVID time for the past 90 days.”\nThe BSN white paper spells out the thinking of the state-sponsored group that the “complete decentralization” and “libertarian” nature of public blockchains make them ungovernable.\n“Many countries are able to formulate their own regulatory policies in relation to the Libra consortium blockchain founded by Facebook but are powerless over the permissionless blockchain framework of bitcoin,” the white paper said.\nTherefore, even though the BSN will support Ethereum and EOS, “it is not allowed to deploy and operate public blockchain nodes on BSN portals and city nodes that are within China.”\nThe logic behind the digital yuan and BSN could be that China has to study these technologies to prevent a company like Facebook or another country from gaining a monopoly on digital currency, Cooper said.\n“I think the irony is that a highly centralized system is embracing a distributed ledger or a decentralized technology,” he said.\nAs China aims to expand its network of its city nodes worldwide to create a global infrastructure, it’s unclear how well it will be received if the state controls the access points.\nA recent article in engineering publication IEEE Spectrum suggested BSN’s global partners, such as overseas developers or data center providers, may balk since holding the BSN’s root key – a unique passcode that’s generated to secure server interaction with a network – would allow the State Information Center to view transactions made on the platform.\nThe white paper did not specify whether the authority could monitor transactions, only that transactions made within an application will be kept private from each other.\nHowever, Yeung believes the Chinese government wants to be able to track everything with the network.\n“There is nothing decentralized about BSN,” she said, arguing the setup will help the government to fight fraud.\n“If the government has access to everything via handpicked nodes, everything is developed and maintained by the government, no more cash,” Yeung said. ”It's hard to have any fraud if all telco, banks, transportation, Alipay or WeChat is part of the government network.”",

    "summary": "Ethereum startup Magic just raised $4 million from investors like Naval Ravikant, SV Angel, Placeholder and Volt Capital to make passwords less of a pain.",
    "content": "The blockchain industry desperately needs password solutions that aren’t such a royal pain in the neck.\nThat’s why the San Francisco-based startup Magic just raised a $4 million seed round from investors like Naval Ravikant, SV Angel, Placeholder, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Volt Capital, just to name a few. SV Angel in particular has a complementary portfolio, including Coinbase, Stripe, Airbnb and Doordash.\nWormhole’s W Token Has a 999% Weekly Return; Why VanEck Is Bullish on Ethereum Layer 2s\n\"Magic points the way towards a world in which user identity and authentication is decentralized and not subject to control by the tech giants,” Ravikant said in a press statement.\nPlus, Magic CEO Sean Li said his startup already works with some decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and RadarRelay. As such, Chicago DeFi Alliance member Volt Capital also represents a strategic pairing. After all, DeFi’s biggest onboarding challenge is the user experience, not any lack of demand for low-barrier loans and global currencies.\nRead more: Chicago’s Trading Firms Look to DeFi With New ‘Alliance’\nVolt Capital partner Imran Khan said Magic’s delegated key management service lets app developers create custom sign-on experiences without touching the user's private keys.\n“I think the recession will increase their business,” Khan said. “Startups are going to look to be more efficient. They’ll use platforms like Magic to cut costs.”\nMost importantly, Khan added, Magic serves clientele beyond the crypto industry because it can authenticate based on whatever protocol the platform is using. Placeholder Capital co-founder Joel Monegro agreed, adding that enterprises are also looking for secure ways to grant employees remote access to permissioned networks.\n“That might be a way we see more adoption in an enterprise context,” Monegro said. “It’s bridging the gap between the traditional web authentication paradigms and the crypto authentication paradigms.”\nAny company with a login and a website could use Magic as a door without needing to rebuild a customized onboarding solution in front of the house, so to speak. Monegro said, at the end of the day, authentication is all about making “key management” approachable.\n“This is a way for users to not have to give up their data,” Khan added. “Magic is using blockchain as a backend infrastructure, in a way that any platform can easily integrate.”\nSimplifying keys\nStepping back, private keys are basically really long and complicated passwords that users can’t reset.\nMost internet users opt to trust platforms like Facebook in exchange for the convenience of a simplified username and password, plus the option of recourse if the password is forgotten, rather than retain full control over the asset or profile information.\nRead more: Torus Launches to Bring One-Click Login to Web 3.0\n“The key represents the singular piece of identity. You can use it in conjunction with 3Box to manage the data associated with that identity,” Li said, referring to the ConsenSys-backed startup 3Box. “We’re going to be working together on this authentication product.”\nMagic is also aiming to serve developers, especially decentralized application (dapp) makers from the ethereum community. Li estimated 5,000 developers and teams are currently using the tool, including Democracy Earth and TokenSets.\n“We can manage keys within the browser without having to rely on Chrome extensions,” Li said, offering the example of a shopper. “The private key never passes through the Magic backend and goes straight to Amazon.”\nHe said this early-stage startup is still on track to make more than $500,000 in revenue this year, despite the recession. And with the customer-facing sector of the industry saturated in wallets, service providers and apps, Li is betting instead on selling to the businesses that already have users rather than needing to attract a massive audience to turn a profit.\n“I think only a few niche things will eventually explode,” Li said. “The majority of [crypto] adoption will happen with mainstream companies gaining access to crypto applications.”",

    "summary": "U.S.-China tensions are taking a toll on venture funds that invest in non-crypto startups. Investment in the blockchain industry may be less affected.",
    "content": "With U.S.-China tensions continuing to burn, some investors are feeling the heat.\nFriction between the world’s two largest economies has taken a toll on venture funds investing in non-crypto startups. Investment in the blockchain industry, however, may be less affected. Crypto companies’ unique fundraising processes and decentralized nature provide some protection from geopolitical risks, according to China-focused crypto and blockchain investors.\nThe Trump administration recently sanctioned Chinese officials because of Hong Kong’s new security law. Separately, the U.S. warned the global community against using Chinese technology and tried to force Chinese companies to sell parts of their business. Other western countries are beginning to follow suit. China has kicked out major American media outlets and closed the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu.\nChina-focused venture funds have seen low capital inflow due to investment restrictions on U.S. pension funds, while Chinese companies will have to go through a more rigorous vetting process if they wish to go public on Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. This tightening comes on top of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already taken a toll on cross-border investment.\nSix U.S.-dollar funds with investments in China have looked to raise capital this year compared to 21 last year. The State Department has asked U.S. universities and colleges to divest their Chinese holdings due to stricter scrutiny from the Trump administration and potential delisting of all Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges. The warning came on the heels of a ban on Chinese short-video platform Tik Tok and Tencent’s messaging app WeChat.\nWhile it is difficult to obtain comprehensive data on the scope of U.S.-China crypto investment, there have recently been a few notable deals. Jump Trading, a U.S.-based security and cryptocurrency market maker for Robinhood, announced Thursday it would invest in decentralized exchange Serum, which has a large presence in Hong Kong. California-based funds Paradigm and Pantera led a $28 million Series A round in Hong Kong crypto startup Amber Group in February. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based blockchain investment firm Hashkey participated in crypto lender Blockfi’s $50 million Series C in August.\nDue to more lenient regulations on crypto trading and financial convenience in Hong Kong, some Chinese crypto and blockchain funds and crypto firms are based there rather than in mainland China. Companies might headquarter themselves in Hong Kong to take advantage of its regulatory regime and status in the financial world, when they are actually from, or subsidiaries of companies in, mainland China.\nDecentralization\nThe White House recently directed a retirement savings fund to stop investing in Chinese companies, citing threats to national security. But these restrictions don’t necessarily pose a threat to crypto startups.\n“A pension fund might find a hard time in allocating assets but it is a broad phenomenon that those funds do not invest in crypto regardless of the U.S.-China relations,” says Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital Partners, an Asia-focused crypto venture capital based in San Francisco.\nTypical institutional investors for crypto and blockchain funds are crypto exchanges and the investment firms that don’t receive capital for large pension funds or endowments, Qureshi said.\nRead more: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft\nDecentralized ownership structure makes crypto projects immune to geopolitical risks, said Sharlyn Wu, chief investment officer at Huobi, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume in the world.\n“Community-driven projects, especially the decentralized fiance protocols such as YFI, have a tendency to [avoid] venture capital firms,” Wu said.\nVenture funds normally take a stake in a firm and help it grow its business, something not possible with decentralized projects, Wu said.\n“However, crypto is about the decentralized network and you can’t really track down a particular group of people in a country,” she said.\nNational pride\nWestern crypto projects often appeal to Chinese investors.\n“Historically, there are relatively more innovative crypto projects from the West in general and these projects would attract investment from the East where they tend to have more liquidity,” said Omer Ozden, CEO of RockTree Capital, an investment firm with a focus on blockchain technology in Asia.\n“Chinese crypto investors are very enthusiastic and active, reflecting the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out ) phenomenon.”\nBut in China, political tensions occasionally bleed into the business sphere. If Chinese investors start favoring homegrown projects, that could spell trouble for U.S. crypto projects.\n“The tension in some way increases the viability of the Chinese crypto teams,” Qureshi said. “In part it means there would be more willingness within China to support some of the homegrown Chinese projects.”\nRead more: A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not.\nThere have been a slew of incidents where foreign companies have faced Chinese nationalist wrath because of political events.\nIn 2008, Chinese consumers protested French supermarket chain Carrefour when pro-Tibet Independence protestors snatched the torch during the Olympic relay in France. Last October, the National Basketball Association (NBA) took heat from China because of a tweet from Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, who posted an image that supported protesters in Hong Kong.\nWhile crypto is not fully shielded from political controversy, it helps that startups are not necessarily associated with one particular country. The crypto community is decentralized and global from the get-go and it is unlikely that it will be affected for geopolitical reasons, Wu said.\n“If your project is genuinely innovative, it will transcend beyond culture and languages,” she said.\nStrategic technology\nOne of the reasons why the U.S. wants to ban TikTok and WeChat is because they have so much data from American users. Permissionless blockchains, by contrast, aim to avoid the problem of honeypots of personal data.\n“The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not touched crypto,” Qureshi said. “On a broader level, the U.S. just doesn't see crypto or blockchain in particular as a strategic threat and we have pretty much shielded from any of that nonsense.”\nEven if there is a massive amount of data on a decentralized public blockchain, such projects decrease the reliance on one company, such as Facebook or Tik Tok.\nRead more: China’s Digital Currency May Come With Hardware Wallets as Well\n“You don’t need to trust anyone and you can just trust the code,” Wu said. “The code is open-source and on-chain. Everyone can check it out.”\nHowever, there are limitations on this decentralization, even for public blockchains. Some of the platforms will need to store their users’ data through centralized cloud service providers such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and Alibaba Cloud, which are subject to potential government surveillance. A government could also shut down a blockchain-based platform by cutting its Internet services in the country.\nEnterprise blockchain\nCompared to public decentralized blockchains, enterprise blockchains led by particular entities are more vulnerable to geopolitical tensions.\nAny centralized businesses, including those that develop enterprise blockchain, are subject to local regulatory and legal requirements as much as any other regular tech firms, Wu said.\nEnterprise blockchain, which is also called permissioned or private blockchain, has been widely used for data management such as record tracking, and comes with smart contracts that enable automated financial services transactions. They are typically governed by a small group of companies and only a handful of people have access to the data stored on-chain.\nSee also: The Latest on the Global Economy’s Most Contentious Relationship\nVarious tech conglomerates have developed their own enterprise blockchains, including IBM-backed Hyperledger, Ablibaba’s Ant Chain and Baidu’s XuperChain. The Chinese government is a major supporter of permissioned blockchain technology, and the Beijing municipal government recently launched a blockchain-based platform. Supported by Huawei Cloud, it will be able to manage data ranging from medical records to property registration.\nAlthough Chinese enterprise blockchain technology has not yet met with any political resistance for U.S. legislators, experts warned those projects will face higher policy risks if they achieve mass adoption and gather more user data in the future.\nFor example, the state-sanctioned blockchain infrastructure project Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), uses American cloud services providers such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud to store data for the global version of its network. It smoothly rolled out operation in August.",

    "summary": "China’s state-sanctioned Blockchain-Based Service Network is finally bringing public chains to its homeland -- but they will look very different.",
    "content": "China’s state-sanctioned blockchain infrastructure project is finally bringing public chains to its Chinese users – but with a significant twist.\nThe Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), a standardized internet services provider for decentralized applications (dapp) developers, plans to make 24 public chains available in its network for Chinese users starting from the second half of November, according to an internal memo obtained by CoinDesk.\nDevelopers can use the technical frameworks behind these public chains to build and run dapps that serve a range of purposes such as financing platforms for small and medium enterprises, source tracking for food companies and record-keeping for banks, law firms or government agencies.\nThese public chains will look quite different after being “localized” for the Chinese market, however. The network will make the decentralized public chains permissioned and replace their tokens with direct payment by the Chinese currency renminbi to cover transaction fees on these chains.\nThis is part of a much larger story. The Chinese government is an active supporter of blockchain technology – but only on its own terms. Authorities would like to reap the benefits of blockchain tech’s traceability and efficiency, but without the decentralization embraced by public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nBSN’s latest move came one month after the network integrated six major public chains into the global version of its network. This was so that developers outside China could use a standardized development environment to build and run decentralized applications on these public chains. Unlike in the localized version, public decentralized chains are allowed in the global version of BSN.\n“There have been few effective ways for public chains to enter the Chinese market and scale up due to legal and regulatory requirements and how these projects position themselves,” the memo, translated by Coindesk from the original Chinese, said of this latest development.\n“The public decentralized chains will become public permissioned consortium chains, which can be supervised by regulators, and that is currently the most direct and effective way for the projects to be compliant and reach domestic users within China.”\nRead more: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft\nThese new permissioned chains will look very different from the original versions. To make public decentralized chains, such as Ethereum, permissioned, BSN will only allow its designated operators to build and operate nodes, where dapps verify on-chain transactions and store data. The network will block all peer-to-peer fee transactions and require its users to use renminbi instead of Ethereum “gas” to cover fees for building and running dapps on chain.\n“BSN has made it technically impossible to do any virtual currency transactions on the public chains,” the memo said. “BSN strictly follows related laws and regulations and will remove any chain that violates them from the network.”\nBSN aims to complete all 24 public chains’ integration with the domestic version of the network during the first quarter of 2021 and enable these chains to share data with each other in the first half of the same year.\nThe networkhas formed Public Permissioned Blockchain, a consortium to govern the services on adapted public chains. Huobi Group, as the only named member of the consortium in the memo, will be in charge of transaction settlement and clearing, marketing for the new services and operating the official portal.\nAn unnamed cloud services provider will offer the adapted public chains data storage and other basic internet resources. One of BSN’s backers is Chinese tech conglomerate China Mobile, which has an extensive network of data centers across the country. BSN has also worked with the Chinese branch of Amazon Web Service to provide Internet services for dapps.\nBSN is backed by the State Information Center of China, a think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning agency. BSN will be responsible for compliance with Chinese regulators and adapting the public chains’ technical framework into the network.\nWhile the memo does not disclose any names of these 24 public chains, BSN has already integrated major international projects including Tezos, Ethereum and Cosmos’ IrisNet.\n“The 24 public chains are highly reputable in the global blockchain community, however, we will not use their original names when they go live on BSN,” the memo said. The chains will be renamed based on 24 Chinese solar terms, a traditional agricultural calendar that informs farmers of seasonal changes.\nFor example, one of the 24 solar terms is First Frost, which indicates the weather is getting colder and water droplets are starting to freeze. Insect Awakening means it is getting warmer and insects that hibernate underground are about to wake up and go outside.\nThe forbidden fruit\nPublic decentralized blockchains have been under heavy scrutiny from the Chinese government since 2017, when China cracked down on initial coin offerings and local exchanges. ICO projects were hard to supervise because of their decentralized nature, and authorities feared that wild token speculation could undermine China’s financial stability.\nThe tokens from public chain projects are a threat to China’s long-standing capital control and monetary sovereignty of the Chinese currency.\nFor example, tether, an Ethereum-based token pegged to the U.S. dollar, has become one of the most popular ways for cross-border transactions between Asia and the rest of the world. Authorities may also fear tokens could threaten the use of the renminbi and that would jeopardize monetary policies relying on the control of supply and demand of the Chinese currency.\nRead more: China’s Blockchain Infrastructure to Extend Global Reach With Six Public Chains\nIn part to pre-empt the rise of tokens such as bitcoin, the Chinese central bank invented its own national virtual currency, Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) or the digital yuan.\nAnother reason why China is critical of public decentralized chain projects is the potential for scams, such as Ponzi and pump-and-dump schemes offered as initial coin offerings (ICO) that mushroomed during and after the 2017 ICO boom. In September 2017, the Chinese central bank made any centralized ICO fundraising illegal.\nThe People’s Bank of China also carried out a slew of crackdowns on centralized crypto exchanges and fiat-crypto trading, and prohibited any Chinese bank from processing crypto-related transactions.\nInspired by AntChain\nAntChain, a permissioned enterprise blockchain developed by Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, has been one of the inspirations for BSN to launch the Public Permissioned Blockchain consortium, according to the memo.\n“It was a milestone when the company launched Ant Blockchain Open Alliance, a consortium that governs its blockchain-based platform lowering the cost for small and medium enterprises to use blockchain technology,” the memo said. “Technically speaking, it is a public permissioned chain with a few authorized nodes.”\nRead more: China’s Blockchain Infrastructure Launches Website for Global Devs\nOne of the main missions for Ant Financial is to provide small and medium enterprises with a more accessible financing platform based on its public permissioned blockchain technology. The company could also leverage the large client base of Alibaba’s other subsidiaries, such as Ali Cloud for internet and data services and the digital payment company Ant Financial for any financial transactions in its app.\nAnt Financial claims its users had been uploading an average of $100 million in digital assets, including copyright and property ownership certificates as well as transaction records, to its blockchain in July. Chinese shipping giant Cosco said it was trialing AntChain for tamper-free documentation including container records and import licenses.\nThe company aims to go public on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges at a valuation of $200 billion. If the deal follows through, it will be arguably the largest company that operates its own enterprise blockchain.",

    "summary": "One of the techniques that his team deploys to protect the blockchain is “fuzzing,” a term borrowed from the software-development industry that’s become a common way of checking to make sure a system is secure and resilient.",
    "content": "A typical day for David Theodore, a security researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, often starts with him checking to see if there were any crashes on Ethereum, the world’s largest smart-contracts blockchain.\nAfter that, he and his colleagues set about trying to break it themselves.\n“Our goal is to break things hopefully before anyone else breaks them, so there's nothing else left to break,” Theodore told CoinDesk in an interview.\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\nTheodore, 33, is one of about 10 computer engineers and cybersecurity professionals on the Ethereum Foundation’s security research team, based on a slide presentation from June. They cast themselves as the ultimate maintainers – and guardians – of the fast-growing network, seen by some blockchain experts as the foundation of a future global, digital, and decentralized financial system.\nThe Ethereum Foundation, created by the blockchain’s famous founder, Vitalik Buterin, and set up to support development of the network, boasts a workforce of roughly 150 people, according to the slide presentation. Most of the focus is on constant programming upgrades, growth initiatives, sponsoring developer conferences and providing grants.\nSo this squad of security researchers represents just a sliver of the foundation’s overall operations. But in a crypto industry renowned for pushing out new protocols and applications that later prove vulnerable to expensive exploits, the team’s role could not be more crucial: Hackers are always looking for new points of attack, and a single slip-up could result in a devastating blow to a blockchain’s reputation as a safe place to transact.\n'Always fuzzing'\nThe team members come from a wide array of backgrounds and specializations – many of them with computer science degrees, but experience in responding to exploits, attacking distributed systems and the applying cryptography.\nOne of the techniques that the security team deploys to protect the blockchain is “fuzzing,” a term borrowed from the software-development industry that’s become a common way of checking to make sure a system is secure and resilient.\nTranslated to the context of working on Ethereum, members of the security team feed invalid inputs into network nodes to reveal bugs or vulnerabilities in the software. The point of fuzzing is to see if there are any negative reactions to the system.\n“We're always fuzzing. We have big supercomputers fuzzing all the time,” Theodore told CoinDesk. “They're fuzzing everything, while you work, while you sleep.”\nLife of an Ethereum security researcher\nIn 24/7 crypto, a day in the life for Theodore always looks a little bit different.\n“If you see panics or errors of any kind, anything that looks like there's failures,\" he says, \"you go look at them and you say, ‘Is this a problem because of my fuzzer or is this a problem that an attacker could make the same problem?’”\nBased in Austin, Texas, Theodore sometimes takes his office on the road – in an Airstream recreational vehicle with a dedicated office that allows him to keep fuzzing even when parked in remote locales.\nThe portable office fits two big monitors and connects to the outside world via Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service. The space is big enough for two people and a dog to inhabit comfortably, Theodore says.\nIn late 2022, the Airstream served as his base, parked in Granby, Colorado, in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park, as Ethereum developers were pushing toward a milestone known as the “Merge” – when the project transitioned to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network from the “proof-of-work” system used by Bitcoin, the original blockchain.\n“We were there for a month before the Merge,” Theodore recalled. It was a convenient location, since he could easily travel to Boulder, Colorado, to meet up with other Ethereum Foundation team members to witness the historic event.\nTheodore studied electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington, but after graduation, pivoted to a career in cybersecurity. He spent the early part of his career in the offensive cybersecurity unit at Raytheon, before eventually moving to data forensics firm SkySafe and then to tech giant Google in 2020.\nHe joined the Ethereum Foundation in 2021 after learning that the organization was forming a security team. Initially, his role was to research how to protect the blockchain during the transition to proof-of-stake.\nSince then, the job has evolved to a broader mandate of maintaining the integrity of the network.\n“They wanted to make a team that specializes in this kind of thing, the ins and outs of how nation states fund these cyber operations and how they go about them,” Theodore told CoinDesk. The foundation recruited members that could “apply that methodology here and stay a step ahead and try to make Ethereum robust.”\nIn June, Theodore delivered a presentation about the Ethereum Foundation security research team to a group of Austin crypto developers, listing responsibilities including “general hardfork security,” “beaconchain health,” bug bounty programs, “client security coordination,” and “client diversity advocacy.”\n“Our team has found bugs in every CL and EL client and more,” according to one of the presentation slides. “CL” stands for Ethereum’s consensus layer, where validators of the blockchain are hosted and verified, and “EL” stands for the blockchain’s execution layer, where transactions are completed and the state of the blockchain is recorded and managed.\nHis job is quite untraditional compared to other cybersecurity officials, he says – partly because the organization adheres to a more horizontal management structure, and also because the job can be done from pretty much anywhere.\nEthereum, renowned for its “smart contracts” that allow for programmability and the hosting of decentralized applications, has expanded rapidly, especially now that it serves as the confirmation and settlement hub – the \"layer 1\" or \"L1\" – for an array of “layer-2” blockchains that work atop of it, such as Arbitrum, Optimism and the crypto exchange Coinbase’s new Base blockchain.\nAnd as more value is accrued on the network, Theodore believes that the team’s security mandate will grow in importance.\nThe total market capitalization of Ethereum’s native ether (ETH) tokens currently stands at about $212 billion.\n“I think we're critical,” Theodore shared. “The most that is synonymous with security, if you're talking about block space, is the Ethereum L1.”",

    "title": "What’s at Stake for Crypto in India as the World’s Largest Democracy Is in the Midst of Its National Election?",
    "summary": "Crypto’s significance as an election issue remains non-existent or at best negligible.",
    "content": "India’s general election in 2024 is not expected to immediately affect crypto policy, and its current – restrictive – rules are expected to continue on through the upcoming Parliamentary term.\nThe world’s most populated country and the fastest growing major economy kicked off its multi-phased elections this month, with results expected on June 4, 2024. Several industry analysts told CoinDesk they don't expect any changes to crypto policy after the next term's lawmakers are elected, resulting in the near-term continuation of rules that have stifled the nation's digital asset ecosystem.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, 73, is aiming for a third five-year term as the face of the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), and is overwhelmingly expected to win the elections, pre-election surveys have shown.\nSuch is his expected dominance that the Indian National Congress (INC), the major opposition party and several regional parties, around 40 in total, have come together to form a coalition called I.N.D.I.A (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) to fight him.\nThe election is for 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament, referred to as the Lok Sabha. The party or alliance with the most seats would select the country's prime minister and form a government.\nCrypto as an election issue\nCrypto’s significance as an election issue remains non-existent or at best negligible. Web3 remains esoteric for an overwhelming majority of the voting population. Even the fact that India has implemented a steep tax deducted at source on crypto transactions (1% on every transaction) is unlikely to play a role in this year's election in any major way.\nIssues such as lack of jobs, a Hindu-nationalist agenda against a constitutionally enshrined secularism, alleged marginalization of minorities, the role of electoral bonds, institutional independence and agrarian policies have dominated the headlines, making sure that crypto is not even a political talking point.\n“Indian elections are still focussed mainly around socio-political issues,” said Kiran Vivekananda, Chief Public Policy officer at one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, CoinDCX. “Technology has started becoming an agenda item but is more from the setting up [of a] manufacturing base in India and the job-creation lens.”\nYet, Vivekananda expressed hope that the incoming government would work more closely with the industry to understand its challenges, provide solutions and protect the interests of citizens. However, other entrepreneurs believe more needs to be done by the Indian crypto industry.\n“Developments in the U.S. show that crypto can indeed become a political talking point, influencing policy and voter choices,” said Ashish Khandelwal, founder of Anq, a digital banking platform and a person who has been engaging with legislators. “To mirror the U.S., the Indian crypto industry needs to highlight how the tech can offer more than just investment opportunities, creating awareness around tangible benefits.”\nNo crypto-related promises\nNeither major party, Modi’s BJP nor the INC, have mentioned the words cryptocurrency, blockchain or Web3 in their manifestos. However, this isn’t necessarily reflective of their plans toward the ecosystem. Indian government and political stakeholders, like other nations, have often used euphemisms to refer to the crypto-related space.\nThe ruling BJP’s manifesto said the party would educate senior citizens to avoid digital scams, take stringent action against those who threaten the nation’s digital sovereignty and would develop “Digital Public Infrastructure to remove information asymmetry in agriculture.”\nThe Congress Party (another name for INC) said it would give farmers the option to upload the sale-and-purchase agreement of the produce on a “digital ledger” and “work on digital/cybersecurity issues that may threaten India's digital financial infrastructure.”\nSo far, during Modi's second term, his crypto-related policies included stiff taxes including a 30% tax on profits from selling digital assets, no off-setting of losses, a 1% tax deducted at source for every transaction and mandated registration of exchanges with India’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog. These policies and other enforcement related actions brought the industry to its knees.\nOnly the recent bull run and the government’s banning of off-shore exchanges at the nudging of India’s crypto policy advocacy body appears to have brought some respite to the industry.\nThe Modi government “has consistently maintained a lukewarm stance towards cryptocurrencies,” putting in place a “patchwork of regulations,” said Mohit Chawdhry, a fellow at the Esya Centre Think Tank which has extensively researched how the crypto policies have so far impacted the industry.\nA weak opposition party has not framed a comprehensive position on crypto policy, though at this point it is simply fighting for survival against the Modi juggernaut.\nNo major changes in the near-term\nRegardless of how Parliament shakes out, India’s Web3 policies are expected to remain largely unchanged in the near future.\nIn the more likely scenario of Modi winning, his policies are expected to continue, and even if they would be updated, crypto is unlikely to be an immediate priority. Modi’s government has made no public indications that once it comes to power, crypto policy may be updated.\nIn another, less likely, scenario of the opposition alliance winning, the coalition government is likely to have other priorities. The coalition has not yet indicated any thoughts on how its members may approach crypto policy.\nThe best case scenario for a change in India’s crypto policy is around the end of 2024,\none person familiar with the framing of crypto regulations in the government but unauthorized to speak to reporters told CoinDesk.\nAnd this isn't due to any specific policies that may be updated or introduced – it will simply take the government months to transition into governing after election results are announced in six weeks.\nThe Modi government “does not appear to be keen on a holistic policy framework for virtual digital assets,” said the Esya Centre's Chawdhry. “It seems that other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and extended reality, are higher priorities for policymakers.”\nRecently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman remained slightly ambiguous about crypto, saying the government’s position has always been that crypto assets can be traded, but that the government hasn't regulated them in the past, and won't change that stance yet.\nSome change by 2025\nThe past few years of the Modi government indicate changes will come.\nOne of the major achievements touted by the Modi government has been its role in shaping globally coordinated crypto policy under its 2023 presidency of the Group of 20. India made it a priority and brought the major economies of the world to agree to a set of guidelines.\nIndia has also purportedly achieved its ambitions with the digital rupee.\n\"The policymaking process for crypto will definitely pick up pace in this (expected and upcoming) term of the Modi government,” said Tanvi Ratna, the founder and CEO of the emerging technology think tank Policy 4.0, which contributed to key research and inputs towards the G20 policy framework created under India.\n“We can expect a close alignment between the government strategy [and] the global framework agreed by the G20 under India's leadership. Also worth noting that India's crypto policy will evolve alongside the scale up and launch of the eRupee. We are looking towards a very dynamic five years in India,” Ratna said.\nRead More: India Won't See Crypto or Web3 Bill for Another 18 Months, Senior Lawmaker Tells CoinDesk",

    "content": "p0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nBlockchain technologies that underpin crypto could help issuers of financial instruments like bonds reduce financing costs in the next five years, according to a report by credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service.\nWhile incorporating these technologies into businesses could increase IT costs and require \"substantial investment\" at first, it could help lower expenses over time, the report published Wednesday said.\nRecent innovations have increased the transformative potential of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) when applied to financial markets, Moody's said. While AI could potentially reduce operating expenses for financial institutions by automating manual tasks, DLT could \"gradually lower financing expenses, especially for smaller issuers,\" according to the report.\n\"DLT could improve financial market efficiency, modernize the payment system, and foster financial inclusion,\" Vincent Gusdorf, head of DeFi and digital asset analytics, said in a press statement shared with CoinDesk. \"The overall economic and financial effects of technological changes, including the policy and strategic changes they prompt, are likely to be positive.\"\nDigital or tokenized bonds, which are becoming popular in global markets, could lower transaction expenses and make capital markets more accessible by letting organizations bypass intermediaries like banks and by increasing liquidity on the secondary market, the report said. Hong Kong's central bank arrived at similar conclusions following a successful $100 million tokenized bond issue from earlier this year.\nDLT could also enable some businesses to capture untapped revenue opportunities and enter new markets.\nAlthough the effects of employing these new technologies in finance will likely be positive, \"they will vary greatly by country, region, company, and worker, with some suffering from technology-driven disruption,\" the report said.\nThe technology's promise, however, comes with drawbacks such as potentially challenging sovereign authority and fueling tax evasion, money laundering and terrorism if not used and regulated well.\nMoody's said it plans to track how technological transformation in financial markets fueled by AI and DLT could affect credit risk stemming from borrowers failing to repay loans.\nRead more: Tokenization Could Improve Bond Market Efficiency, Hong Kong Regulator Says",

    "title": "Why Polygon's MATIC Token Has Lagged During Past Year's Crypto Rally",
    "summary": "MATIC was overvalued at the start of the ongoing crypto bull run, one observer said.",
    "content": "The native token of the Polygon ecosystem (MATIC), a market darling during the 2021 bull run, has been less of a hit with crypto traders over the past year, missing out on a big rally in cryptocurrencies.\nThe cryptocurrency declined about 32% in 12 months, significantly underperforming rival layer-2 coins like OP and SKL, which have risen 216%, 46% and 50%, respectively, according to CoinDesk Indices. Arbitrum’s ARB, which has existed for less than a year, has seen more significant gains than MATIC in six months.\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has more than doubled to $51,700 in one year, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, the broader market gauge, has risen 70%. Ethereum's native token, ether (ETH), is up 76%.\nMATIC’s dismal performance is in contrast to 2021, when the token was on a tear, producing market-beating triple-digit price gains even during the corrective phases of the bull run.\nIndeed, the excitement back then might have been due to the project's then-front-runner status as the leading sidechain – a type of auxiliary network – for Ethereum.\nBut the technological race has since shifted, with investors and developers alike now favoring a different type of scaling networks known as \"rollups.\"\nPolygon has pivoted, setting up Polygon zkEVM, employs ZK-rollup technology, bundling and processing transactions outside the Ethereum main chain. Polygon's biggest rivals, Arbitrum and Optimism, are other popular Ethereum scaling solutions, based on a slightly different but popular technology known as \"optimistic rollups.\"\nBut Polygon is still supporting its legacy chain, known as Polygon PoS, which uses the Plasma framework with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\nPolygon is now pushing Polygon CDK, a \"chain development kit\" built around the ZK tech that can be used by other developers to spin up their own layer-2 networks. Last week, Polygon claimed a technological feat with its release of a \"Type 1 prover,\" a new component allowing any network compatible with Ethereum's EVM standard to become a layer-2 network powered by zero-knowledge proofs.\nPolygon officials declined to provide a comment for this story.\nIt's possible the months-long turnaround strategy may be starting to show signs of a payoff. In the past month, MATIC has gained 24%, versus 14% climb during that period in the benchmark CoinDesk 20 index of the largest digital assets.\nPolygon is set to come out soon with a new protocol known as the \"aggregation layer\" or \"AggLayer\" aiming to unite \"a divided blockchain landscape into a web of ZK-secured L1 and L2 chains that feels like a single chain.\" Along with the sprint to roll out Polygon CDK, such initiatives could shift the investor mood.\nBut the lack of investor interest in the token over the past year could stem from a couple of reasons, including the way Polygon zkEVM ensures the validity of transactions, which puts it at a disadvantage to Optimism and Arbitrum when it comes to benefitting from Ethereum’s impending Dencun upgrade, according to Katie Talati, director of research at digital-asset management firm Arca.\nThe Dencun effect\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade, slated for March 12, will introduce a new type of transaction called a blob, attaching large, fixed-sized data chunks to a regular transaction (imagine side carts on a motorcycle). Unlike call data or the memory permanently used to store transaction details, blob-carrying transactions only include a reference hash to the blob’s data stored off-chain and become inaccessible after three weeks or so.\nIn other words, blobs will reduce transaction costs and boost efficiency by delivering large data packets to recipients without congesting the main net.\nThe upgrade is particularly favorable for layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon zkEVM that use the rollup technology. Rollups bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then submit the data to the Ethereum main chain for verification. The main chain, however, often faces congestion, which raises the cost of submitting data to the main chain.\nAfter the upgrade, rollups could store their transaction data using blobs, freeing up space on the mainnet and processing more transactions at a lesser cost.\nThat said, Polygon zkEVM functions on the principle of “guilty until found innocent.” The rollup operators must provide proof of validity to finalize transactions on Ethereum. This resource-intensive task will continue adding to the overall transaction cost after the Dencun upgrade.\nOn the other hand, Optimistic rollups operate on the “innocent until proven” principle and must produce a fraud-proof flag only when the transaction is challenged. Thus, they stand to benefit from the expected decline in transaction costs following the Dencun upgrade.\n“The upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade will decrease costs for layer 2's to post data back to the Ethereum mainnet. Although Polygon will benefit from the upgrade, other L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism, which use optimistic rollups, will see more significant cost reductions, which has caused these L2s to rally,” Talati told CoinDesk in an interview.\n“Most of the cost for optimistic rollups comes from posting transaction data back to Ethereum (which is what Dencun will reduce), but they hardly post fraud proofs. On the other hand, Zk rollups post fraud proofs far more frequently and, therefore, would not see the benefits of lower transaction data costs,” Talati explained.\nOn the other hand, since Polygon typically posts more data to Ethereum, it might stand to benefit more from the Dencun changes.\nKey departure\nFormer Polygon President Ryan Wyatt’s decision to move to Optimism could be another reason for the lack of a notable uptrend in MATIC.\n“The second reason for the underperformance is that Ryan Wyatt, the former president of Polygon, left last year to join as the head of business development for Optimism. Many believe that Wyatt was responsible for Polygon’s big partnerships, and his exit has been a considerable blow to Polygon’s growth efforts,” Talati said.\nThe MATIC price rose 2.5% when Wyatt's departure was disclosed on July 7, the same day it was announced that Marc Boiron had been promoted to CEO.\nArbitrum, a go-to blockchain for traders\nData tracked by DefiLama shows that Arbitrum is the fourth-largest chain, with a 24-hour trading volume of $420 million. Polygon PoS ranks 6th, with a trading volume of $179 million, followed by Optimism’s $133 million.\nArbitrum is also the leading rollup, with $3 billion worth of assets locked in its decentralized finance protocols. Optimism is the second largest, with $884 million, while Polygon ZkEVM ranks 12th, with total value locked at $14.7 million.\n“The toughest competitor to MATIC is Arbitrum (ARB), and unfortunately for MATIC, Arbitrum is the go-to blockchain for traders,” Kenny Hearn, chief investment officer at SwissOne Capital, said in an email, adding that Arbitrum is leading the surge in DeFi trading volumes.\nAccording to Hearn, MATIC was overvalued at the start of the ongoing crypto market uptrend, and other layer-2 coins are playing catchup.\n“Looking into the numbers, one can easily find the relative valuations stacking up. The top 10 apps’ TVL on each chain totals ARB $1.9bn, MATIC $800mn. Then, comparing their Fully-Diluted Valuations (FDV) of $20bn and $10bn, respectively, the relative valuations make more sense,” Hearn noted.\n“When comparing tokenomics, both ARB and OPT are still rewarding stakers though native token unlocks, and like it or not, it can add to reducing token supply on exchanges while rewarding Pool/TVL contributors,” he added.",

    "content": "Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital (MARA) has mined an invalid Bitcoin block at height 809478, according to several developers, miners and researchers.\nThe miner confirmed the mining of the invalid block on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), citing a bug during an experiment. \"We utilize a small portion of our hash rate to experiment with our development pool and research potential methods to optimize our operations,\" Marathon said. \"The error was the result of an unanticipated bug that came from one of our experiments,\" the company added.\nEarlier Wednesday, anonymous Bitcoin developer \"0xB10C\" wrote on X that MaraPool had a \"transaction ordering issue,\" which was confirmed by CasaHODL co-founder Jameson Lopp.\nThe invalid Bitcoin block was rejected by other node operators. The block contained a transaction that was ordered incorrectly with a spending output transaction, thus, the block was invalidated, according to BitMEX Research.\nThe mining of invalid block raised some questions within the community as to the security of the network. However, the rejection of the block was cited by Marathon as an example of the resilience of the Bitcoin network.\n\"In no way was this experiment an attempt to alter Bitcoin Core in any way,\" the miner said, adding that the incident was unintended but \"underscores the robust security of the Bitcoin network, which rejected and rectified the anomaly.\"\nThe miner's shares were down nearly 2% on Wednesday, while peer Riot Platform (RIOT) was down about 0.7%, and bitcoin price was mostly positive.\nUPDATE: (Sept. 27, 16:56 UTC): Updates throughout to add confirmation by Marathon and comments from the company.",

    "content": "Another crypto bill has scored a victory in a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, with the panel's unanimous approval of legislation that would direct the U.S. secretary of commerce to support blockchain technology.\nThe brief, 13-page legislation isn't among the big-ticket bills that the industry is desperate to see emerge from Congress, but the so-called Deploying American Blockchains Act marks a small, forward step for congressional efforts friendly to crypto. It joins several other crypto bills that have – for the first time – cleared committee votes on the way to the House floor, though none have yet won approval by the overall House.\nThe House Committee on Energy and Commerce, in a work session to weigh dozens of bills this week, voted 46-0 to clear the legislation that would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce \"to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.\"\nThe bill doesn't yet have a counterpart in the U.S. Senate – the chief drawback of most of this year's crypto legislation. The Democrat-controlled chamber hasn't rushed to embrace any of the digital assets bills and is widely thought to be unlikely to change course. The best bet for such bills could be negotiations that meld them with other efforts into larger must-pass legislation.\n\"At least on the tech side of things, Energy and Commerce is unanimously in support, and there’s nothing partisan about it,\" said Ron Hammond, the Blockchain Association's director of government relations, in an interview. \"Largely these bills have either gotten looped together into larger bills or lead to agency action at Commerce, which has been very open to conversation.\"\nRead More: Commerce Dept.

    "content": "An investor holding a large amount of ether (ETH), a so-called whale, who began trading the Ethereum blockchain's native token in 2017 moved a large chunk of it to crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday, in a possible precursor to liquidating the holding.\nRoughly 18 hours ago, the address x50b42514389F25E1f471C8F03f6f5954df0204b0 transferred 12,000 ETH (worth $42.8 million at the time) to Binance, according to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain. That's about 0.01% of the total circulating supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The same address moved nearly 9,000 ETH to Binance on Tuesday, withdrawing 30 million tether (USDT). Tether is the world's largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.\n\"A giant whale deposited 12K ETH to Binance 1 hour ago and may sell it,\" Lookonchain posted on X during Wednesday's U.S. trading hours.\nMoving coins into addresses tied to cryptocurrency exchanges often indicates an intention to sell or deploy coins as a margin in derivatives trading. Thus, a large inflow of coins frequently presages increased price volatility.\nIt's possible the whale was looking to sell the cryptocurrency on the rise. Ether rose 11% to $3,500 on Wednesday, reversing a Tuesday slide. At press time, it was trading at $3,535, according to CoinDesk data.\nThe rally occurred even after reports emerged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking to classify ETH as a security, a move that would derail plans for listing spot ether exchange-traded funds in the country and subject ETH and projects interacting with Ethereum to more stringent regulation.\nStill, data from Deribit's options market shows traders are more bearish on ether than bitcoin (BTC). While ether's one-week put options trade at a 4% premium to its calls, bitcoin's puts trade at a 2% premium. A similar dynamic is observed in options expiring in one month, according to data tracked by Amberdata.\nA put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against an impending price drop.",

    "content": "Inflows to Coinbase’s (COIN) new Base blockchain were muted on the first day after its official launch, failing to meet the expectations of some crypto traders that massive amounts of capital would flow in.\nJust over $10 million was bridged, or transferred, to the new blockchain in the past 24 hours, according to data in a Dune Analytics dashboard, with just over 15,000 new users and 40% fewer transactions than Wednesday.\nOf that amount, $5.6 million was in the form of ether (ETH), $2.3 million in USD coin (USDC) and the rest was a plethora of alternative cryptocurrencies.\nRead more: Coinbase Exec: ‘There’s No Playbook’ for Public Company Launching Blockchain\nWallet analysis shows most Base users transferred between $500 to $1,000 worth of ether on average. The biggest wallet to bridge, “0xcc...1763,” has transferred $17 million of tokens.\nBase went live at 12 p.m. ET (16:00 UTC) on Wednesday, marking the first time a publicly traded company has released its own blockchain.\nWhy the slow day?\nA reason for the slow first day could be that most investors who wanted to bridge to Base did so before the official launch — namely, by finding out a deposit address meant for developers and using it to pour money into “sh**coins” instead.\nIn late July, the issuance of viral meme coin bald (BALD) saw traders jump in ahead of the official launch in the search for outsized returns, sending over $66 million via a one-way bridge to Base.\nThe lure of meme-coin fortunes — such as BALD, which jumped 4,000,000% before collapsing — in a starved market likely helped Base attract $68 million in ether in less than 48 hours. At the time, Base ended up recording over $200 million in trading volume and more transactions than popular networks such as Arbitrum over the weekend.\nDespite outsiders' worries about rug pulls and scams, Coinbase is amping up efforts to draw users to and generate revenue from the new network.\nThe exchange kicked off “On-chain Summer,” a virtual event, on Wednesday in celebration of Base’s mainnet launch. It features more than 50 brands, including Coca-Cola (KO), Friends With Benefits, a social decentralized autonomous organization and others in events that will run through the end of August.\nCoinbase is also encouraging users to transfer their ether to Base in order to mint a free non-fungible token to commemorate the launch of the Base mainnet. According to data from Etherscan, more than 125,000 individuals have minted more than 30 million free NFTs so far.\nBut do traders want a shiny, rocketing meme coin instead?",

In the digital world, SSI is said to give users more control over their personal data and its distribution online.\nShiba Inu developers say they have been working with community projects — such as those using SHIB or planning to build on the upcoming Shibarium blockchain — to ensure SSI deployment is a priority.\nThe developers say the rising interest in digital identities and data protection in Canada and the European Union could help position Shiba Inu as a tamer project compared with other blockchains.\n\"We are laying the groundwork for a new global standard in decentralized digital trust and international identity verification,” pseudonymous Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama said in a message to CoinDesk. “In this way, Shibarium is the herald of a new digital age where faith in systems is restored and enhanced.”\nSHIB, which was initially a meme coin, is turning into a serious blockchain contender with the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network will use BONE, TREAT, SHIB and LEASH tokens for applications built on the blockchain.\n\"Layer 2\" refers to a set of off-chain systems — separate blockchains — built on top of layer 1 networks. They bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load on layer 1 networks and fees for users.\nA test blockchain for Shibarium has processed 27 million transactions from an estimated 16 million wallets as of July, indicating brisk demand for the network.

    "summary": "Orbit is a program for developers to spin up their own layer-3 blockchains atop Arbitrum, which in turn is the largest layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "content": "The Arbitrum Foundation said new \"layer-3\" networks created via the project's \"Orbit\" program can now settle to the Arbitrum main network.\nThe foundation, an organization that says it's dedicated to the decentralization of Arbitrum, which is the biggest layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, made the announcement Thursday on X (formerly Twitter).\nThe move followed \"months of development,\" according to the post.\nOrbit is a program started earlier this year that blockchain developers can use to spin up their own layer-2 or layer-3 networks, using Arbitrum's technology. Previously, these new layer-3 networks were only settling on an Arbitrum test network, according to Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, the primary developer behind Arbitrum.\nThe Orbit program was one of the first announcements by the foundation when it was formed in March in an effort to decentralize Arbitrum. In June, Offchain Labs released Orbit documentation for developer-only networks or \"devnets.\"\nAccording to Offchain Labs, Orbit lets developers “create your own dedicated chain that settles to one of Arbitrum's layer 2 or L2 chains,” on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Arbitrum Goerli and Arbitrum Sepolia.\nProjects including Syndr had previously disclosed that they had chosen Arbitrum's Orbit network to build on, at that point settling to Arbitrum's Goerli testnet.\nThe move comes as the biggest developers of Ethereum layer-2 networks, including not just Arbitrum but OP Labs (behind Optimism), Polygon and Matter Labs (behind zkSync), are making their technology available to builders to clone or modify for their own use. The idea is that the projects can derive benefits or possibly licensing or other revenue from providing the blueprint or foundation for additional networks that theoretically would be interoperable or at least compatible.\n\"Today's announcement of Arbitrum Orbit's mainnet readiness as well as the initial cohort of 10 Orbit chains marks a big moment for the continued proliferation of the Arbitrum technology,\" Goldfeder told CoinDesk in a direct message.\nSeparately, Arbitrum Foundation said Wednesday that it has tapped Celestia, a modular solution, for Orbit to use them as data availability layer. Apps built on top of Orbit will have the option to publish their data to Celestia, once the solution goes live.\nOrbit is one of many customizable blockchain stacks that have come to market over the past few months. Arbitrum’s competitor, OP Labs, behind the layer-2 chain OP Mainnet (formerly named Optimism), has its own version of a customizable environment, called the OP Stack, which currently powers crypto exchange Coinbase layer-2 network, Base.\nRead more: Coinbase Officially Launches Base Blockchain in Milestone for a Public Company",

    "content": "Traders use several technical and fundamental indicators to navigate the speedy and risky crypto market.\nThey can consider adding one more to the list: A gauge of \"slippage\" in the ether market. The indicator has consistently identified trend changes in the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency this year.\nSlippage is the difference between the price at which a trading order is executed and the price at which it was requested. It occurs in fast-moving, highly volatile market conditions or when liquidity is low.\nIn both cases, the price moves faster than the time it takes for the order to fill either because of the volatility or the lack of supply, and can work in favor of or against traders. For instance, if a purchase order is executed at a price higher than the quoted price, it's the case of high (or unfavorable) slippage.\nA spike in slippage in the ether market has historically presaged trend changes, data provided by Crypto research firm Hyblock Capital show.\nThe chart shows ether's USDT-denominated price and aggregated maximum slippage – the highest daily slippage on a single market order. The aggregated max slippage includes data from crypto exchanges Binance, BitMEX, Bybit, Bitfinex, Deribit, Huobi, OKX, Phemex, and quarterly futures listed on Huobi and OKX.\nEther's late 2021 bull market peak and the December 2022 bear market bottom coincided with a sudden and notable increase in slippage. Similar spikes in slippage have marked interim tops and bottoms this year.",

    "content": "Celestia, the modular blockchain that claims to scale with more users, has struggled to wrangle much of a market share in its first week, with less than 350,000 transactions registered in the four days following its release.\nData from Mintscan shows that current transactions per second (TPS) on Celestia is 0.19. This doesn't necessarily translate to a lack of technical function, but it does mean a lack of activity on the blockchain.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nBy comparison, Ethereum is currently recording 29.33 TPS, according to data from L2Beat. Arbitrum, another modular blockchain, has been hitting between 35 and 45 TPS on average over the past week.\nAround 190,000 users claimed Celestia's airdrops on Tuesday despite more than 600,000 being eligible to do so, leaving slightly less than $1 million in unclaimed value.\nRead more: Celestia Airdrops TIA Token as Network Goes Live, Claims Start of 'Modular Era'\nThe token currently trades at $2.33 with a market cap of $329 million. Daily trading volume peaked at $475 million on Wednesday. It has since dropped to around $170 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\nIt's worth noting that Celestia's business model is centered around data availability, which is designed to scale Celestia and the entire crypto ecosystem as a whole. Modular blockchains work by creating specific channels for speed and execution, unlike monolithic blockchains.\nDespite a slow start in terms of activity, Celestia network validators can currently receive around 23.39% APR as a yield for staking the native TIA token, considerably higher than Ethereum's rate of 3.8%.\nThe performance of the TIA token has also been impressive compared to the likes of sui (SUI) and aptos (APT), both of which were airdropped to early adopters over the past year, and both endured bitter downturns after being issued. The stability of TIA can be attributed to a low level of inflation, as early investors and core developers have their token allocation locked up until October 2024.\nRead more: How a Ph.D. Student's Research Paper Turned Celestia Into $345M Blockchain Project Overnight",

According to the website mempool.space, which tracks activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, the fee paid was $2.97.\nThe SEC has been at the center of intense speculation not only because of the regulator's longstanding opposition to a spot Bitcoin ETF, but also a hack on Tuesday of its official Twitter account that led to a fake posting of an approval announcement, roiling crypto markets.\nThe choice of wording for Tuesday's Bitcoin transaction stunt recalls the message purportedly embedded into the blockchain's original \"Genesis\" block in 2009, a headline from British newspaper The Times that read: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"",

    "content": "Blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs has partnered with Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx in an effort to combat scams in the nation, an announcement on Monday said.\nThe program will trial an apparent global first in which Aussie crypto users who activate two-factor authentication on their cryptocurrency accounts will be paid AUD 10 (USD 6.6) worth of Bitcoin. It has been launched to coincide with the Australian government's Scam Awareness Week (Nov. 27th to Dec. 1st). The trial will test the impact on investment fraud levels of rewarding crypto customers for protecting their accounts and educating themselves about how to avoid scams, the announcement said.\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process requiring two forms of identification to access resources. The method provides a higher level of security than single-factor processes, in which the user provides a single form of identification, usually a password or passcode.\nEver since the collapse of FTX, Australia has taken steps to tighten its crypto regulation policy. The year 2023 has seen Australian regulators take action against crypto-related companies such as Block Earner and eToro. Blockchain industry stakeholders in Australia have taken a stand against restrictions on crypto payments by local banks. The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) was one such platform that applied partial restrictions citing scams. Binance Australia also halted deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer \"due to a decision made\" by a third-party payment service provider. Australia's government and the Blockchain industry then appeared to have reached a compromise.\nIn 2022, Aussies reported a loss of AUD 221 million (USD 146 million) in cryptocurrency, an increase of 162.4% from the previous year, according to the announcement. This year, Swyftx has stopped AUD 3 million in customer funds from going to scammers.\nThe initial 2,000 customers who enable two-factor authentication on their accounts and complete a course co-created with TRM Labs will be paid the reward by Swyftx. The partnership also encourages customers to report suspected fraud on chainabuse.com, a free scam-reporting website operated by TRM Labs. Customers can check addresses before engaging with them on the website.\nAustralia expects to release draft legislation that covers licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by 2024.\nRead More: ISIS Allies Used Crypto to Raise Millions: TRM Labs",

    "content": "Ethereum developers failed to get their new test network, Holesky, started on Friday, marring a technological milestone that was supposed to serve as a celebration of the first anniversary of last year’s historic “Merge” upgrade.\nWhile some validators were able to manually start the test network, there was a misconfiguration in one of the genesis files of the network, according to Ethereum core developers.\nAs a result, Ethereum core developers decided to postpone the launch for about two weeks, giving them time to regroup.\nThe episode represents a rare gaffe for Ethereum, which over the past year has managed to smoothly implement key upgrades, including the “Merge” a year ago and “Shapella” in April, all the while incorporating rapid growth in its fast-expanding ecosystem of secondary networks known as layer-2 blockchains.\nEthereum is the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin, but it's closely watched because it's the largest among those that can support smart contracts, which are strings of programming that can be embedded into the network to run functions and applications, similar to a computer.\nDevelopers can still use Goerli\nTest networks, or testnets, are clones of a blockchain, used to simulate transactions and test applications before they are deployed on a mainnet blockchain. Ethereum developers created the Holesky testnet to replace one of the blockchain’s current testnets, Goerli.\nThe Goerli testnet is still live, so developers can still test their applications on that network. Developers plan to sunset Goerli in early 2024.\nHolesky is supposed to ease some scaling issues for Ethereum, as developers are intended to allow for twice as many validators to join the network compared to mainnet.\n“It’s possible to resurrect the network with a fix, but we decided it’s probably cleaner to start fresh considering it’ll be a new network that’ll live for years,” said Parithosh Jayanthi, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation.\nHolesky is also supposed to be critical for Ethereum’s next hard fork, Dencun, in which proto-danksharding, a technical feature aimed at scaling the blockchain, is supposed to go live. Jayanthi told CoinDesk that the set back in Holesky’s launch is not supposed to affect the timing of Dencun. “This won’t affect Dencun at all,” he said.\nFriday’s launch was supposed to mark the first anniversary of the \"Merge,\" Ethereum’s historic event where it became a \"proof-of-stake\" blockchain and swapped out its old, energy-intensive \"proof-of-work\" model.\nRead more: Hello Holesky, Ethereum’s Newest Testnet",

    "summary": "Cosmos Hub is an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network. ATOM powers the Cosmos ecosystem of blockchains programmed to scale and interoperate with each other.",
    "content": "ATOM, the native coin of Cosmos Hub, a blockchain acting as an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network, is nursing moderate losses a day after Comos' founder Jae Kwon called community members to split the blockchain into two, with one observer hailing the potential hard fork as a bullish outcome for the investor community.\n\"Let's coordinate a split,\" Kwon said Sunday, following a decision by the Cosmos community to approve a proposal to reduce ATOM's inflation to 10% from 14%. Cosmos Hub is an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network.\nThe so-called proposal 848, approved with 41.1% support for the reduction from the participating voting power and 31.9% against it, said that ATOM's double-digit inflation rate represented overpayment by the Hub for security and disincentivized ATOM's use in decentralized finance. The approved change is projected to bring down Atom's annualized staking yield from approximately 19% to about 13.4%. Staking refers to locking coins in a blockchain in return for rewards.\nKwon, however, wasn't impressed and called for the hard fork.\n\"Despite our voting [against the plan]… 848 has ended up passing, something that isn't too surprising (though it would be good to know whether the later votes came from newly purchased ATOMs),\" Kwon said on X.\nKwon referred to the hard fork as AtomOne, which would fork the Cosmos Hub, calling for a final plan whereby the forked chain would support ATOM token along with the native ATOM1.\n\"I believe that the final plan should include an integration of $ATOM and $ATMO/$ATOM1 so that instead of mass selling $ATOM and collapsing it all, we allow participation from $ATOM, but what is in the README can be improved. Tokenomics people take a shot,\" Kwon said on X.\nAccording to X user \"John Galt,\" an expert on Cosmos and head of strategy at Stride Zone, a potential hard fork could resolve years of community infighting and bode well for ATOM token holders.\n\"A fork would be very bullish. For years, political tension has impeded the development of Cosmos Hub. Most notably when the ATOM 2.0 proposal was vetoed in the fall of 2022,\" Galt said on X. \"Without Jae's conservatism, Cosmos Hub could be more innovative.\"\nBesides, Galt expects the hard fork to lead to the biggest airdrop for ATOM and could result in a massive increase in trading volume for both ATOM and ATOM1 tokens.\nAirdrops involve blockchain-based projects and developers sending free tokens to the communities as part of a broader marketing initiative. When a chain splits, the native coin of the new blockchain is usually airdropped to token holders from the original blockchain.\n\"Jae is calling the new chain AtomOne (ATOM1). Most of the ATOM1 allocation would go to ATOM stakers pro-rata their amount. Unclear if liquid ATOM is included,\" Galt said.\nStill, as of writing, ATOM traded 3.5% lower on the day at $9.59, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency peeped above $10 over the weekend but failed to establish a foothold above the three-week-long resistance. The weakness perhaps stems from bitcoin, the industry leaders, struggling to get past the $38,000 mark.\n15:37 UTC: Mentions Cosmos Hub's role in the Cosmos network in the first para.",

That’s significantly lower than the last bull run, which bred over 4,000 millionaire wallets per day and over 2,000 wallets with a $10 million balance per day.\nThe slower pace might mean the bull run is still in the early stages, and the pace of inflows is yet to peak. The conclusion is consistent with market consensus that prices could rise to $150,000 and higher in the coming months due to continued inflows into the spot ETFs and the impending halving-induced supply reduction.\n“This [slower growth rate of millionaires] could be due to a few things: (1) New capital has yet to arrive in full force. (2) Large whales are taking profit as BTC hits new highs. (3) Whales are storing their holdings with custodians, rather than personal wallets,” Kaiko said in the weekly newsletter.\nRecently, the gap between the liquidity on the ask and bid sides of the order book within 2% of the market price has widened to nearly five times as usual, hinting at a buildup of limit orders on the sell side – a sign of investors looking to take profit near record highs.",

At Friday's close of $4,320.05, the S&P 500, the benchmark for risk assets worldwide, including cryptocurrencies, was down nearly 3% for the third quarter.\nThe equity risk premium, the gap between the S&P 500’s earnings yield and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, has declined to -0.58, the lowest since 2009, according to charting platform TradingView. The spread has averaged roughly 3.5 points since 2008.\nIn other words, the allure of investing in stocks and other risk assets has dimmed with safe-haven government bonds offering a relatively higher return. Treasury securities are regarded as risk free, given they are backed by the United States government, which has never defaulted on its debts. The 10-year yield, therefore, is considered a benchmark risk-free rate of return against which other returns from other assets are compared.\nThe difference between the S&P 500's dividend yield and the 10-year Treasury yield paints a similar picture. The spread has declined to -2.87, the lowest since July 2007.\nJuicy bond yields also mean less incentive to invest in bitcoin. Crypto propounders consider bitcoin a haven asset like digital gold, although historically, the cryptocurrency has been a pure play on liquidity, often acting as a lead indicator to stocks.\n\"Bitcoin is a non-yield bearing, risk-on asset. As such, it will be adversely affected by a high USD risk-free rate due to portfolio rebalancing,\" Alex McFarlane, co-founder of Keyring Network, said on LinkedIn.\n\"The suggestion that we can go forward ignoring rates markets and trade BTC as an orthogonal portfolio component doesn’t square unless BTC can offer a risk-free rate - which it cannot, unlike POS [Proof-of-stake],\" McFarlane added.\nThe S&P 500 earnings yield is the sum of the earnings per share of the index's component companies divided by the current index level. The dividend yield is the basic return an investor can expect to receive by investing in the index companies.\nThe spread between the earnings yield and the bond yield helps money managers assess the relative attractiveness of the two assets.",

    "summary": "Research firm RxR's blended Metcalfe law-centric valuation model, incorporating active user adoption of layer 2 scaling networks, suggests ether should trade at a market value of $275 billion.",
    "content": "Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is trading at a 27% discount to its fair value, according to analysis by RxR, a research-focused joint venture between Republic Crypto and Re7 Capital.\nRxR's fair value projection is based on a blended version of the Metcalfe law, which includes the active user base on the ever-growing Ethereum scaling networks and active users on the Ethereum mainnet to gauge the network's fair value. Traditional Metcalfe law models tend to focus only on the active user base on the mainnet.\nPer the Metcalfe law (ML), the value of the network is directly linked and proportional to the square of the number of users it has. Ether enables users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain, earn interest, and participate in network security through staking, store non-fungible tokens and much more. Thus, ether's value proposition has long been closely tied to Ethereum's network usage.\n\"Ethereum’s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum’s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,\" Lewis Harland, analyst at RxR, said in the research note published last week.\n\"The updated model, which does factor in these networks, puts ETH’s valuation at $275 billion (current MCAP trading at a 27% discount), assuming no further user growth in perpetuity,\" Harland added.\nEther's market cap looks undervalued compared to the RxR's ML Blended Model, represented by the red.\nIt's more reliable than the while line, representing the traditional ML model, which ignores the increasing activity on the layer 2 networks or offchain solutions built on the top of the mainnet to reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. In other words, ether is not necessarily overvalued, as the traditional ML Model suggests.\nLayer 2 has become one of the most exciting areas in the market, with key protocols finding their niche. Per IntoTheBlock, Coinbase's BASE has the most unique addresses and transactions, while Arbitrum dominates transaction volume and Optimism is focused on its superchain vision.\nIn two years, the total value locked in the layer 2 protocols has increased more than tripled to over $9 billion, according to data source L2Beat.\n\"A key change in April 2021 was when scaling networks started contributing to Ethereum’s blockspace at scale. For example, Curve, Sushiswap, Decentraland, and Aave launched on Polygon (PoS) between April and May 2021 - these collectively drove the total value-bridged to Polygon to $10 billion.\" Harland said.\n\"Fast forward to today and over 250 applications on Ethereum have a total value-locked of >$1m. Nearly 30 layer 2 networks have an aggregate TVL of $10 billion due to the advent of rollup-centric solutions.\" Harland added, stressing the importance of incorporating the layer 2 activity in the ML fair value models.",

    "summary": "EU-wide blockchain services could support the bloc’s pursuit of digital sovereignty, Mathieu Michel told CoinDesk.",
    "content": "Belgium will give Europe’s ambitious blockchain initiative a political push when it takes the EU Council presidency in January, the country’s digital minister said in an interview with CoinDesk.\nMathieu Michel has already shared his grand vision for an EU-wide digital infrastructure that – at the very least – could store records such as driving licenses and property titles on a common blockchain controlled by the bloc’s governments.\nKey to that plan is the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) initiative, which began in 2018 as a technical project. Michel said the goal is to rev up political support for it during Belgium’s six-month Council presidency and that eight member states are already on board.\n“In the coming months, what we will do is to propose to other European countries to be involved in the project or to use the project for application,” Michel said.\nThe Council gathers government ministers from the European Union’s 27 member states and is the bloc’s highest political entity.\nProlific regulation\nAccording to Michel, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology applications could be key to the EU’s pursuit of digital sovereignty, encompassing control over data and authority over cyberspace.\nWhen it comes to guardrails for the digital space, the EU has been prolific in recent years, introducing legislative plans for everything from crypto to artificial intelligence, data sharing, a digital euro and even the metaverse. In fact, with the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation finalized this year, the bloc is set to become the first major jurisdiction in the world to have a comprehensive regime for the digital asset space.\nEnough regulation, Michel says. Now, it’s time for Europe to put those digital innovations to good use.\nEU countries were told in 2020 how to join the EBSI blockchain network by setting up their own nodes. But to avoid data silos, applications built on it should be interoperable across member states – something Michel said blockchain can help achieve.\n“We are really bringing a lot of attention to privacy, but also transparency, control of the data. And with the blockchain, there is a technical aspect that can bring us that. And that's really, for example, the interoperability between the application in France, Italy and Spain,” Michel said.\nTo be first\nInviting political scrutiny to a technology project isn’t going to be a walk in the park. The EU’s big plans for a digital version of the euro have faced opposition from lawmakers in the bloc who are concerned about privacy implications and the expansion of government control.\nMichel assures a unified blockchain infrastructure won’t be designed to collect any new data from citizens.\n“Today, a lot of governments have data of the people, of the citizens. What we are talking about is a little bit of a paradigm shift,” he said, adding that the shift is in the way the government offers that data back to citizens.\nIt’s not mandatory to use blockchain, especially if it’s not going to help, Michel said, noting there is also a chance that blockchain tech could be replaced by something else altogether. Quantum computing, which promises ultra-fast problem-solving but is still some distance from coming to fruition, is already viewed as an existential threat to blockchain.\nBut that doesn’t mean the EU shouldn’t try, according to Michel.\n“If you look at the sovereignty of Europe, we were not the first at connectivity. We were not the first in cloud services. Here, with blockchain technology, we could try to be the first,” Michel said.\n“If we are not in advance, it means that we are already too late,” he added.",

    "content": "Q Protocol, which provides blockchain governance as a service to Web3 and decentralized autonomous organizations, will use the rules laid out by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)'s arbitration court to resolve disputes and enforce awards, Nicolas Biagosch, the protocol's co-initiator, told CoinDesk in an interview.\nThe protocol allows developers to build organizational constitutions that are enforced by smart contracts and include off-chain avenues for resolving disputes the code can't deal with. Q Protocol’s own constitution lays down the rules of the system, which includes resorting to the 100-year-old International Court of Arbitration.\nHistorically, dispute resolution has been a problem in DeFi. One example: A clash between Aragon Foundation, the Swiss entity that oversaw Aragon, and a group of activist investors who took interest in the project’s ANT token and multimillion-dollar treasury, led to the foundation winding down and handing its $155 million in assets to token holders.\n“We would have had a solution to the Aragon dispute,” Biagosch said.\nThe ICC rules are often used by entities as a way to conduct private arbitration because it tends to be quicker than nation-state-based jurisdictions.\n“We are in a position to administer matters submitted to us unless doing so would contravene the legal framework within which ICC operates,” Alexander G. Fessas, secretary general of the International Court of Arbitration, told CoinDesk in an interview. “I can confirm that the ICC International Court of Arbitration has already administered blockchain-related disputes.”\nDespite not being a first, the fact that disputes within the space of decentralized finance (DeFi) can use the framework offered by ICC, the world's leading arbitral institution for resolution lends the space unprecedented credibility.\n“Our mission is to ensure access to justice and the rule of law and our objective is to assist parties in resolving their disputes.” Fessas said. “It is good to see businesses in emerging industries like blockchain choose reputable institutional arbitration, and we expect to see more of this moving forward, particularly in specialized technologies.”\n“The participants in the Q ecosystem (13 projects have signed on to use the services) are parties to the private contract that is the Q Constitution,” Biagosch said. “They have agreed therein that the ICC Court of Arbitration shall, based on the Q Constitution and through its rules of procedure, be the only mechanism to resolve disputes, instead of and alternative to nation-state court systems.”\nBiagosch also said that the ICC will always reserve the right, based on its rules, to not hear the case. “One cannot force it into dispute resolution.”\nApart from dispute resolution through the ICC, decentralized discretionary decision-making and decentralized enforcement of rules beyond code-is-law are other aspects of Q Protocol’s services. The Q Protocol mainnet started operations in March 2022. In addition to the projects signed on to use the governance services, as many as 123 DAOs have built their organization on Q, which is another service available on the platform.",

    "content": "What On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nLayer 1 blockchain Sui has experienced a sharp increase in inflows this month, a spike that has seen it overtake Cardano, Near and Aptos in terms of total value locked (TVL).\nThe network, which was built by former Meta (META) employees, now has over $593 million in capital locked across various decentralized finance (DeFI) protocols, more than double its total at the turn of the year when it had $211 million, DefiLlama data shows.\nData published by wormholescan.io, which tracks the flow of funds through the cross-chain bridge Wormhole, shows that $310 million had been bridged to Sui from Ethereum in the past 30 days.\nSui is often compared to Aptos as they are both built using Move, a programming language that was originally developed at Meta to power the Diem blockchain.\nSui experienced a turbulent start after it debuted on Binance’s launchpad in May last year. SUI, as its native token, nosedived 68% in the first five months of trading. This came to a crescendo in October when Sui founders were accused of manipulating token supply, claims they quickly dismissed.\nHowever, Sui soon found its stride after a wave of inscription-related activity. First seen on Bitcoin during its recent NFT phase, inscriptions are a way of recording arbitrary data on the blockchain without the use of smart contracts.\nOn Dec. 22, Sui produced 13.8 million blocks, with transactions per second (TPS) reaching a peak of 6,000. In contrast to other layers 1s, like Ethereum, gas prices during this high traffic phase decreased, according to a Sui blog post. According to Suiexplorer, there are currently 106 validators operating 413 nodes to secure the Sui blockchain.\nThis buoyed the confidence of developers and investors as both the SUI token price and on-chain TVL increased in the following weeks. The two largest protocols on Sui are Scallop Lend and Navi Protocol, two lending platforms that have both seen TVL quadruple since the turn of the year.\nSUI is currently trading at $1.80, having risen by 131% since Jan. 1, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 index, which is up by 10% in the same period.",

    "content": "Newly-launched modular blockchain Celestia has experienced a slow start in terms of on-chain activity, but that hasn't reduced the appetite of traders who have spurred a speculative rally for its native TIA token to $6.30, 200% higher than when it debuted at around $2.10 two weeks ago.\nTIA's rise doesn't correlate to an uptick in blockchain usage; though the Celestia blockchain facilitated 350,000 transactions in the first two days following its launch, it has only added another 160,000 transactions since then, according to MintScan.\nBy comparison, rival modular blockchain Arbitrum has averaged between 550,000 and 920,000 daily transactions over the past seven days, Arbiscan data shows.\nAnother metric to assess the scalability of blockchains is transactions per second (TPS). Celestia is currently totaling 0.13 TPS. Arbitrum, meanwhile has a daily average of 8.01 TPS, according to L2Beat.\nIt's worth noting that as Celestia only rolled out a fortnight ago and adoption is not expected to match that of Arbitrum, which has been operational since May, 2021, but it is now facing competition from industry heavyweights like NEAR, which has joined the race with Celestia to provide data availability services to Ethereum rollups.\nData availability \"allows network nodes to download, store, and make transaction information accessible for verification,\" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at FundStat, in a note earlier this month.\nDespite a lack of immediate demand for its data availability functionality, Celestia's tokenomics have caught the attention of traders. Just 141 million tokens of the 1 billion hard cap are circulating, with the majority of the total supply being locked up until October 2024 and October 2026. Trading volume for TIA is around $900 million over the past 24 hours, exceeding the market cap of all tokens in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThe rally can be compared to Aptos, which like Celestia issued its APT token in the form of an airdrop when it launched last year. APT rocketed to a $2.9 billion market cap after its release despite the total value locked (TVL) on the blockchain being just $50 million at the time.",

    "content": "French soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain said it will become a network validator for the Chiliz Chain blockchain that hosts its PSG fan tokens, and use the money it generates to buy them back on a regular basis.\nSports clubs have dipped their toes in crypto over the years through the creation of fan tokens, which can be used for sports memorabilia and experiences, however this is the first time a club is getting involved as a blockchain validator. Validators are entities that manage blockchain nodes, securing the network through functions including transaction verification and smart-contract authorization. In exchange, validators generate revenue from running a node.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nThe club, currently leading France's Ligue 1 competition, introduced its fan token in September 2018. The token now has a market cap of $28 million, according to CoinMarketCap data. The buy-back program will allow PSG to \"regularly refresh\" its fan token reserves and help build a sustainable digital economy around them, Chiliz said.\n\"We will optimize our future engagements for network effects, amplifying the value and revenue each stakeholder can generate and experience within this new digital economy,\" Pär Helgosson, Paris Saint-Germain's head of Web3, said in a statement.\nThe Chiliz native token (CHZ) rose by 10% to $0.133 on the news with its market cap rising to $1.15 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\nOther big-name soccer clubs with tokens on Chiliz include FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus, Arsenal, Inter Milan and AC Milan.\nParis Saint-Germain also announced that it will host a hackathon event at its Parc Des Princes in the coming months in an event that will be co-hosted by Chiliz.\nUPDATE (Feb. 22, 13:15 UTC): Adds CHZ price reaction.",

Convex is a popular protocol that allows users to earn yields from the stablecoin swap service Curve Finance.\nThe Domain Name Service (DNS) translates website names that users type into the internet's native numeric address coding.

    "summary": "While the financial industry’s eyes are on crypto, blockchains are already making major changes.",
    "content": "Use the word “blockchain” in a conversation and the topic will likely gravitate to one of a handful of topics prominent in the news, like cryptocurrencies, the metaverse and Web3.\nTheoretical, next-generation technology trends tend to dominate technology discussions. Blockchains have spawned entirely new asset classes for investors in cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and they will power a new generation of innovations built on nebulous concepts like metaverse and Web3.\nBut the real power of blockchain will first be felt in more conventional areas, according to Kieran James-Lubin, CEO of BlockApps. BlockApps is a blockchain technology firm focused on real-world implementations of the technology to help businesses run more efficient and secure processes.\n“You hear something different from most blockchain people. Maybe it’s a personality thing, but I think the greatest promise for blockchain technology is in improving the world as it is today,” said James-Lubin. “It’s less about creating a whole new world on a blockchain for all of us to inhabit, or all of these interesting new asset classes.”\nYou're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.\nPractical applications of blockchain already\nBlockApps looks for transactions where there is insufficient trust and transparency. To start, James-Lubin has found particular opportunity in the food industry, where there’s increased focus among consumers and restaurants on knowing where food comes from.\nUsing a blockchain, BlockApps can help food producers and consumers track where their food has been and what processes it has undergone, from seed to table.\n“We’re starting to see more demand from the consumer side for transparency into what’s happening in supply chains, and this phenomenon started with food,” James-Lubin said. “In the grocery store, you may see labels saying things like product from Argentina or Australia, or organic, and people used to take the retailer’s word for it. Now they want to know what it actually means – which farms did the food come from, what has happened to these products along the way.”\nRead more: What Is Blockchain Technology?\nBlockApps provides similar services for environmental and social governance (ESG), offering a blockchain application that helps track carbon footprints and offsets throughout a value or supply chain.\nIn yet another application, BlockApps uses blockchain to help the city of Reno, Nevada, track and maintain information on historic properties.\n“In some cases, they had been using sort of an all-email system to keep track of all of this, but now they’ve digitized all of their information and on the blockchain the record is immutable,” James-Lubin said. “It’s an interesting use case that impacts their day-to-day operations.”\nJames-Lubin points out that there are a couple of trillion blockchain-native assets in the crypto space, but over $500 trillion in traditional assets are still waiting to be tokenized.\nFuture applications of blockchain in crypto\nJames-Lubin knows cryptocurrencies are an important innovation of blockchain technology.\n“They’re amazing,” he said. “One slightly cynical way to look at it, though, is that if you remove regulation as a barrier, even for a few years, and allow programmable financial services, you end up seeing a lot of rapid innovation – some of it unsavory, some of it fascinating.”\nNFTs, though not precisely an asset class, are another useful blockchain innovation, according to James-Lubin, as they may allow for new business models involving long-running residuals to artists, creators and publishers.\nWatch: How NFT Royalties Favor Artists\nNear-term applications of blockchain\nEventually, much of the world’s wealth will reside on, or be tracked by, blockchains, but one of the first areas to be impacted will be real property, according to James-Lubin.\n“Most of that wealth will be land, land titles and real property,” he said. “If you think about the experience of purchasing and owning a home, the way we manage those records on a municipal and state level is archaic. There’s a sense of urgency to apply a more transparent, real-time system to these assets, and blockchain solves a lot of those problems.”\nRead more: How to Buy a House With Crypto\nBlockchain also creates a useful settlement layer on which to trade traditional assets more efficiently. While publicly traded stocks and some bonds are already easily and efficiently traded, other assets such as private securities and other forms of debt are often traded in opaque and inefficient manners.\nFurthermore, the process to invest in private funds and securities is often time and resource consuming, a process blockchains can help facilitate via automation.\n“Right now, public markets work pretty well. In the long term, blockchain will be applied to them. But in the nearer term, there are certain niches where there isn’t good market infrastructure, and that’s where the technology will take hold first,” said James-Lubin.",

    "content": "CoinDesk announces our 2022 ranking of the 50 universities with the biggest impact on blockchain. We examined each of 240 schools based on metrics that include the number and influence of its research publications, the number of courses, degrees, conferences, clubs and industry partnerships or grants, where graduates get jobs, its reputation and many other measurements.\nThis piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week\nFor more on the methodology, including details of these metrics, read Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: CoinDesk's Methodology. For a brief profile of each of our 50 outstanding schools, click on each of the names below. And to get insight and analysis on what our data reveal about the biggest changes regionally and across the globe concerning blockchain research, and what that might indicate about the regulatory temperature for blockchain, see The Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Where Is Research Having The Biggest Impact?\nRead more about how we defined and measured \"scholarly impact,\" \"campus blockchain offerings,\" \"employment and industry outcomes\" and \"academic reputation.\"\nCoinDesk embarked on this months-long project even as well-known rankings of universities are being scrutinized, especially after Columbia University's data was called into question on the U.S. News and World Report's (USNWR) 2022 and 2023 lists.\nOur methodology, while not perfect, avoids some of the problems massive university rankings often do. CoinDesk pulled its own data from publicly available databases and the websites of the universities themselves, rather than relying on self-reported responses from our sample of 240 schools. While our data retrieval method could be incomplete, it's unlikely it could be manipulated.\nWe also had to reflect on the meaning of ranking universities for their research and pedagogy in the emerging technology of blockchain. Our readers are unlikely to be teens – or their parents – looking for the best schools to attend as undergraduates. We know our audience to be older and with jobs, whether in crypto or a related field, or not. So why rank universities for our audience? For one reason, fair or not, universities are graduating the people who will be working in blockchain for years to come. Employers may find our research useful. For another, we measured whether schools offered graduate degrees and non-degree certificates, and included those details in each of our stories for the crypto curious who want to take their education further.\nFinally, taking one of the most traditional institutions in the world for measuring professional success, the university, and measuring how it is adapting to teach and study a transformative emerging technology, is illuminating. For instance, the tiny nation of Singapore, which covers just 283 square miles (733 sq. km) and a 2021 population of 6 million people (similar to Johannesburg), had two of its universities in this year's top 10.\nThis result may be due to the city-state's crypto-friendly regulatory environment (though that stance may be undergoing a change). But it also may reveal something positive about blockchain generally.\n\"Singapore is punching way above its weight on the global stage,\" said MIT researcher Reuben Youngblom, who advised CoinDesk on the methodology for these rankings. \"It's a fun commentary on what blockchain is capable of, being somewhat of an equalizer.\"\n\"At this point in these rankings, something like adding one class could add a significant bump,\" he said. \"Adding a degree program would have a huge impact. It speaks to how nascent this field is in education.\"\nOur rankings are an opportunity to take a step back from the unrelenting news and attention-grabbing events of this fast-moving industry to provide yet another lens for looking at the crypto universe as a whole, and taking stock.\nThe CoinDesk Best Universities for Blockchain 2022 was produced by Cathy Choo, data researcher and analyst, and Joe Lautzenhiser, editorial researcher and strategist, in consultation with Reuben Youngblom, lecturer/researcher at Stanford University/MIT, with tremendous assistance from the editorial staff of CoinDesk and especially Trista Xinyi Luo, features and opinion intern, and Kurt Christenson, photo editor.",

    "summary": "Taiwan Digital Minister Audrey Tang sees the transparency of blockchain technology as a lynchpin of good governance.",
    "content": "Meet Audrey Tang, the woman who beat COVID-19. She’s too modest to put it that way, of course. The Digital Minister of Taiwan is quick to say that “I’m just the face,” and that the real credit belongs to the people of Taiwan, who used a mix of open-source tech, crowdsourcing and blockchain-inspired innovation to develop a contract-tracing system that people actually used, keeping coronavirus cases low.\nIn one remarkable stretch, Taiwan went 200 days without a COVID-19 case, and without China-style lockdowns. The secret sauce? Thanks to privacy-protecting encryption, citizens were happy to scan QR codes and “check in” at every restaurant, store, bar or cafe. They did this without revealing their personal data. It worked so well that Taiwan reduced the contract tracing cycle to an astonishing 24 minutes.\nIt’s an unorthodox system, and Tang is anything but orthodox. She is many things: A genius who dropped out of school at the age of eight to focus on computer programming (your move, Marc Zuckerberg); a legendary developer in the open-source community; a hacktivist who helped the revolutionary “Sunflower movement” come to power in Taiwan; the nation’s youngest-ever minister; the nation’s first transgender minister; the nation’s first “minister without portfolio” (giving her a sweeping scope) and a believer in “radical transparency” – all of Tang’s communications are available to see online.\nBlockchain plays a role in this. “I learned about fully homomorphic encryption [an encryption method that preserves privacy] by reading the latest research that came from the distributed ledger community,” says Tang, who prefers to use the word “ledger” over “blockchain.” She implemented tools that let Taiwan citizens quickly come to a consensus – not just about macro issues that you vote on every few years (such as who should lead the country), but on hyper-specific, real-time, micro issues such as “What is the best QR scanner to use for a contact tracing system?”\nRead More: Can Taiwan Become Asia’s Crypto Haven? Not Yet\nAudrey Tang is open sourcing and crowdsourcing democracy, and it’s working. Bonus? She figured out how to beat misinformation campaigns – using a strategy called “humor over rumor” – and suspects the model could work in the United States.\nUltimately, the system that Tang helped position, which she calls the Taiwan Model, helps us crack the “seeming dilemma of preserving privacy and human rights on one side, and tackling structural wicked problems” on the other side. Usually it’s either-or. Or as Tang puts it, “Too often it's phrased as a zero-sum game … and Taiwan is proving that no, you can actually have both.”\nHere's how she did it.\nNote: This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Thanks to Tang’s policy of radical transparency, you can read the entire, unabridged conversation at her website.\nWhat have been your most important goals since you assumed the role of Digital Minster?\nI'm a “lowercase minister,” a digital minister, meaning that I don't give orders and I don't take orders either. And the entire idea is that what matters is to work with the people, and not for the people. “For the people” means that maybe you know better than people do, right? But “with the people” means that we need to constantly build the mechanisms, the spaces.\nWhat do you mean by the mechanisms?\nToll-free numbers, a daily press conference and many other things to make sure that people know exactly what's going on without having to invest a lot of research by themselves. To build a ladder of expertise on anything that might be controversial or require public input.\nSo, of course, the [response to the] pandemic is the [best known example.] I think only we in Taiwan are still doing COVID-zero with Omicron. I don't think anyone else is doing that now. … We've not instilled a single day of lockdown. It's literally based on people voluntarily participating in data collaboratives, such as contact tracing, because they know that when they scan the QR code their phone number or nothing about them will go to the venue owner, so it's privacy-preserving.\nA lot of it actually came from the zk-based [zero knowledge-based proofs] research from the Web 3 field, right? I learned about fully homomorphic encryption by reading the latest research that came from the distributed ledger [blockchain] community. But then we put it into use, because people understand that if it saves their time and makes them feel safer, then they are willing to participate and also contribute to make a better QR code scanner that rejects any other QR code and so on.\nWhat else is involved?\nBasically, all the components in the current contact tracing get a lot of input from not just the social sector, but also the private sector – like our leading antivirus company Trend Micro, or LINE, which is our equivalent of WhatsApp in Taiwan. So they all got into this ecosystem of shortening contact tracing from 24 hours to 24 minutes. And people can reverse-audit in the past four weeks [to see] which contact tracing, which municipality have looked at your data. So there's reverse accountability to ensure that it's deleted after four weeks.\nRead More: This Taiwanese Fintech Wants to Bridge the World Using Stablecoins\nWe’ve built similar relationships with the data collaboratives to counter infodemics as well, which is less widely reported. So my hope is to keep this “With the People” paradigm going strong, so people don’t have to give up when seeing the seeming-dilemma of preserving privacy and human rights on one side and tackling structural-wicked problems, like the [coronavirus] pandemic or info-demic, on the other side. Too often it's phrased as a zero-sum game, like there's a dial here somewhere, right? And Taiwan is proving that, no, you can actually have both if you work with the people, not just for the people.\nYou mentioned how you work to counter “infodemics.” What do you mean by this exactly?\nSo, parallel to the pandemic is the infodemic. The thing that reduced the effectiveness of NPIs [non-pharmaceutical interventions] in other jurisdictions. Like if the people believe that there’s a 5G antenna in a mask. [Laughs.]\nOh, so misinformation campaigns?\nOr intentional disinformation campaigns. [Or] information manipulation leading up to elections, and so on. Of course, the U.S., being an advanced democracy, doesn’t have that.\n[Both laugh.] We need you! We need you here in the U.S.! Okay, but seriously, clearly the United States does have, as you say, an “infodemic.” The U.S. has a big problem there. Can you elaborate on the tools you put in place in Taiwan to stop this?\nSo we call it humor over rumor. It's very simple. [By analogy], the idea is how some vaccines are made. You take a trending viral virus variant, take its mRNA strands, and put it into a different spike protein configuration and then release it. So it gets even more viral than the [original] virus itself.\nOkay, I think I’m following …\nThe idea is that we have this trending scoreboard of which “viruses of the mind” are getting the highest R-value [a measure of how fast a virus spreads.] … So suppose we know this [misinformation] has an R-value of 10. Like, on average, one person spreads this information to 10 other people. So we focus on that … and then we take some mRNA strands [by analogy], and then we put out a really funny meme.\nWhat’s an example?\nBefore the pandemic, there was viral disinformation that said, “The state is going to fine you $1 million if you perm your hair twice or more a week.” Do you believe it? But it's actually viral. It’s trending.\nAnd then our premier, within two hours … wrote this extremely funny meme where we quote the disinformation and say it's not true.\nThen the premier, who is in his 70s now, posted a photo of him as a young man with a lot of hair. And the young man said, \"So it's not true. I used to have hair. I would not punish people who look like my youth.\" And a fine print that says, \"What you've seen in the rumors are actually a labeling requirement for the warnings that the labels of the manufacturer of those hair products, they must be printed on that bottle. So the fine goes to the manufacturer or the bottler if they don't put in a warning label.\"\nRead More: Safeguarding Our Privacy in an Age of Transparency\nThe “viral payload” is the premier, as he looks now, with almost no hair, and then with a hair blower, and said, \"But if you perm your hair many times a week, it will not damage your bank account, it will damage your hair. Your hairstyle may become my hairstyle.” So he makes fun of himself, and it's very convincing.\nThat went absolutely viral. Much more viral than the disinformation. And the people who laughed about it, who vented their outrage, literally became immune when they see the original disinformation. They don't spread it anymore ... because they have already vented.\nAh, I get it. You're giving an outlet for conspiracy theories and absurdist rumors? A safe, healthy, innocent outlet. And once that thirst has been slaked, they're not as likely to fall prey to the actual rumors. So your team is intentionally creating fantastical funny rumors that are not true, and hoping they’ll go viral?\nExactly. Pneumatic engineering. Yes.\nIncredible. And with the “R scores,” you’re tracking both the real rumors – the “viruses of the mind” – and the fake, humor rumors?\nThe vaccines. Yes.\nDo you think that would work in the U.S.?\nYes, definitely. And all it takes is a kind of self-deprecating humor from the leadership.\nThat’s so interesting. On a related note, I understand that “radical transparency” is a foundational value of yours. Why is that so important to you, and how can it benefit society?\nBecause it enables timely consensus, and the ledger [blockchain] community of all communities understands this. If you don't get a high bandwidth in terms of transaction per second and a low latency for a consensus, well, there really is no reason why people should invest in the governance equations, because whatever they propose will take forever to be ratified.\nAnd, of course, in open source you can always fork, but that's not feasible for many communities. You can't really fork the community relationships with you, right? If it's that easy, Facebook would have been forked like a trillion times by now, right? So the right to fork, while fundamental, and I respect the software freedoms which is essentially the right to fork, is just the right to exit.\nBut what we're building with timely, real-time, radical transparency is the right to voice. The right to matter in governance settings, in a way that doesn't squander your own cognitive resources and can actually ripple through the consent of the governed. To build “consensus of the governed,” so to speak.\nWhat do you mean exactly?\nIn an epidemic setting, this is even more important. Because if mask distribution, or contact tracing, or vaccination only works in some pockets of population or some pockets of cities … then it creates internal division that drives the party apart. And we've seen many other jurisdictions where the national and the municipal governments were on completely different sides. And if they do that a couple of times, people lose all trust in the counter epidemic measures, because their mayor said a different thing from the chancellor, or from the premier, and so on.\nWe can definitely relate to this in the U.S. …\nBut if, through this real-time, open API, the cabinet minister can very easily say, “Yeah, the municipal version is correct. It's been proven by the open-street map community. There's no qualms about that.” And then 24 hours later, we integrate that into the consensus. So then it's always a backward-compatible soft fork. There is always a right to fork in democratic policies. But the fork is soft, meaning that it's backward compatible. And the mainline has a timely way to integrate, meaning that we just abandon our original errors of our ways and simply say that the software is now the new reality. Maybe we call it London or something.\nLet me try and summarize. So it's the extremely efficient, real-time communication that you've instilled that allows a constant understanding of what people want?\nThat's right.\nAnd the people, by having their voice clearly heard, don’t necessarily have governance. It’s not like, if 80% of the people in Taiwan approve of a certain solution it’s law. It’s not a direct democracy. But it’s a clear demonstration of what they want?\nIt's agenda. It's agenda-setting power.\nRight. Got it. But I’m still a little fuzzy on what you mean by the “soft fork”?\nYeah. So once the agenda is known, not just to the premier or the minister but a crowdsourced agenda is known for everyone, then instead of just the government's contractors delivering solutions, actually, everyone is free to experiment in their vicinity on solutions.\nAh, I’m starting to get it …\nLast May [2020] when we had our real first [COVID-19] wave … there were literally more than 20 contact tracing solutions going on in just three days. … Pretty much all the contact tracing makers are on the same [communication] channel, and we are just working very diligently so that within a couple of days we converged on the SMS-based, open standard QR code contact tracing where everyone can implement their own QR code scanner but nobody keeps personal data. And that was the consensus of the contact tracing tool makers.\nRead More: Crypto Industry Mobilizes Against Proposed EU Transparency Rules\nSo I didn't program the tool myself, but I did what we call a “reverse-procurement.” The specification is defined by the internet civic community. It's taken as a national standard, so that we then take that to ask our vendors and contractors in the private sector to build to the spec that those small-scale experiments have already validated.\nIt's pretty much the only working way. So crowdsource agenda setting is one, but open innovation co-creation is the other. And these two working together is like a double diamond, right? You get to diverge, converge, diverge, converge very quickly.\nHow do you feel knowing that you saved a lot of lives? As I understand it, you are the key figure motivating this open-source massive experiment on a national scale. No other country has done this. You’ve trounced COVID-19 thanks to this.\nI think we call it the Taiwan model, so the \"you\" is definitely plural. You is not just me. I'm just the face, right? The spokesperson of a huge community of civic tech and government tech.\nBut I think it is really a model. It's not just for the pandemic and the infodemic. It could also be used to fight climate change, or all sorts of inequity and injustice that people previously thought must result in the loss of one or the other.\nAfter they got introduced into this way of thinking, then they can actually design solutions that work for the true betterment of next generations and so on. Because it's much easier to take the plurality into account if you know, as a fact, that 8,000 people starting a movement online with a popular hashtag is actually a force of good, instead of a force to disrupt. …\nSo it's a really good thing that we can show those concrete solutions that, as you've said, have saved people's lives. Because then people think, \"Oh, if we can actually get the COVID and especially Omnicron [variant] to net-zero, then maybe it's not hard to tackle the carbon dioxide thing, to get it to net-zero.\" It instills optimism into all the sectors.\nI enjoyed this. Congrats on your success.\nThank you. [Raises hand in Vulcan salute.] Live long and prosper.\nRead More: What If We Get Online Privacy Right? A Glimpse of 2035",

In order for a vote to migrate the network to pass, a two-thirds majority was needed.\nSome 6,177 community members voted in favor of the move by staking over 12 million HNT. Just 1,270 voted against it.\nDevelopers behind Helium proposed the migration to Solana to help scale the protocol through more efficient transactions as well as interoperability.

Once the migration is complete, a new version of the Helium Wallet App will be made available. Additionally, the Helium layer 1 blockchain history will remain public. Users will be able to access the new application by updating their current wallet app. HNT holders can also use other wallets within the Solana ecosystem, such as Phantom or Solflare.\nHowever, although the votes show overwhelming support for the migration, not everyone has been on board with the network’s choice to move to Solana.

Although the number is off slightly from the early January high of 80%, it is still well above the peak of 60% observed during the height of the late 2017 bull run. The data shows a significant amount of wealth has been distributed from speculators or traders to investors during the past three and a half years.\nThe report titled \"The Elusive Bottom\" defines long-term investors as wallets holding the cryptocurrency for at least six months.\nSpeculators are typically sophisticated participants or retail traders who purchase assets for short periods of time and employ strategies to profit from short-term price gyrations. Speculators and traders are more sensitive to macroeconomic factors such as changes in the Fed's policy.\nBitcoin has fallen by more than 50% to $20,000 this year, primarily because of the Fed's decision to withdraw liquidity to combat high inflation.\nThe liquidity exodus has exposed faulty risk management practices in the crypto universe, forcing many trading firms and miners – those responsible for minting coins – to offload their holdings to stay solvent. Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that had billions of dollars in assets under management earlier this year, recently went insolvent.

Even I didn’t know I’m going to be there.”\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\n“There” was Blockchain Economy Istanbul, held July 27-28 and billed as Eurasia’s largest blockchain conference. Conference organizers said 3,000 people showed up along with 50 speakers, including Alex Bornyakov, the face of war-torn Ukraine’s crypto movement.\nRead More: Ukraine Bought Weapons, Drones With Crypto Donations\nBut the absences were noticeable. Big players like exchanges Binance, FTX and Coinbase (COIN) didn’t have exhibitions. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao did appear in Turkey – via a virtual meeting with the country’s finance minister on the same day as the conference. At a conference touted as the “meeting place for the world’s top crypto companies and blockchain entrepreneurs,” four fireside chats, six panels and 20 keynote addresses were dotted with empty seats, according to attendees.\nGiven that the crypto bear market was still rampaging, no-shows should probably have been expected.\n“The way they marketed it paints a different picture,” said Tony Dhanjal, the head of tax at Koinly, a company that helps track and report crypto taxes. “When you look at it empirically, that did not look like 3,000 people – rather, no more than 1,000. Perhaps, the lack of attendance was reflected in the fact we are in a bear market.”\nOthers like Didi Wiboonma, chief communications officer of Bitazza.com, praised the diversity in the attendance but said she had come “a long way from Thailand and so was expecting a little bit more advanced content.”\n“The conference is less crowded, welcoming and interactive than I anticipated,” said Kimia Hosseinpour, 25, who came with higher expectations after quitting her job as a mechanical engineer, selling her car and vacating her apartment in Washington, D.C., so she could travel. “I enjoyed some of the panels more than the walking around.”\n“One may have seen dotted empty seats in the main hall because the attendees were in the expo area,” said organizers from Teklip, while pointing to the post-event report that reflected a sharp decline in onsite attendance post lunch.\n“Attendees decide for themselves whether they would like to listen to speeches or explore exhibitions and network. Also, the smoking area at the entrance of the venue was crowded the whole time. The workshop was also carried out.”\nAmong speakers, long-time Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor was the biggest draw, but India-based Fahad Th, an attendee, told CoinDesk he would not have turned up if he knew Saylor would only speak virtually.\n“We had the symbol of a phone next to Saylor’s name indicating he would be on video,” said Servi Aman, the event’s head from Teklip, an advertising and media company.\nBut there was another lesson lurking: Crypto is thriving in Turkey. Eurasia as a region doesn’t have many prominent crypto hubs. Istanbul, the region's financial capital for centuries, is emerging as one and people there showed plenty of enthusiasm, even if crypto bigshots weren’t in attendance at the massive Hilton Istanbul Bomonti Hotel.\nThe smoking area at the hotel's convention floor reflected that local buzz. At any given point in time, with smokes in hand and an idea on their lips, dozens of Turkey’s crypto enthusiasts reflected on protocols, pitched journalists, and discussed partnerships.\nSeveral announcements made at the event indicated what was visible in the exhibitor hall: an obliviousness to the crypto bear market, especially when there was a Turkish connection.\nCrypto exchange AAX announced its expansion in Turkey, appointing a crypto lawyer and ex-Binance official, Anadolu Aydınlı, as its country director. AAX’s confidence in Turkey was based on a study it commissioned that found 16% of Turkey’s population – approximately 13.6 million people – own bitcoin (BTC).\nThe paparazzi crowded Engin Altan Düzyatan, the star of the globally acclaimed series “Resurrection: Ertuğrul” – the Turkish “Game of Thrones” – as he announced he’s now the co-founder of a metaverse game based on the show titled “Medieval Empires: Ertugrul.”\nA child-like curiosity was in the air, best exemplified by students from the blockchain community of Cankaya University, based in Turkey’s capital, Ankara.\nThe students sealed an impromptu partnership with QAN, a Quantum resistant layer 1 hybrid blockchain. The deal included QAN providing guest lectures and starting a talent management program at the university.\nOne young man stood out for not being where he should be – in school. A 15-year-old crypto trader named Efe Kelemci came to Istanbul to achieve his larger aim to educate teens to be financially independent, something he started doing through crypto at age 13 with $1,000 he saved up from birthdays. In Istanbul, he attempted to take it a step further, seeking partnerships for his upcoming decentralized finance (DeFi) venture.\nIt didn’t matter to Kelemci that crypto big shots didn’t come. Local enthusiasm, and the presence of notable even if not the biggest companies such as Gari Network, Uphold and KuCoin were enough to satisfy his youthful exuberance.\nCORRECTION (Aug. 23, 2022 10:30 UTC) Makes clear in eighth paragraph that event attendee Kimia Hosseinpour's reason for changes in her lifestyle were so that she could travel. In seventh paragraph, corrects Didi Wiboonma's job title, having given CoinDesk the wrong business card.",

Bitcoin has climbed the past three weeks to change hands toward the upper end of a $20,000 to $24,000 range.\n\"BTC's resilience above $20,000 did see bulls pushing for more upside, especially after a successful retest of that range,\" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote CoinDesk. \"However, we are yet to witness the breakout above $25,000, which could see BTC moving quickly toward the $29,000-$30,000 range.\"\nEther was recently down about 1.6% over the previous day to trade at about $1,950. The second-largest crypto by market cap behind bitcoin has been lately gaining ground at an even faster pace than bitcoin and topped $2,000 for a second consecutive day on Saturday before declining. Ether's surge has come as the hotly anticipated Merge, which will transform the Ethereum protocol from proof-of-work to a faster, less energy-sapping model looms closer. Ethereum completed its third and final test environment network (testnet) merge, Goerli last Wednesday.\nMost other altcoins were in the red in late weekend trading with OP and QUICK off about 8% and 7%, respectively, although popular meme coin SHIB was up over 30% and DOGE jumped more than 10%.\nEquity markets\nCrypto gains have largely tracked stocks, which have also been regaining ground in recent weeks after a dismal first seven months. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, closed Friday up 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, as investors continued to savor Wednesday's unexpectedly favorable consumer price index (CPI) showing July prices rising at a lower rate than the previous month. Markets are hopeful the data will allow the U.S. central bank to ratchet back its next interest rate hike to 50 basis points, a less aggressive approach than it has been following.\nThe Nasdaq and S&P have risen four consecutive weeks, their longest weekly upturn since last November. The Nasdaq has gained 20% since June to escape its lengthiest bear market run since 2008.\nCrypto news\nMeanwhile, crypto industry news was mixed on Friday. India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), a government agency that is responsible for probing financial crimes, froze assets worth 3.7 billion rupees ($46.4 million) at crypto exchange Vauld, it said in a statement. The U.S. Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) accused an Ohio man of running a $12 million bitcoin Ponzi scheme, filing a cease-and-desist order over allegations he scammed investors interested in digital assets.\nBut the mood was upbeat at Canada's largest blockchain conference last week amid a keynote address by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, a hackathon and panels.\nDiPasquale noted warily that current macroeconomic uncertainties will continue to cloud bitcoin's future pricing. \"It may be too early to think that the macroeconomic woes are behind us,\" he said. \"This month's closing and the entirety of September will be key for the crypto market on account of a few factors, including the next [Federal Open Market Committee] as well as the anticipated Ethereum Merge. If both BTC and ETH can manage to retain their gains and consolidate until the end of September, we could see a bigger rally leading into Q4.\"\nBiggest Gainers\nBiggest Losers\nInsights\nS. Korea Play-to-Earn Bans Likely to Remain in Place\nBy Sam Reynolds\nWalking the halls of Korea Blockchain Week, it would be hard to miss the advertising for play-to-earn games. Dozens of companies attended the conference to show off new play-to-earn games that they hope will be the next Axie Infinity.\nThere’s only one problem: Technically these games are illegal in South Korea.\nAs CoinDesk has reported before, converting game tokens into cash – a staple of GameFi – has been banned in South Korea for longer than blockchain has existed. Article 32 of South Korea’s Gaming Industry Promotion Act banning the monetization of gaming tokens that became law in 2004 as the arcade game Seatalk (바다이야기) swept the nation. There’s also Article 28 of the Act, which prohibits speculative acts, gambling and free gifts in-game.\nSouth Korean authorities have used the laws to order Apple’s App Store and Google Pay store to remove Play-to-Earn games.\nWhile some stakeholders expect a reversal of this ban under the crypto-friendly Yoon Suk-Yeol administration, this hasn’t been signaled to the industry. In Seoul, CoinDesk gaming company sources who are familiar with regulatory affairs said the regulatory guidance they’ve received from authorities remains the status quo. There’s no indication, they said, that change is coming.\nIf something were to happen it would be incremental. Regulators in-country, still spooked by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, tend to be conservative and prefer to move slowly.\nSlow change?\n“Play-to-earn also comes in many different forms and If the lift of the ban happens, I think it will be partial,” Oleg Smagin, a senior crypto finance manager at Seoul-based Post Voyager, a GameFi service developer, told CoinDesk. “For example, the government can start by allowing free-to-play [non-fungible token] games with play-to-earn elements, especially as big South Korean gaming studios believe that introducing non-fungible tokens in the games is less risky compared to launching fully crypto-backed games with a fungible asset as a currency.”\nSmagin also thinks the government would look at the track record of success these play-to-earn titles have had overseas when making its decision.\nAs the South Korean government is doing that, it will no undoubtedly consider how other regulators are approaching GameFi, and its $8.5 billion market cap, when determining its next steps.\nIn Thailand, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission urged investors to be cautious citing the high volatility of the tokens and hacking risk. But those two risk factors are old news to anyone remotely familiar with cryptocurrency.\nThe real question that might be debated in the next few years is if these GameFi NFTs and tokens are securities.\nImportant events\nStronghold Digital Mining second quarter earnings\n10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China National Bureau of Labor Statistics press conference\n10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China retail sales (July)\nCoinDesk TV\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\nNetherlands Arrests Suspected Tornado Cash Developer; Miner Chandler Guo on Forking Ethereum\nIn a blow to privacy advocates fighting to protect decentralized finance, the Netherlands has arrested a suspected developer of Tornado Cash, the automated crypto mixing service sanctioned by the U.S. government.

Diamond Standard is aiming to change that by making Ethereum-based tokens that are backed by physical diamonds, which are standardized and tradeable on several exchanges.\nRead more: Blockchain Startup Aims to Open the $1T Diamond Market to More Investors\nThe blockchain company also views the new asset class as an alternative investment for anyone looking for a store of value amid a high inflation market environment, due to its lack of correlation to the returns of gold, stocks or bonds. “Investors need a new uncorrelated asset class, and this capital will enable us to increase capacity and expand our offerings,” said Cormac Kinney, founder and CEO of Diamond Standard.\nDiamond Standard, which is licensed in Bermuda to issue, sell and redeem tokens and digital assets, provides both retail and institutional investors with a diamond-backed digital currency. The physical coins, which are stored in a vault, hold eight to nine standardized diamonds. The diamond-embedded tokens are digitized through an Ethereum-based digital coin, bitcarbon, which is tradable on different exchanges.\nDiamond Standard Admin Trust, a Delaware statutory trust entity within the Diamond Standard Group, has also established a peer-to-peer marketplace to trade its token directly.",

    "summary": "Web3 developers and teachers weigh in with practical advice to help anyone get started building on blockchain.",
    "content": "A new form of the internet called Web3 is being built right in front of our eyes. It’s being built on permissionless blockchains where anyone can deploy a smart contract they’ve written. Indeed, some of the greatest developers in this nascent industry are anonymous people – no college degree or corporate work experience is required here.\nPerhaps you’re already a Web3 user, participate in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), vibe in non-fungible token (NFT) communities and trade crypto. You’ve seen what it’s like and now want to take a step further to help build better stuff – you want to be a builder, or a dev (short for developer).\nThis article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's third annual Best Universities for Blockchain Ranking.\nThe other great thing about Web3 is that it welcomes autodidacts – those who eschew formal courses or training and learn on their own by doing. If you’re interested in becoming a blockchain dev, everything you need to get started is available online.\nTo help you get started, we’ve asked developers, teachers and learners for their best tips.\nSee Also: Autodidacts, Welcome!\nUnderstand what blockchain is and does\nStart with the fundamentals and understand what blockchain is, and what it can do – also importantly, what it can’t do.\n“I think it's important for everyone to realize that at the heart of a cryptocurrency there is a single database – account balances, smart contract code, etc. – and a ‘blockchain’ is just a cryptographic audit trail that allows anyone to compute a copy of the database,” Patrick McCorry, researcher at blockchain tool developer Infura, told CoinDesk.\nMcCorry started a cryptocurrency course “because there are bystanders who are willing to make the jump into our space, but they are lacking the mental models and wider context on how the technology works.” The course is sponsored by his employer Infura and is available for free.\nCoinDesk also has articles to help get you started:\nOther top-notch resources include UC Berkley’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) school with plenty of free online material, including this YouTube video that lays out the basics.\nFamiliarize yourself with blockchain peculiarities\nNow that you understand what blockchain is, your next move should be figuring out the unique but crucial stuff related to this technology – stuff that you may not be familiar with from Web2, the internet dominated by companies like Meta and Google.\n“Understanding concepts like wallets, blockchain explorer, blockchain oracles and more that don't exist in a Web2 architecture are a crucial part to get involved in the blockchain,” Francesco Ciulla, a developer who helps others learn Web3, told CoinDesk.\nThe best way to learn about them may be just trying them out yourself. Here’s CoinDesk’s guide on how to choose and set up your first crypto wallet to get you started.\nGet started with coding\nIt’s possible to be a builder in crypto with no prior coding experience. But most devs suggest that you grasp the fundamentals of Javascript before jumping onto crypto’s most popular language, Solidity.\nAustin Griffith, who works for the Ethereum Foundation helping new devs, says the best way to learn is to start with Javascript and Website Development. There are myriad free resources available online for both.\nNext, you can move into Ethereum development using Griffith’s SpeedRunEthereum. But for those who don’t want to speed-run things, he also has a slow curriculum “that takes you through becoming a power user and learning to script before learning to build apps,” he said.\n“I think after someone crushes the speed run it's all about exploring the ecosystem and getting in the routine of shipping small prototypes publicly,” Griffith added.\nCiulla, who has recently switched from Web2 to Web3, wrote a step-by-step guide on how he made the transition and highly recommends at least one JavaScript course to get some basics before getting started with an introductory course about Solidity.\nChainShot, recently acquired by blockchain tool developer Alchemy, offers an online bootcamp to help you fast-track your Ethereum developer journey. There are also self-paced courses to learn all the basics of Ethereum and build simple DeFi protocols, and they are all free.\nIf you really don’t want to learn how to code but still want to build, there are options we’ll cover later.\nBuild in public\nBlockchains are systems of public and decentralized ledgers (Ethereum and Bitcoin are two prime examples), and emphasis on open source, collaboration and transparency defines the blockchain culture. There are private and other types of blockchains but the majority are public, and it’s where you should focus when you start building.\nBuilding in public by launching projects for everyone to see and contributing to other open-source projects is not only aligned with the ethos, it’s also a good step to accelerate learning.\n“The space is big and it moves fast. Things are really decentralized too. Iterating in public is a good combo move for a builder to explore new things, see what they are good at, and see what things actually resonate with users,” Griffith said.\nFor his part, Ciulla has kept a GitHub Repository of everything he’s learned from day one.\nLearn from those building in public\nKonrad Kopp, developer of wallet security protocol Signet, taught himself how to code through online resources and an in-person ChainShot bootcamp. He told CoinDesk that what excites him most about building in Web3 is the inherent transparency of blockchains and the open-source nature of work – and that can be immensely useful.\n“It’s super easy to actually look at other people's code base and play around with them yourself to see how exactly they work,” Kopp said. “And this code is not just projects by random people or tutorials but actual code used in production by the biggest Web3 companies and protocols.”\nHow does decentralized exchange Uniswap work, technically? Exactly like this. What’s the code logic of lending protocol Aave? You can see it right here.\nWhen you’re stuck while learning, you can look at examples that exist and already process billions of dollars in DeFi. “I think by far the best way that I’ve found for learning to code is to pick something you want to build out and just go for it. Break it down into components and build them as much as you can by yourself and where you can’t, try to find code that does something similar and that you can take apart and play around with,” Kopp said.\nAnd when you have a particular coding question, just go to online developer forum Stack Overflow like all developers. Though it’s a smart move to first Google your question since it’s likely been asked – and answered – before.\nJoin a community of developers\nLearning passively from others by reviewing their code isn’t your only option. You can also try joining a community of like-minded individuals striving toward the same goal of becoming better devs.\nPopular developer DAOs include LearnWeb3, Developer DAO, Odyssey DAO and Women Build Web3.\nIf you don’t want to code but still want to build …\nDon’t fret.\nMaybe you’re an artist who doesn’t want to get into coding just to launch an NFT collection and build a community around it. You still have options in Web3.\nBueno is a no-code NFT launch platform developed by artist Pablo Stanley.\nAnd if you don’t want to learn how to interact with blockchain explorers like EtherScan, then you can use Formie that turns any smart contract into human-readable forms.",

Musk is due to face a deposition in October, but a series of texts sent and received by the billionaire released on Friday shed some light on what was going on leading up to the offer and what may have led to him scrapping the deal.\nThe text messages spanned 40 pages and the six months between January and June. The messages involve a number of public figures and entrepreneurs – from angel investor Jason Calacanis and American television personality Gayle King to controversial podcast host Joe Rogan – hyping the acquisition offer and gushing over the billionaire's plans for the social media platform.\nMusk offered to buy the social media platform because he believed it failed to protect free speech and therefore threatened democracy.

There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed,\" Musk said in a text message to his entrepreneur brother Kimbal Musk on April 9.\nRead more: Musk Sees Logic for Twitter as a Crypto Payments Platform\nTwitter on a blockchain\nIn March, before Musk's own blockchain musings, he received a text message from philosopher and author William MacAskill, who said tech entrepreneur and founder of crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried was also \"potentially interested in purchasing\" Twitter to make it \"better for the world.\" MacAskill then shares SBF's number should Musk be interested in discussing a \"joint effort in that direction.\"\nMusk replied: \"Does he have huge amounts of money?\"\nThe text messages that followed indicate SBF may have spoken with Musk in early April before Musk expressed interest in incorporating blockchain to a social media platform to his brother Kimbal Musk.\nOn April 9, Kimbal replied saying he has \"dug deep on Web3\" and its \"voting powers are amazing and verified.\" Voting rights could \"crowdsource\" kicking scammers out, Kimbal said, referring to another reason why Musk wanted to buy the social media platform – to rid it of bots and scammers.\n\"Blockchain prevents people from deleting tweets. Pros and cons, but the let the games begin!\" Kimbal said to Musk who had also called for Twitter to allow messages to be edited after being posted.\nKimbal also suggests exploring a native digital token for Twitter that users will have to hold in a wallet to be able to post messages. The token \"doesn't have to be expensive,\" Kimbal said, adding \"it will grow over time in value.\"\nRead more: SEC Calls 9 Cryptos 'Securities' in Insider Trading Case\nThe deal dies\nOn April 9, on the same day that Elon Musk was mulling a blockchain social media network, he texted Bret Taylor, chairman of Twitter's board of directors, telling him to expect an offer to take the company private. He messaged Taylor after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal asked Musk to stop tweeting.\nAlthough Twitter founder Jack Dorsey appeared to be supportive of Musk's takeover offer, things quickly soured between Musk and Agrawal. Through April, Dorsey attempts to smooth things over, even saying he wants to make sure Agrawal does \"everything possible to build towards\" Musk's goals until the deal is closed. But by the end of the month, things appeared to have worsened.\n\"At least it became clear that you can't work together. That was clarifying,\" Dorsey said to Musk on April 26, referring to Agrawal, to which Musk replied, \"Yeah.\"\nRead more: Does Crypto Still Care About Elon Musk?",

Gavin Newsom vetoed a crypto licensing and regulation bill this week – seen as a possible West Coast version of New York's BitLicense – he approved another on Wednesday that instructs county records offices to allow for the use of blockchain technology and verifiable credentials. The technology would be established in the distribution of birth, death and marriage records, allowing PDFs to be sent immediately rather than using a typical 10-day postal delivery.\nThe bill, introduced by California state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, represents a test of blockchain in an essential governmental function in the most populous U.S. state.\n“This secure and highly convenient process will allow the average person to access their vital records and shows California is still leading the way for innovation,” Hertzberg said in a statement to CoinDesk on Thursday.\nWhen arguing the merits of the bill to the Senate last month, Hertzberg said this is “not only a faster, cheaper, and more efficient delivery method, saving Californians both time and money, but it is also much more secure as blockchain is nearly impossible to hack.”\nAlso, this week in the U.S. Senate a bill to set up a governmental task force on digital identity cleared the Senate Homeland Security committee. The legislation – also reflected by a similar effort in the House – is meant to advance work at the federal and state levels toward setting up interoperable, government-approved digital identities. The Bank Policy Institute said the effort “would improve security and enhance customer convenience.”",

    "summary": "Cosmos is likely to announce the interchain security feature next week, opening doors for the token to capture value from the entire network.",
    "content": "Investors starved for bullish catalysts seem to be parking their money in ATOM, the native coin of Cosmos Hub, the blockchain acting as an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network.\nObservers say they are doing so in expectation that a Sept. 26 conference will see the announcement of additional uses for the token and better security for the network.\nATOM has risen 10% to $15.30 since Thursday, bucking the broader market weakness caused by the \"sell-the-fact\" response to the successful implementation of Ethereum's technological upgrade, the Merge, according to CoinDesk data. The token's ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC)-denominated prices have increased by 32% and 14%, respectively.\n\"The market is looking for assets with a catalyst right now and ATOM happens to have one, which is why it is outperforming,\" said Katie Talati, director of research at Arca. \"Cosmos is holding its annual conference next week, where it is expected to release a tokenomics white paper detailing more use cases for ATOM.\"\n\"Some potential announcements could relate to the release of interchain security, a feature that allows projects to rely on the Cosmos base chain for their security, which might increase the usage and staking of ATOM,\" Talati said.\nCosmos is expected to announce the most anticipated feature, interchain security, at the annual Cosmoverse conference in Medellin, Colombia.\nATOM-powered, network-wide security\nThe interchain security feature will make Comos Hub responsible for network-wide security and enable ATOM to be used to secure all blockchains in the network.\nUnder that plan, the proof-of-stake Cosmos Hub blockchain would lease its ATOM-token backed validators to budding chains. That would allow every blockchain, or zone, in the Cosmos network to share security using ATOM instead of their respective native tokens. Currently, chains are forced to either pay high inflationary token rewards to validators or face the risk of hacker attacks on their chains.\nThe move would allow ATOM to derive value from the entire ecosystem and add a new use for the token. As of now, it can be used for staking, holding and spending. ATOM stakers get the right to vote on network upgrades and receive rewards proportional to the number of coins staked.\nAccording to Emperor Osmo, a writer from Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, interchain security could lead to reduced supply of ATOM because stakers will receive multiple staking rewards from every chain using the share security feature. That, in turn, could boost staking, sucking out coins from the market.\n\"As more chains enable interchain security [by using ATOM], more rewards are given to stakers,\" Osmo tweeted. \"The more ATOM is staked, the less ATOM there is in the market.\"\nSticks in a bundle can't be broken\nAn old saying says, \"Sticks in a bundle can't be broken, but sticks taken singly can be easily broken.\"\nThe interchain security feature will essentially bundle all Cosmos blockchains from a security point of view, making it harder for malicious entities to launch an attack.\n\"The Cosmos Hub has 175 validators who collectively have 193 million ATOM tokens staked, worth just north of $2 billion,\" VanEck's research team, headed by Matthew Sigel, wrote in a market insights post last month. \"An attacker who wants to attack the Cosmos Hub economically will need to spend much more than this figure to hack the Cosmos Hub and its hosted blockchains.\"\nVanEck is bullish on ATOM. \"Based on our discounted cash flow analysis of potential Cosmos ecosystem value in 2030, we arrived at a $140 price target for the ATOM token with downside to $1,\" VanECK's research team noted.\nCosmoverse to address inflation concerns\nStill, ATOM is an inflationary cryptocurrency with an appreciating supply, which may hinder potential price appreciation.\nAccording to data source Messari, ATOM's current annual inflation is 5.74%. According to VanEck, inflation under the current economic model is targeted roughly at 13%, which may be \"too high to sustain strong token price appreciation over the long term.\"\nThe conference is likely to address the issue.\n\"It is widely expected that the team will soon announce new tokenomics for ATOM that will reduce inflation,\" Kaiko's weekly newsletter published Monday said.\nThe newsletter added that Cosmos and ATOM have benefited from several protocols leaving Terra after its implosion and relaunching on Cosmos.",

BTC was recently trading over $19,400, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier after recovering from an early morning plunge.\n\"Bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks remains, but it isn’t breaking as bad as it has during most of this cycle,\" wrote Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya in an email, noting the tech heavy Nasdaq's steep decline Thursday and bitcoin's recent ability to tread near or above $19,000 support. \"It appears Wall Street believes crypto is close to the bottom and will become an attractive diversification strategy once the peak in Treasury yields is in place,\" Moya added.\nEther was recently trading just above $1,330, down a little more than a percentage point from the same time a day ago. Other major cryptos traded sideways, with a slight red tint. ATOM and UNI were down about 4% and 3%, respectively. But XRP and XLM were recently up approximately 7% and 6%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, was up slightly to over 963.\nEquities had a day to forget, with the Nasdaq off nearly 3% and the S&P 500 down more than 2% as investors cringed from the latest bond market tumult and a U.S. Commerce Department report confirming that the U.S. was in recession by the traditional definition of two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). The yield for 10-year Treasurys increased to over 3.74%, not far off its highest settlement date this year, while two-year yields continue to hover well over 4%.\nMarkets also continued to wrestle with the newly installed British leadership's economic policy of tax cuts and expanded spending to pull the country from its current doldrums. Observers of the U.K. are concerned that the moves will exacerbate its high inflation.\nLate Wednesday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam said that CFTC-led regulation could have significant benefits for the crypto industry, including a potential boost to the price of bitcoin. “Bitcoin might double in price if there’s a CFTC-regulated market,” Behnam told attendees during a fireside chat at NYU School of Law.\nBehnam's remarks underscored an increasingly widespread belief in the importance of crypto regulation.\nIn an appearance Thursday morning on CoinDesk TV's \"First Mover\" program, Greg Johnson, the co-founder and CEO of investment adviser Rubicon Crypto, said that crypto would likely continue trading at its current levels until regulatory agencies can set clear guidelines. \"We're in a purgatory that probably isn't going to go away for some time,\" Johnson said. \"Nothing meaningful is going to change in the crypto markets until we get ... regulatory clarity. That is going to allow for the next wave of meaningful adoption.\"\nJohnson added that clear regulation would encourage traditional financial services firms to expand in the crypto space. \"We're ready to move when we start to see traditional broker dealers and institutions not just say we have clarity, but start to hire to include enterprise-wide training of digital assets, we start to see the series 24 exam include topics and questions on digital assets.\"\nBiggest Gainers\nBiggest Losers\nInsights\nWill Shimmer Be the Next Big Blockchain? OATA Hopes So\nBy Shaurya Malwa\nSINGAPORE — Crypto project IOTA unveiled its Shimmer platform Wednesday during an official launch event during the Token 2049 conference here.\nThe launch comes amid a flurry of blockchain upstarts, each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one, and often attracting hordes of venture funding. This year alone has seen the formation of networks including Sui and Aptos, alongside Ethereum-based scaling networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism.\nIOTA, which enjoys its own cult following, much like other networks, said Shimmer’s unveiling followed nearly two years of testing a product that will eventually be used to test core protocol improvements and feature upgrades to IOTA-based applications in a “live” environment.\nThat means Shimmer is no testnet, or a blockchain used solely for testing purposes, and would instead exist as a full-scale, separate blockchain with its own SMR tokens.\nShimmer brings with it a unique model that allows budding developers to release various tokens, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), tokenized real-world assets and stablecoins natively on a layer 1, or base, network without fees.\nThis is unlike other networks wherein participants usually pay fees – ranging from a few pennies to as much as a few hundred dollars – to deploy their tokens or projects.\nIOTA says that such a design serves as the foundational basis for Shimmer’s smart contract execution layer, which includes full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. EVM broadly refers to an extensive database that holds all Ethereum's accounts and balances, atop which developers can create services and deploy decentralized applications (dapps).\nSupport for a multi-chain ecosystem\nEventually, the ShimmerEVM will allow developers from other EVM-compliant networks to access the Shimmer network using other networks, thus creating support for a multi-chain ecosystem.\nAnother key feature of the Shimmer network is support for bridgeless native asset transfers across the entire Shimmer ecosystem. Bridges refer to blockchain-based tools that allow users to transfer tokens between different networks. Such tools have been highly susceptible to exploits in the past year, including a $600 million attack on Ronin, a $200 million attack on Nomad and other similar exploits.\nThe SMR tokens were distributed to anyone staking IOTA tokens over a three-month period, with some 1.4 billion SMR generated from users staking IOTA. Some 181 million SMR were voted on by the community to the Shimmer Community Treasury (DAO), a community-governed entity that would independently fund community projects.\nThe launch of the ShimmerEVM chain is expected in the coming weeks on the basis of successful and adequate security tests.\nImportant events\nCircle Converge22 (San Francisco)\nCRYPTO FEST 2022 (South Africa)\nSmartcon Web3 Chainlink Conference (New York)\nCoinDesk TV\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\nJack Mallers on Strike’s $80M Raise; Bitcoin Holds Strong Over $19K\nJack Mallers, CEO and founder of crypto payment firm Strike, joined \"First Mover\" to discuss plans to \"revolutionize payments for merchants and consumers globally.\" CoinDesk's Emily Parker dug into central bank digital currencies.

    "content": "ISTANBUL – Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor has questioned the soundness of Ethereum, both in terms of its technical development and its ethics.\nSaylor, the founder and CEO of business-intelligence software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR), spoke remotely for close to an hour at Blockchain Economy Istanbul Wednesday, elaborating on the question of what he thought of Ethereum.\nSaylor, whose MicroStrategy holds a stash of 129,218 bitcoin (BTC) worth about $2.8 billion at current prices, noted that he was speaking as an institutional investor and in that regard, one would \"have to wait until the protocol is complete.\" He pointed out that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in a speech last week that Ethereum was 40% done and had laid out a roadmap of three to four years, which means the \"protocol doesn’t look like it's going to be completed or stable for another 36 months.\"\nSaylor also questioned the lack of time-tested information about Ethereum, saying it led to concerns about the protocol's technical reliability and security.\n\"'Technically sound' means I need to see the protocol function for that thing after about five to 10 years. So we don’t know that, either. Right? Because if you are hard forking and changing it, every time you do a big upgrade, you introduce new attack surfaces\" he said.\nIn addition, Saylor cast doubt on the ethical soundness of Ethereum.\n\"'Ethically sound' means I need to know that nobody could change [the protocol], which includes Vitalik. I need to know that no one at the Ethereum foundation, no individual can change the protocol because if they could change the protocol, it makes it a security and if it makes it a security, then it’s not going to become global money,\" Saylor said.\nSaylor has recently suggested that MicroStrategy will never sell its bitcoin.\nRead More: Jefferies Downgrades MicroStrategy to 'Underperform;' Shares Slump",

    "summary": "Diamond Standard believes tokenizing diamonds will make investing in the precious stones easier and more efficient.",
    "content": "A pioneering software entrepreneur believes his nearly five-year-old blockchain company has found a way to open the $1.2 trillion diamond market to a wider group of investors.\nCormac Kinney sees Diamond Standard as a way to remove the major obstacles from owning and investing in the precious stones. Diamond Standard’s patented technology is designed to create a more transparent system allowing investors to track supply chains and subsequent ownership of the world’s ultimate bling more easily and efficiently.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nKinney noted in an interview with CoinDesk that the diamond market is “bigger than almost all other precious metals combined, except gold.” That diamonds are uncorrelated to gold, stocks or bonds also provides investors with a hedge.\n“Blockchain was the last technology that we needed to turn diamonds into a commodity and unlock this new asset as a hedge, as a store of wealth, as a speculative investment and, ultimately, as a digital currency asset,” Kinney said.\nDespite diamonds’ allure throughout history, the industry has struggled to attract investors largely because gem markets, which are spaced in different parts of the world, lack a uniform system for standardizing value.\nThe long, antiquated process of mining and transporting diamonds also presents an obstacle for investors looking for clarity and order. “With a diamond, the only way to move ownership in a consistently provable way across several different entities (the miner, the broker and the store) is to physically move the diamond between those entities,” said Patrick White, co-founder and CEO of digital asset finance platform Bitwave.\nTransforming an industry\nKinney saw an opportunity to transform the diamond industry through blockchain technology with its built-in ability to record information securely and accurately. The former quantitative finance manager at several financial services firms and founder of six technology startups has focused much of his 27-year career developing platforms that improve the way organizations collect and analyze data, including heat maps and other technologies providing real-time information.\nDiamond Standard, which is licensed in Bermuda to issue, sell and redeem tokens and digital assets, provides retail and institutional investors with a diamond-backed digital currency that has standardized value and liquidity. Physical coins, which the company stores in a vault, hold eight to nine standardized diamonds. The diamond-embedded tokens are digitized through an Ethereum-based digital coin, bitcarbon, which is tradable on different exchanges. Diamond Standard Admin Trust, a Delaware statutory trust entity within the Diamond Standard Group, has also established a peer-to-peer marketplace to trade its token directly.\nMore recently, Diamond Standard introduced a fund that already has more than $100 million in investments, Kinney said. The fund allows investors to invest in both digital assets and commodities without having to navigate regulations, he said. “We have a lot of clients who liked the [Diamond Standard] investment thesis and wanted to allocate [funds] to diamonds, but they couldn't buy the coins or bars, and they couldn't buy the token,” Kinney said. “So they buy the fund.”\nTokenized commodities\nTokenization of commodities has been popular among investors and traders during periods of high inflation by providing access to assets that are hedges against rising prices and volatile markets. A physical gold-backed token, PAX gold (PAXG), which has a market cap of nearly $600 million according to CoinMarketCap, is one example. But even agricultural commodities such as soy and corn are being tokenized to provide access to investors and farmers.\nRead more: Santander Launches Loans Backed by Tokenized Commodities Such as Soy and Corn\nDigitization of commodities also creates transparency and efficiency for investors, unlocking liquidity for the asset class. “By enforcing a more efficient financial system, tokenization effectively reduces market risk and enforces a greater level of security for data analysis and reporting,” said RA Wilson, chief technology officer of digital asset exchange for carbon credits 1GCX.\n“It also creates new ways for derivatives to be traded, increases liquidity in order to tighten spreads (the difference between two prices), and creates real-time reporting mechanisms that will allow for greater transparency within the commodities markets,” he added.\nBitwave’s White said that digitized assets also address potential legal issues.\n“Suddenly, changing the ownership of a diamond, in a way that has enormous amounts of documented evidence and will stand up in a legal setting, can happen entirely through simple on-chain transactions,” he said.“This fundamentally changes the nature of supply chains, where ownership can move disjunct from physical location, and vice versa.”\nCould Diamond Standard’s set a new trend?\n1GCX’s Wilson noted optimistically that tokenization’s vastly improved “transparency and market governance within the entire commodities industry” make it “the logical next step toward advancing and scaling our most important global markets.”\n“It allows these markets to trade 24/7 rather than being limited to traditional trading hours, which will create even greater opportunity for growth within the space,\" he said.\nRead more: Putting it on the Diamond Chain: Tiffany and Co Reveals $50K CryptoPunk Pendant\nUPDATE (September 9, 17:50 UTC): Added more details about company's peer-to-peer marketplace.",

    "summary": "The crypto trading firm and builder is reupping its commitment after the once-hot blockchain hit potholes.",
    "content": "Jump Crypto is trying to revamp a core part of Solana’s infrastructure, seeking to boost the throughput and reliability of a network that’s been plagued by frequent outages and slowdowns.\nThe cryptocurrency arm of Chicago-based TradFi giant Jump Trading Group is building a new validator client, which is software that helps secure a blockchain. Additionally, Jump Crypto will “propose significant upgrades to Solana’s open-source core software,” according to a statement released Tuesday.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nFor Wall Street and other conventional finance firms like Jump, Solana turned into a key focus last year given that – unlike Ethereum and other blockchains used in decentralized finance (DeFi) – it was viewed as being able to keep pace of the incredibly fast pace of trading in older markets like stocks and derivatives. But the hype wasn’t always realized, with Solana breaking down in several high-profile incidents. Meanwhile, newer blockchains threaten Solana’s market share.\n“Jump has unparalleled experience with over 20 years of scaling networks and building highly performant software systems,” Dan Albert, executive director of the Solana Foundation, said in the statement. “Their contributions to the Solana Network will improve mission-critical systems, helping the network scale to billions of users.”\nKevin Bowers, chief science officer at Jump Trading, will oversee the project. Through an initiative called Firedancer, Jump Crypto will build the validator client using the C++ programming language, which has a long history in the quantitative trading circles where Jump roams.\nJump Crypto’s statement Tuesday says the initiative is an “important step in the network’s continued decentralization.”\nJump Crypto has firsthand experience with the dangers of a project’s well-being resting too much on a single company’s shoulders. It’s a driving force behind Wormhole, a cross-blockchain bridge that got hacked earlier this year. Jump Crypto coughed up money to cover losses from the $320 million exploit.\nJump Crypto also expanded Wormhole onto the Terra blockchain last October. Months later, Terra’s UST stablecoin depegged in dramatic fashion, a blow that sent Terra’s LUNA token plummeting and users fleeing the network.\nIn the past year, the company has expanded beyond its pure trading roots, venturing into building key pieces of infrastructure for Solana and other popular layer 1 blockchains. The company, which emerged from the Chicago trading pits, has been at the forefront of electronic trading for more than two decades. It’s among the firms that built up the infrastructure of markets like stocks and derivatives so that they operate – literally – at the speed of light.\nRead More: Jump Crypto Wants You to Know Its Name\nJump Crypto’s involvement in this Solana overhaul comes at an uncertain time for the once-hot blockchain. It suffered a major outage in June that rendered it unusable for over four hours, as well as a $5 million hack affecting thousands of user wallets earlier in August.\nSolana’s SOL token is down 75% this year, trading relatively flat in recent months even as ether, the token for competing blockchain Ethereum, has more than doubled from its lows.\nBut it appears Jump is doubling down on Solana, even though it’s also a major backer of hot new “Solana-killer” blockchain Aptos.\n“I’m excited for Jump’s engineers to bring a new perspective to the network and help improve network resiliency and efficiency,” Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said in the statement.",

    "summary": "As traditional financial firms expand into crypto, recruiters will seek traditional hiring credentials, creating a sea change at universities and the crypto job market overall. This story is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.",
    "content": "Soon after Tal Rabin joined the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2020 the computer and information sciences professor successfully convinced the institution to let her teach a dedicated blockchain engineering class.\n“I had a class of 140, but I was restricted by the size of the room,” she said. “There were 200 students on the waiting list who didn't get in, so it was definitely received with a lot of excitement.”\nThis post is part of Education Week.\nDespite the strong demand from students, Rabin, who specializes in cryptography, soon found the challenges that came with teaching such a broad subject with so few educational standards and course materials. With such a broad range of potentially relevant subjects to cover, Rabin says she often has to lean on the expertise of others.\n“I invite all kinds of speakers to talk about things that I think are important for the blockchain but that I don't know about, such as law issues associated with blockchain, the [Securities and Exchange Commission], mining data, [non-fungible tokens] and art and things like that,” she said.\nWhile interest in blockchain education is high, the courses that are available can vary significantly between institutions, and are often dependent on a small number of enthusiastic professors. “If I look around at courses that my friends are teaching, people are all teaching it from their vantage point,” said Rabin.\nWith minimal educational infrastructure – such as standards and certifications, even course materials and textbooks – to lean on, formal education in the blockchain space remains largely driven by individual professors. While they are occasionally supported by partnerships with blockchain native companies and foundations – such as Algorand Foundation, where Rabin serves as head of research – institutions of higher learning won’t be able to pump crypto graduates into the industry in significant numbers anytime soon. (In any case, only eight of 240 schools screened by CoinDesk for the Best Universities for Blockchain 2022 had an undergraduate major in blockchain.)\n“It might still be a long way out, because what would such a credential include?” she said. “Would it include the foundations of the blockchain? Would it include understanding applications on top? Things are changing daily in this field, and it takes time for these things to mature.”\nEnter Tradfi\nBlockchain has long had a skills problem because adoption, investment and use cases have continually outpaced the availability of talent. Up until now the industry has been able to achieve significant growth relying on those who are self-taught and those they can train themselves, but that won’t be enough to bring the industry into the mainstream.\nThough it’s still relatively early days some of the biggest names in finance – including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs – are already betting big on blockchain. In fact, JPMorgan’s crypto team is already staffed by 200 full-time employees.\nBlockchain has the potential to touch nearly every corner of the traditional financial industry, ranging from investment banks to private equity firms, hedge funds, law firms, payments providers and more. As a result, there will be a massive need for qualified talent with an equally broad range of blockchain-based skills throughout the sector in the years ahead.\nAs more traditional institutions look to grow their blockchain capabilities – and with it, their talent rosters – many are looking for some sort of educational standard. That is especially true in finance, a heavily regulated industry that has long had to maintain strict licensing and educational requirements for compliance reasons, and is accustomed to considering candidates in large part based on their formal education.\nWhile some may fear the finance industry having an outsized influence on blockchain education, Rabin said its strongest promoters remain the blockchain-native startups, at least for now.\n“At this point in time the people who are giving funds to universities to create educational programs are the blockchain companies, not the traditional financial industry, so at this point their voice is being heard more,” she said.\nUp until quite recently, however, there was no such thing as formal education in blockchain, and what exists today is hardly sufficient to support a finance industry that is taking blockchain’s potential seriously, as many finally are.\nThe relatively young crypto industry, in near total contrast, has long prized those self-taught enthusiasts over those who descend from an ivory tower, in keeping with the decentralized, grassroots nature of the movement. That mentality, however, may soon be at risk of becoming a victim of its own success.\nThe self-taught pioneers of the field were so effective in convincing the rest of the world to take the space seriously that many traditional financial institutions are rapidly enhancing their blockchain capabilities and are hungry for talent; too hungry to rely on the self-taught talent pool alone. Now the market is calling for a more effective and universal education infrastructure that can help carry the industry into the future.\n“There’s been a big step change in demand,” says Caroline Lo, a partner and co-leader of the financial services practice at True, a global executive talent search firm. “It started when a number of well-known hedge funds and business leaders stated that a significant portion of their wealth or [assets under managers] were in crypto; statements like that raised the bar of confidence that crypto is here to stay.”\nToday, more than a third of traditional hedge funds invest in digital assets, according to a recent PwC report, and more than two-thirds intend to increase their holdings by the end of the year.\nLo, who spent 15 working for traditional financial institutions, says the heavily regulated industry is accustomed to hiring staff with a seal of approval from a trusted educational institution, or those who have at least passed a standard evaluation.\n“For example, to become a salesperson selling derivatives you have to have achieved a certain level of knowledge in derivative understanding and risk profiles and know how the product is traded in order to sell it,” she said. “Anyone in the derivative market takes a similar test, whether they’re in London or Hong Kong or New York.”\nLo explains that while many in the industry are still curious about the technology and keen to expand their blockchain capabilities, they often can’t move as quickly as they would like because of the challenges associated with qualifying talent.\n“What companies go through now when they're hiring at a junior or mid level is they have to go through more rounds of interviewing than they would for a non-crypto hire in order to build confidence and consensus that this person has the required skills,” she said.\nLo added that the task is made harder by the number of enthusiasts who are self-taught but not to a sufficient degree. She explained that many can talk the talk in an interview but it’s much harder to identify those who actually have the required skills.\n“If there was some kind of understanding and certification that people could achieve, it would be very helpful to the industry,” she said. “It would set a bar for quality and confidence in the industry, which could help blockchain and crypto become more mainstream within financial services.”\nFor the meantime Lo said most are relying on their ability to up-skill existing staff or hire candidates with relevant education in adjacent fields. There also seems to be a preference for candidates who participate in on-campus blockchain clubs, and those with some prior work experience at blockchain-related startups. She is also seeing a lot of traditional financial institutions putting together teams that combine blockchain skills with experts from other disciplines when they struggle to find enough candidates with expertise in both areas.\n“For example, where we see a lot of that activity is in building up teams in payments companies,” said Lo. “What a number of firms have had to do is put together a team where some people know payments and some people know crypto, but it’s been very hard to find anyone who knows crypto payments.”\nWhat happens to the self-taught?\nWhile the industry is calling for more regulation, educational standards and eventually a broadly accepted credential, Lo also said it's important to exercise caution, especially in such a new and fragile field. She, like many, fears what might happen if educational requirements become too stringent, or lead companies to dismiss those without a certain credential.\n“You can go too far with something like that, especially in a market that is still very early but is hugely creative,” said Lo. “You need to make sure it's set the right way so that innovation is not stifled, but it allows for fantastically innovative and creative people to have an accreditation that recognizes them as being qualified to build, create and advise on crypto.”\nA field that combines technology and finance striking a balance between the self-taught and the credentialed will be delicate but vital to enabling ongoing innovation. The tech industry itself has long welcomed the talented dropout on an equal playing field with the top-tier university graduate, but finance generally has a preference for one profile over the other.\nIf and when a broadly accepted credential is established, however, it could serve to limit the career opportunities of those without one.\nRead more: Autodidacts Welcome!\nGina Pieters, an assistant instructional professor at the University of Chicago’s Department of Economics – which offers blockchain-specific undergraduate and graduate-level courses – isn’t concerned that more formal education will push out those who are self-taught, however. That is because she said the two are rarely competing for the same career opportunities; the self-taught tend to prefer working for (or starting) blockchain native companies, as opposed to working for more traditional institutions.\n“It fulfills a slightly different niche,” she said. “People will continue self-studying, and we encourage that. I don't think we are replacing that, and I don't think it's a competing product.”\nPieters explained that students who are eyeing careers in blockchain-native companies and startups tend to take those courses out of personal interest. Those who are keen on applying for roles with traditional financial institutions, however, seem confident that even a limited educational background in the field will serve as an asset.\n“If students want to go to J.P. Morgan or a traditional firm, they’ll think, ‘this might give me an edge,’” she said. “For them it’s adding an additional ability to talk about when they're interviewing.”\nThose who are seeking jobs in major financial institutions after graduation believe that even listing a blockchain-related course on their résumé is an asset, given the demand for such skills and the limited credentialing that exists. “With the traditional firm going into the crypto space you see a far more traditional mindset in that regard,” she said.\nAt the same time Pieters doesn’t think those same candidates are taking job opportunities away from the self-educated. “The self-study students would prefer a job with a crypto [or blockchain-native] firm,” she said.\nAs of now the two worlds work well together, with both the formally educated and self-taught finding their own place within the industry. What she and others fear, however, is that the push to establish more formal educational standards and credentials could limit opportunities for those who are self-educated.\n“If firms accept sub-standard workers simply because they have formal education, that's a failure,” she said. “At the same time there are people for whom the formal education system works well, and to say we should only accept self-study learners is also unfair.”\nLayer 2\nEducation Week",

    "content": "Decentralized exchange DeversiFi is launching a new feature for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders: cross-chain swaps, allowing users to transact across multiple chains.\nIn current multi-chain ecosystems, users have to set up multiple wallets or bridges, paying gas fees on transactions between tokens. DeversiFi founder Will Harborne said he aims to solve this by integrating multiple chains to facilitate more efficient transactions.\n“We remove the cognitive load and complexity – they can just buy tokens on other chains without ever needing to consider the bridges,” said Harborne.\nAccording to Harborne, DeversiFi currently has 63,000 users. It will build out its cross-chain feature by first integrating Polygon and, in the coming months, incorporate Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum.\nIn order to facilitate this upgrade, DeversiFi is partnering with decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator ParaSwap to aid users in converting their USDT or USDC tokens into Polygon tokens to keep transactions within DeversiFi.\nDeversiFi’s cross-chain upgrade follows a trend of protocols looking to multichain. In March, DeFi protocol Aave launched its version 3 upgrade to prioritize cross-chain swaps, and in April, DeFi platform Hashflow introduced bridgeless, cross-chain swaps.\nHowever, cross-chain capabilities don’t come without risk.\nThe $625 million Ronin Hack (the blockchain behind Axie Infinity) exposed the safety risks associated with sacrificing decentralization in cross-chain transactions. Similarly, the Poly Network hack in August may have been triggered by signing a cross-chain message, accidentally leaking a private key.\n“We don’t reduce the risk,” said Harborne on DeversiFi’s launch. “We simply make it far easier for users to access other chains.”",

Dust limits are thresholds encoded in the Dogecoin network that denote the minimum amount of currency used for a transaction to be processed on the chain.\nWallet operators can also identify if any transactions are stuck, have not been mined or are not in the mempool, a holding bin for transactions waiting to get mined into blocks. This prevents the node from sending out old transactions that got lost.\nAnother wallet-related fix allows node operators to change the maximum number of connections their node allows without needing to restart, allowing for more fine-grained control of the node's network capacities.\nA new remote procedure call (RPC) method, rescan, has been added to allow node operators to rescan the chain for wallet transactions from a certain height, as per developer documents. “This can help speed up the rescan process for keys known to be generated after a certain date or block height,” developers explained in the release.\nDogecoin’s native DOGE tokens saw volatile trading in the past 24 hours. Prices fell some 9%, regressing almost all gains from Tuesday’s run as traders took profits on their positions.

    "title": "Tezos: What Makes It Different?",
    "summary": "The energy-efficient platform has participants \"baking\" instead of staking their XTZ and allows forkless upgrades.",
    "content": "Tezos is a smart contract platform used to issue new digital assets and create decentralized applications (dapps). The project gained notoriety as one of the first blockchain-based projects to implement a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm over a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used by Bitcoin.\nDespite newer projects like Solana and Cardano implementing PoS, and Ethereum transitioning from PoW to PoS, Tezos continues to develop other aspects of its platform.\nSo what makes Tezos different?\nOverview of Tezos\nTezos was founded in August 2014 by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, who published a position paper under the pseudonym L.M. Goodman. The Breitmans followed up the position paper with the official Tezos white paper, which highlighted the platform’s functionality using its native cryptocurrency, XTZ. According to the white paper, XTZ enables Tezos’s smart contract functionality and gives holders the opportunity to participate in on-chain governance.\nXTZ is an inflationary asset with a fixed issuance rate of around 5.51% and an uncapped token supply. By inflationary, more XTZ is generated over time due to its PoS consensus mechanism. PoS consensus mechanisms reward users (known as validators) for confirming transactions and fine validators for acting maliciously. Both fines and rewards are paid in XTZ, which makes the token supply increase over time.\nDue to the open-source nature of the platform, Tezos is decentralized from any single entity and developed by the community. To best support the community, the Tezos Foundation was created following the XTZ token launch in 2017. The Tezos Foundation is responsible for supervising the platform’s development and ensuring its long-term success. Through community development and support from the Tezos Foundation, Tezos has developed into a unique blockchain that functions similarly but works differently from other PoS blockchains.\nWhat makes Tezos different?\nWhat makes Tezos different from other blockchains can be briefly summarized by three main points:\nLet’s dive into each of these bullets in more detail.\nEnergy efficiency\nOne way the Tezos blockchain is different is its reduced energy consumption and low carbon footprint. Using a PoS consensus algorithm means it is already using less energy than the computer-driven PoW on blockchains such as Bitcoin.\nAccording to an independent report conducted by PwC, Tezos transactions consume approximately 2.5g of carbon dioxide (CO2) per transaction, while Ethereum currently consumes around 79.67kg of CO2 per transaction. Put differently, the Tezos network has approximately the same carbon footprint as 17 people, while Ethereum has a carbon footprint close to the entire country of Ireland. Tezos developers are continuing to bring the platform’s energy consumption down even lower and say the blockchain has already increased its transaction efficiency by over 70% since the platform launched, despite a growing ecosystem.\nMany DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEX), dapps and other projects are working on the Tezos blockchain. Non-fungible tokens (NFT), in particular, have become increasingly popular on the Tezos platform thanks to its low carbon footprint. Existing platforms including Rarible have integrated Tezos NFTs, while new projects like the music NFT platform OneOf have built on Tezos.\nBaking rewards\nTezos validates transactions through a process known as baking rather than staking. Staking is typically how PoS-based blockchains verify transactions on the network. Baking on Tezos reaches the same result by, among other ways, letting XTZ holders delegate their tokens to so-called bakers. Delegating XTZ to bakers enables on-chain governance and validation rewards without needing the minimum 8,000 tokens (known as 1 \"roll\") to do so.\nRelated: Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide\nThe delegation structure behind Tezo’s baking system is unique from traditional PoS consensus, but also from delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchains like EOS or Tron. Under traditional DPoS consensus, delegation is required for the blockchain to reach consensus. With Tezos, delegation is often the most convenient way to participate in the ecosystem, but it is not a requirement for consensus. This distinction has led the Tezos community to distinguish the platform’s consensus from DPoS by referring to it as liquid staking.\nForkless upgrades\nIn April, Tezos released its Tenderbake upgrade, which enabled faster transactions and decentralized applications. Three months later, Tezos announced the launch of Jakarta, the blockchain's 10th major protocol upgrade. The Tenderbake, Jakarta and other upgrades prior were able to be implemented without the need for a fork.\nForkless upgrades set Tezos apart from other blockchains because of its ability to self-upgrade and eliminate disruption for Tezos users. When major upgrades are required on other blockchains, like Ethereum, a hard fork is required for the features to be implemented. A hard fork essentially splits a blockchain into two different versions, making the older one invalid. Developers and node operators are required to transition over to the new fork or risk losing funds or being left behind. With Tezos, the transition to a new upgrade is seamless, allowing bakers and developers to continue working without disruption.\nFor an upgrade to happen on the Tezos blockchain, a proposal must first be presented to the community and voted on. If the proposal passes the on-chain governance, the upgrade will then be tested on a separate blockchain to ensure its success. Once the upgrade is considered to be stable on the testnet, the upgrade is then seamlessly switched over to the main Tezos blockchain.\nRead More: Investing in Crypto: Alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether",

Gupta conceived the idea after encountering a former elected politician in his area of jurisdiction who had fraudulently acquired tribal land by presenting himself as a tribal member with a fake caste certificate.\nWhile the politician had been convicted by the Supreme Court of India, it took Gupta's administrative muscle to make him return the land to the tribes. It was just one of a large number of cases of politicians and job seekers using fake caste certificates to win benefits.\nIndia's caste system remains a deeply entrenched reality, and despite laws, such as the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, social discrimination and atrocities against disadvantaged castes continue to persist. Of the country's 1.3 billion population, more than 40% belongs to disadvantaged castes, and 9% are tribal members.\n\"Nobody here knows what crypto is but ...\"\n\"Today, as a start, we are delivering 100 caste certificates, which are built on blockchain through a paper representation with a verifiable QR code,\" said Gupta, who is effectively the administrative head of the Etapalli subdivision of Gadchiroli in the state of Maharashtra.\nOf the region's population of 250,000, roughly 80%, or 200,000, are tribal members. The first phase of the project will see the delivery of certificates to 65,000 members.\n\"Everyone thinks of development as providing basic livelihood needs like food, bamboos for shelter, a cow or a goat (through animal husbandry schemes), but nobody has thought of equity for them, probably because the people here are not tech savvy,\" Gupta said. \"So, what I tried to do was give them equity through exposure so that their children may learn about blockchain and do something in the future.\"\nWhile the implementation is being done by a three-man government team led by Gupta, Legit Doc – a private platform using blockchain to make tamper-proof digital documents that was commissioned through a government process – brought the idea to life on the Polygon protocol.\n\"We are using polygon to make caste certificates impossible to forge and easily verifiable,\" said Neil Martis, co-founder and project lead at LegitDoc.\nGupta sold shoes as a child\nAs a 15-year-old, Gupta used to work in his father's shoe shop in Dahanu, a small town his family had moved to after suffering setbacks in the major northwestern city of Jaipur.\n\"My sister and I had no option but to take a 5:50 a.m. train from Dahanu to Vapi everyday,\" recalled Gupta. \"As a bigger city, Vapi offered us proper schooling. We would take the return train at 1:30 p.m. so that I could come back by 3 p.m. to run the shoe shop till 10 p.m.\"\nGupta made four attempts to get a top rank in the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), India's premier central recruitment agency for all Group \"A\" officers. He didn't qualify the first time, but ranked sixth in the country in his final attempt.\n\"It was during my preparations for the UPSC exams that I was fascinated by blockchain technology,\" Gupta said.\nIn a coincidence, Gupta's blockchain caste certificate project happens to be starting on the same day when India for the first time has elected a tribal member as its president, with Droupadi Murmu garnering a majority of votes.",

Developers can set predefined conditions that Keepers continuously checks, and when those conditions are met, it will trigger the smart contract’s function.\nVRF, on the other hand, uses on-chain “randomness” that can generate fair in-game outcomes in blockchain games or randomly select governance participants for specific tasks.\n“Having Chainlink VRF on Fantom allows our ecosystem developers to incorporate tamper-proof unpredictable outcomes into their dapps,” Michael Kong, CEO at Fantom Foundation, wrote in a Telegram message. “That (can) be for GameFi and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) or other real-world use cases.”\nVRF has already handled more than 7 million requests from decentralized applications on other networks, developers at Chainlink Labs told CoinDesk.\nChainlink handled over $1.85 billion in 5,630 transactions over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The transaction count has declined since a peak last month of 10,440 over a 24-hour period amid a slide in the broader crypto market.\nDeFi applications on Fantom hold just under $1 billion in locked value, according to DeFiLlama.

On Solana, new users peaked at over 400,000 in May before gradually declining to 240,000 users this week. These figures are a jump from December 2021’s levels of 150,000 to 170,000 new users each day.\nDaily active wallets have similarly climbed this year, with over 32 million active users in June and 37 million in May. This rose from an average of 20 million active users in the first four months of 2022.\nHowever, data suggests the activity did not amount to inflows.

    "title": "The Problem Tornado Cash Raises About Base Layer Censorship on Ethereum",
    "summary": "Requiring validators and others to censor blocks would be an unwarranted expansion of sanctions law.",
    "content": "On an otherwise quiet day last month, the crypto industry woke up to big news – the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added 45 public Ethereum addresses to the sanctions blacklist, including addresses where the Tornado Cash byte code, or smart contract, was stored, potentially rendering interactions with those addresses a violation of law. Up to this point, all addresses included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) had been wallets purportedly belonging to known “bad actors,” making the Tornado Cash sanctions an unprecedented expansion of sanctions law.\nIn essence, Tornado Cash is a mixer that decouples the sender and recipient of crypto to protect users’ privacy in an otherwise public network. But “Tornado Cash” is not a company or an entity; it’s a decentralized, immutable, non-custodial smart contract. Therefore, industry participants were quick to argue that OFAC overstepped its authority when it added a smart contract address to the SDN List, given that its statutory power is limited to sanctioning “persons” or “entities” – and a smart contract is clearly neither. A recent lawsuit also makes clear the catastrophic implications that the Tornado Cash sanctions had for a variety of actors, including people who are trying to preserve their privacy while making donations to Ukraine.\nRodrigo Seira is crypto counsel at Paradigm. Amy Aixi Zhang is policy counsel at Paradigm.\nBut the most pernicious result of the OFAC sanctions is they have the potential to be misinterpreted by “base layer” participants – which includes validators and other actors such as builders, pool operators, relays, searchers and sequencers – as requiring the censorship of blocks involving sanctioned addresses. This basically means that base layer participants would either exclude any sanctioned addresses in blocks they propose, or refuse to attest to any blocks that include such sanctioned addresses. Either action could result in the respective network becoming censored by default or “forking” into two incompatible versions.\nSimply put, this is not the right way to interpret the law. Crypto’s “base layer” is not legally required to monitor or censor blocks involving addresses on the SDN List in order to comply with sanctions just as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that enables the transfer and interoperability of email would not be responsible for monitoring spam or illegal activity.\nSee also: In Crypto, Base Layer Security Isn't Enough - CoinDesk | Opinion\nSanctions are a legitimate tool of the U.S. government, and OFAC, the regulator tasked with enforcing sanctions, has broad statutory authority to which U.S. courts have historically deferred. But the function of crypto’s base layer – publicly recording the order of data blocks – does not entail the type of financial transactions and other activities that are prohibited by sanctions. Critically, sanctions require U.S. persons to employ compliance programs that are “risk based” and tailored to the specific activities in question, not to completely shut down all activity if there is a chance of a sanctions violation.\nWhen OFAC designates a party to the SDN List, U.S. persons are prohibited from transacting with them and required to “block” their property. However, crypto’s base layer is not transacting with sanctioned parties – whether a transaction is confirmed on a blockchain network depends on the broader, global network consensus, regardless of the actions of any individual participant.\nCrypto’s base layer participants are also not able to “block” the property of a sanctioned party in the manner that a bank can freeze an account. At no point is any base layer participant in “possession or control” of property of a sanctioned person. Therefore, censorship as applied to crypto’s base layer amounts to an inability to report a transaction; not an ability to “block” it.\nSee also: Crypto Donations Are About More Than Censorship-Resistance | Opinion\nSanctions also prohibit U.S. persons from “facilitating” transactions with designated parties, including providing “services” to such parties. OFAC has applied these prohibitions broadly when a U.S. person “assists” or “supports” transactions involving sanctioned parties. Nonetheless, construing the actions of crypto’s base layer as “facilitating” transactions or providing “services” would be at odds with prior OFAC regulations and enforcement history.\nThe public recording of the order of data blocks by crypto’s base layer is no more “facilitating” a transaction with sanctioned parties or providing “services” than the existing communications infrastructure that routes financial messages daily around the world, whether through internet service providers, routers, network switches, email and chat programs, and other network protocols.\nRead more: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Opinion\nOFAC regulations have also stated that “facilitating” does not include activities that are of a purely clerical or reporting nature, which is the core function of crypto’s base layer. Further, the fact that crypto’s base layer infrastructure has been decentralized by distributing basic functions to independent participants makes each individual actor’s actions even less likely to meet this threshold.\nOFAC’s recently released FAQs on Tornado seem to support our interpretation of the scope of compliance obligations by focusing on transactions between parties sending digital assets to sanctioned addresses, as opposed to the activities of the base layer. They state that “interacting with open-source code itself, in a way that does not involve a prohibited transaction with Tornado Cash, is not prohibited.”\nRequiring the base layer to censor blocks would be an unwarranted expansion of sanctions law. It would also be counterproductive and potentially harm national security interests, which is contrary to both OFAC’s stated goals and U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent executive order. The requirement to censor blocks under the threat of sanctions liability is likely to lead many participants of crypto’s base layer, including important on- and off-ramps, to go offshore. This would limit the U.S.’s ability to influence the development of the technology and result in U.S. regulators having less visibility into transactions.\nCensorship at the base layer would also undermine the utility of blockchain technology. Like the telephone network, crypto’s base layer is at its core a communications protocol and part of the technological infrastructure that should be considered a public good. Its key function – publicly recording the order of data blocks – is similar to the role we expect the core internet infrastructure (like TCP/IP) to play, to freely and accurately disseminate information through the network. To maintain its utility, crypto’s base layer must also maintain its neutrality and lack of bias.\nOur more extensive analysis on this topic can be found here.

    "summary": "After a botched launch in March, the blockchain has relaunched with new tools for users looking to claim airdropped tokens.",
    "content": "After months of hype ended in a botched launch in March, Evmos – the blockchain that aimed to improve Ethereum and Cosmos interoperability – is relaunching on Wednesday.\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, IBC-enabled Evmos blockchain was initially slated to launch in February as a way to fold Ethereum development into the Cosmos ecosystem. With strong community backing and innovative plans for a token airdrop, the chain seemed poised for success.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nYet, when Evmos launched in March after a short delay it was plagued by bugs and reports of users struggling to claim their airdropped tokens.\nAfter an attempted update led to a “critical security vulnerability,” Evmos’s issues became large enough that validators coordinated to halt the entire chain.\n“We decided as a community of validators and on the core team to just take a step back and try it again once we have everything sorted out,” said Evmos founder Federico Kunze Küllmer in an interview with CoinDesk.\nNow, a month and a half after Evmos shut down, the team feels it is ready to try again.\nLessons learned\nOver the past month, the Evmos team has worked to make it easy for users to claim tokens that were lost during Evmos’s buggy March airdrop.\nAs a part of this effort, the team is introducing a dashboard that, in addition to allowing users to stake their tokens and participate in protocol governance, will enable users to claim airdropped tokens.\n“We implemented additional checks on the claiming process and we also introduced our recovery for all the funds that were stuck,” said Kunze Küllmer. “We also have a clear guide for how to claim the tokens and how to recover tokens permanently stuck.”\nAfter a long list of complicated integrations brought down Evmos in March, Kunze Külmer said that “the main thing that we did as well from an engineering point of view is improve our testing processes and testing procedures.”\nIn explaining Evmos’s new testing procedures, Kunze Külmer pointed CoinDesk to new documentation the team has created for Evmos users and developers. In addition to keeping Evmos on track, the documentation will serve as a point of reference for members of the wider Cosmos community looking to learn from Evmos’s mistakes.\n“We have these software upgrade guides for all our users so that not only we can benefit from the learning experience that we had with these failed upgrades, but other users in the Cosmos ecosystem can benefit,” explained Kunze Külmer.\nEthereum + Cosmos = Evmos\nCosmos is an interconnected community of blockchains that communicate via the so-called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. In a world where new blockchains are popping up each day to cater to unique use cases, IBC makes it easy for distinct blockchains to swap assets and interoperate without the need for specialized tooling.\nOver the past couple of years, Cosmos has scaled into one of the largest blockchain ecosystems, with popular IBC-enabled chains like Terra and Osmosis reaching a combined market cap of nearly $70 billion, according to Cosmos builders Ignite.\nAs Cosmos and other blockchain ecosystems have expanded, Ethereum continues to house most decentralized app development. Even as new non-Ethereum chains have stolen some of its spotlight, many of the most popular newer chains – among them Avalanche, Fantom and Polygon – are built to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nBy making Evmos EVM-compatible, it will be easier for Ethereum-native developers to launch apps on the chain without extra overhead. It should also lead to a smoother experience for Ethereum users because they won’t need to ditch familiar tools like MetaMask.\nEvmos initially planned to relaunch on Tuesday, but it opted to push the launch back 24 hours to Wednesday at 6 p.m. UTC. Per a tweet from the Evmos Twitter account, “Evmos cannot launch without 100% confidence that we are ready to rock.”",

    "summary": "The plan to put Terra back on track after last week’s implosion was made live this morning, but online poll results suggest the community is against the move.",
    "content": "Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon on Wednesday morning announced an on-chain governance proposal even as results from a preliminary online poll on a hard fork plan found minimal backing among community members.\n\"Terra governance prop #1623 to rename the existing network Terra Classic, LUNA Classic ($LUNC), and rebirth a new Terra blockchain & LUNA ($LUNA) is now live,\" Kwon tweeted. He added that the proposal had the support of over 15 \"Terra builders.\"\nA hard fork means the splitting of a chain on which a certain protocol runs with different rules than the existing one, resulting in two separate blockchains. One chain then becomes the “main” one, even as both the blockchains continue to exist as long as there is validator and community support.\nAs per the proposal, the new chain would entirely cut out the failed UST product and instead focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications building on Terra, as reported. The current chain would continue as Terra “Classic,” while holders of LUNA on the “Classic” chain would receive a token airdrop of the new chain’s token under the plan.\nAt writing time, some 64% of voters on the on-chain proposal supported the fork, while 34% voted against it.\nThe community, however, is apparently not on board. Some 92% of over 6,220 voters on a previously held online poll have voted against the change, with the most popular responses calling for “no fork.”\nVotes to the off-chain, online poll can be made by anyone regardless of if they hold luna (LUNA) tokens, unlike on-chain governance polls that require voters to stake luna before casting votes. Most comments on the proposal’s discussion are negative. Some even term it “anti-community,” while others urged legal intervention.\nWhy are most voting no?\nMarket observers say a lack of trust in Terra and Kwon could have skewed the online preliminary poll voting towards being overwhelmingly negative.\n“The primary challenge the Terra community has against a new fork as proposed by Do Kwon is trust,” said Dmitry Mishunin, founder of DeFi security firm HashEx, in a Telegram chat. \"Should the team choose to proceed with the new fork, there will be a need to increase trust.”\n“As such, Terra needs to approach the fork with all responsibility and make additional checks for vulnerabilities,” Mishunin added.\nAnton Gulin, a regional director at crypto exchange AAX, seconded the comment: “The overall sentiment towards Luna across the crypto community is exceptionally harmful. Traders and investors suffered tremendous losses and doubt management’s actions that followed the UST unpegging.”\n“Anything incoming from Luna’s team may be treated in the same way as the lack of trust prevails. It’s rather a speculative asset now than a representation of a tier 1 ecosystem. The chances of a consensus are very low,” Gulin added.\nMeanwhile, some prominent fund managers say Terra’s senior team could fork the blockchain regardless of the community’s sentiment toward the project.\n“It's a dilemma for Kwon and Terra’s team as they can technically override the community's consensus by either forking regardless of the decision or using their staked Luna (to prevent the network from being manipulated) to change the voting to support,” Doo Wan Nam, founder of crypto fund Stable Node, in a Telegram chat.\n“This will be received very poorly by not only the Terra community but the wider crypto community. However, Do and his team might not have much choice but to do it to better reflect his vision of the Terra ecosystem,” Doo added.\nAlthough still a proposal, if a majority of network validators and the community were to approve the plan, the new network could be launched as soon as May 27, Kwon said in tweets earlier this week.\nLast week, Terra’s LUNA tokens fell 99.7% as its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lost its peg and dropped to under 10 cents, causing an outflow of funds from the Terra ecosystem and declining sentiment for the project among the crypto community.",

RedStone, which currently delivers data feeds to more than 30 blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche and Polygon, will use the funds to expedite the rollout of its latest product suite with the aim of improving connectivity between blockchains and real-world data.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nLemniscap founder Roderik van der Graaf said in the release it’s important that essential DeFi infrastructure, like the firm’s cross-chain oracle, continues to evolve to support the sprawling DeFi sector.\n“While the DeFi space continues to provide fertile ground for innovation, the foundational infrastructure has remained static over time, and is not fit for purpose in today’s rapidly scaling, blockchain-agnostic environment,” said van der Graaf.\nOracles are essential to the DeFi sector because they enable smart contracts to access real-time data, such as digital asset prices, eliminating the need for a central intermediary.\nRead More: What Is an Oracle?\nRedstone Oracle aims to offer quick and inexpensive connectivity by leveraging a proprietary method for putting data on blockchains, called the EVM connector. This method is intended to quickly and economically aggregate data from external sources like the foreign exchange market and price feeds for long-tail tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and commodities as the data automatically attaches itself to a transaction and erases itself. Currently, RedStone Oracle passes data packages into transaction call data by accessing over 1,000 data feeds, which are updated every 10 seconds.\nThe company is also developing a more efficient framework for smart contracts to increase interoperability between blockchains and external data sources.\nRedStone founder Jakub Wojciechowski said RedStone’s framework for smart contracts will be capable of processing more information, allowing the company's developers to improve on-chain-off-chain connectivity.\n“We want to create a smart contract framework that will allow everyone to process large volumes of data,” Wojciechowski told CoinDesk. “That's something which is not possible in other spaces.”\nRead More: Making Sense of Blockchain Smart Contracts",

    "summary": "Blocks of information are linked on a virtual chain, creating a shared, unchangeable digital record of all transactions.",
    "content": "While blockchain is often synonymous with cryptocurrency, the technology has a range of uses across industries. These days you can find blockchains being used to store asset data ranging from real estate purchases to supply chain management in sectors including health care and education.\nIn all use cases, blockchain functions as a shared, unchangeable digital record of all transactions, called blocks.\nHere’s how blocks are added to the blockchain.\nWhat is a blockchain?\nA blockchain, also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), is a decentralized record of transactions that is constantly reviewed and updated. Virtually any asset can be tracked by a blockchain network, though the technology is widely associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which each have their own associated blockchain network.\nIn the past, transactions were tracked and stored by financial institutions, and auditing that information was often time consuming and limited to certain privileged parties.\nBlockchain technology makes record keeping transparent and allows it to be shared across networks. No single party can change a transaction after it has been added to the ledger, and automated tools called smart contracts can execute transactions without requiring an intermediary like a bank. In addition, there is no single master copy of the blockchain; instead, the information is cross-checked (validated) by other computers (nodes) in the network.\nIn short, blockchain technology can enhance security, create greater trust and speed up transactions within a network.\nHow does blockchain work?\nBroadly speaking, the two main components of blockchains are the blocks of information and the infinite virtual chain that connects and tracks that information.\nHere are a few additional key terms to understand:\nThere are several longstanding technologies that work together to power a blockchain. Cryptography refers to securing information by transforming it so that only the intended recipient can process it. Blockchain uses two types of cryptographic keys – a public key and a private key – to create a secure digital identity. A distributed network is then used to validate transactions and keep the network secure. The entire process is governed by a unique set of rules called a protocol.\nHow are blocks added to a blockchain?\nThere are different consensus mechanisms used to verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. In cryptocurrency, the most common methods are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.\nBitcoin was introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" and was the first major application of blockchain technology. It uses a proof-of-work consensus method to create new blocks and enter new bitcoins into circulation. This method verifies transactions through mining, and users who verify transactions are known as miners.\nBecause there is no central authority, transactions are managed and new coins are issued collectively by the network.\nHere's an example of how a bitcoin transaction would take place:\nSay User A wants to send 1 bitcoin (BTC) to User B.\nWhen User A initiates a transaction, information about the sender and receiver is packaged and timestamped on a block and sent to a queue called a mempool (short for memory pool) where it will wait to be validated and added to the blockchain.\nMiners that have successfully discovered blocks will take batches of transactions and verify that all of the information, including digital signatures, messages and public keys, are legitimate.\nOnce the information is verified, the block is broadcast to all the nodes in the network, who must check and agree that the block is valid before adding that block to the official chain. The average time it takes to confirm a bitcoin transaction is about 10 minutes.\nWhen the process is complete, User B will have received 1 BTC sent to them by User A, all nodes on the network will have agreed to the transaction using the chosen consensus model and a bitcoin miner will have earned a reward for verifying a successful transaction. New blocks of information about that transaction are now linked to each other as part of an infinite and public chain.\nFuture blockchain uses\nToday, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that run on dozens of blockchain networks, though blockchain technology has practical uses that extend beyond cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain networks, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, are continuing to upgrade their networks, integrating new ways to become more efficient, energy conscious and cheaper than ever before.",

    "content": "Fantom community members have passed a governance vote that proposed using one-third of the network’s burn fees to fund new projects built in the Fantom ecosystem. Nearly 100% of all votes cast were in favor of the plan.\nThe proposal had been scheduled to run until Oct. 3, but voting closed after support crossed the minimum 55% requirement.\nFantom currently burns – i.e., permanently removes from circulation – 30% of all tokens that are paid as network fees. Following the vote, one-third of that 30% fee value would be submitted to an “Ecosystem Support Vault” held via a Special Fee Contract (SFC).\nThe SFC is controlled by the Fantom network validators and stakers via on-chain governance and community proposals. The remaining two-thirds of transaction fees would be burned as usual.\nPayments will initially be manually executed via the Fantom Foundation, using tools such as LlamaPay, to fund projects whose proposals are approved by the Ecosystem Vault.\nDevelopers say community members must add vesting periods to the payments to ensure project founders are incentivized to work continuously, instead of receiving the payments at once and possibly losing interest.\nRisks outlined by the now-passed proposal include malicious approvals of projects requesting funds from the Ecosystem Vault, influential entities or groups funding themselves or promoting projects they control and a project that overpromises and cannot deliver with the received funds.\nMeasures, however, are in place to combat those risks. “Fantom reserves the right to halt any payment stream indefinitely if fraudulent user activity is suspected or if the Foundation believes it presents a negative risk to the Fantom ecosystem,” developers said in the proposal.",

    "summary": "There are four main kinds of the technology used in the crypto, NFT and Web3 sectors.",
    "content": "You may have come across the term “blockchain” on social media or online news covering cryptocurrency or during a conversation on the future of technology. In a nutshell, blockchain serves as a shared, unchangeable, digital record of pieces of information (such as transactions) stored in computers or servers.\nSee Also: What Is Blockchain Technology?\nBenefits of blockchain\nBoth blockchain and cryptocurrencies are frequently associated with each other by definition, because cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to exist. They aren't the same, but the blockchain technology that underpins crypto does offer many benefits, including the following:\nFour kinds of blockchain\nPublic\nA public blockchain is permissionless, meaning it is fully decentralized and anyone can participate in it. This allows users with an internet connection to access, download and join the blockchain as an authorized node. All the nodes within the blockchain have equal rights to access and interact with the network. This kind of blockchain is often used for exchanging and mining cryptocurrency. The most widespread consensus mechanisms used in public blockchains are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.\nPros of a public blockchain:\nCons:\nExamples of public blockchains:\nPrivate\nA private blockchain is \"permissioned,\" meaning only some people are allowed to participate in it. This kind of blockchain is controlled by a company or organization, which determines who is granted access and enables read and write access to permissioned users on the network. The size of the private blockchain is generally smaller because it is a restrictive environment. As such, a private blockchain functions within the network of the controlling entity.\nPros:\nCons:\nExample:\nHybrid\nA hybrid blockchain is a kind of blockchain network that combines features of both public and private blockchains. The blockchain network is controlled by one entity. It provides an organization with control over who can access specific data stored in the blockchain and what data will be open to the public.\nFor instance, XinFin’s hybrid blockchain makes it versatile in solving any underlying challenges within the finance and global trade sectors.\nIts current blockchain infrastructure has both a public and private state. XinFin’s private state ensures that sensitive financial data remains secure, while the public state makes data transparent and verifiable.\nXinfin’s system has been used for remittance, peer-to-peer trading platforms, blockchain-powered insurance and online digital asset-linked identity, showing the versatility and various use cases of a hybrid blockchain.\nFurthermore, members of the hybrid blockchain can also decide who can engage within the blockchain and which transactions are revealed to the public.\nPros:\nCons:\nExample:\nConsortium\nA consortium blockchain or a federated blockchain is more decentralized than a private blockchain. Unlike the hybrid blockchain with one controlling entity, a consortium blockchain is designed by a group of multiple entities that want to use a decentralized network to collaborate. Users outside of the consortium cannot get access to the blockchain network.\nOne of the largest systems using the consortium blockchain is R3, which includes Fortune 500 companies among its member entities. The purpose of R3’s network is to promote collaboration globally among organizations, such as creating apps built on their network.\nPros:\nCons:\nExample:",

    "summary": "Bitcoin's Puell Multiple and MVRV Z-Score indicate the cryptocurrency is undervalued. Similar readings have marked bear market bottoms in the past.",
    "content": "It's time to start stacking bitcoin again. That's the message from indicators tracking tokens sold by miners and comparing the cryptocurrency's market value to its fair value.\nThe Puell Multiple, calculated by dividing the daily issuance of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day average of the value, has dropped into a \"green zone\" below 0.5, indicating the newly minted coins are undervalued relative to the yearly average.\nIn other words, the current profitability of those responsible for minting coins is relatively low. In the past, that's indicated a perfect opportunity to build long-term exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\"Entering the green zone is a good time to average in, and for those more conservative, you can also wait for confirmation with a move out of the accumulation zone,\" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in a newsletter published on Sunday.\nThe daily issuance refers to coins added to the network by miners, who receive them as rewards for verifying a new block of bitcoin transactions. Recently, many miners have reduced their crypto holdings to stay afloat as the value of the reward has fallen.\nUndervalued readings on the Puell Multiple have marked previous bear market bottoms.\n\"The Puell Multiple has reached a territory consistent with market bottoms in the past (below 0.5 and even touching levels below 0.4 a few weeks ago),\" said Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at South Korea-based blockchain data firm CryptoQuant.\nPrevious sub-0.5 readings observed between March 2020 and May 2020, November 2018 and January 2019, November 2014 and April 2015 and during the final quarter of 2011 coincided with peak selling and bear market bottoms. While China's mining ban in June 2021 perhaps distorted the indicator, it still coincided with a market bottom.\nEssentially, the metric entered the green zone in the last leg of the bear market, following which the downward momentum weakened, allowing for weeks of price consolidation and a subsequent revival.\nOne question is whether signals from miner flows are reliable, given the sales now constitute a only small portion of overall flows.\n\"If all newly issued bitcoin were immediately sold on the market each day, it would equate to only 900 BTC of selling pressure, which represents just 1%-1.5% of total daily volume,\" crypto exchange Coinbase said in a recent research report.\nAnalysts, however, retain confidence in the multiple's predictive powers. \"Mining is still the backbone of the network, whether the portion [of miner flows] is small or not. This is why the metric gets higher importance in our opinion, irrespective of narratives. The metric is not invalidated yet,\" cryptocurrency intelligence firm Jarvis Labs told CoinDesk.\nCryptoQuant's Moreno said, \"Miner flows continue to represent an important volume of bitcoin flowing to exchanges, and the Puell Multiple is calculated using the USD value of new bitcoin issued, which is higher on average than it was in 2018 or 2014-15.\"\nIndicators including the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score and long-term moving average crossovers also indicate the time is ripe for accumulation.\nThe MVRV Z-score, which measures the deviation of market value from realized value and is another indication of undervaluation, turned negative in mid-June.\nBitcoin's market value or capitalization refers to the total dollar value of the supply in circulation, as calculated by the daily average price across major exchanges. The realized value approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by summing the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain.\nThe realized value adjusts for lost coins and is closer to the fair value of the cryptocurrency. Therefore, the Z-score representing the deviation of market value from the realized or fair value is tracked to gauge whether the cryptocurrency is undervalued or overvalued.\nHistorically, an MVRV Z-score below zero has marked bear market lows, while a reading above seven has marked major bull market tops.\nBitcoin was recently trading near $20,400, down 1% on the day. The cryptocurrency has dropped 55% this year, according to CoinDesk data.",

It has also launched a Web3 and gaming chain called Nova, the report said.\nRollups such as Arbitrum and rival layer 2 blockchain Optimism scale the Ethereum network by processing transactions and executing smart contracts – computer programs that run on some blockchains – on their own chains.\nBernstein said it expects a host of trading, gaming and non-fungible-token (NFT) projects to be released on the blockchain. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and that can be sold or traded.\nThe broker also noted speculation of a potential Arbitrum token launch in the near term, which could be used to reward early users.\nEthereum’s large user and developer base “will continue to act as a feeder to rollups,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote, adding that they “expect a new growth cycle to emerge in crypto as rollups drive mainstream application building on Ethereum.”\nLayer 2 blockchains are “providing the first proof of concept that rollups work while relying on the security and settlement network of Ethereum,” the note said. “This retains the relevance of Ethereum and makes it competitive versus peers.\"\nArbitrum recently paid about 400 ether, worth about $530,000 at the time, to a hacker who flagged a vulnerability in the upgrade. Developers behind the scaling tool had missed a change that would have allowed attackers to steal all funds sent to the network.\nRead more: NFT Marketplace OpenSea to Support Ethereum Roll-Up Arbitrum\nCORRECTION (Sept. 22, 15:47 UTC): Corrects dollar value of ether in last paragraph.

    "title": "Autodidacts Welcome!",
    "summary": "Universities may teach blockchain but the crypto community will always embrace the self-taught. This story is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.",
    "content": "If you hang around long enough in the crypto space you’ll soon hear the word “autodidact.” As defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary it means simply “a self-taught person.” The space is chock-full of autodidacts.\n“Ninety-five percent of the people in the space are self-taught,” said Isaiah Jackson, an autodidact and author of “Bitcoin & Black America.” “They do their own research and they find their own sources.”\nThis article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's ranking for the best universities for blockchain in 2022.\nJust a few examples: Craig Wright is an autodidact, once described by Wired as “an almost obsessive autodidact and self-claimed double-Ph.D.” Nick Szabo is an autodidact, once telling Tim Ferriss that “my smartest teachers, mentors, peers these days are all on Twitter and blogs and they’re mostly autodidacts.” Vitalik Buterin is an autodidact who learned about bitcoin when he was still in high school, explaining that “I was definitely curious and read a bunch of books.”\nButerin was such a promising self-learner that in 2014 he received a grant from Peter Thiel, another crypto-friendly autodidact (among other things), who awards annual $100,000 grants that are, essentially, juicy prizes for autodidacts. Thiel neatly summed up the ethos of autodidactism, saying at the time: “We hope the 2014 Thiel Fellows inspire people of all ages as they demonstrate that intellectual curiosity, grit and determination are more important than credentials for improving civilization.\"\nSee also: The Educator-Entrepreneurs of Crypto\nWhy is there such a strong overlap between crypto and autodidacts? “It’s a natural filter,” said Erik Voorhees, a longtime bitcoin bull and the founder of ShapeShift. “Crypto couldn’t be learned in institutions until recently,” he said over email, so anyone who chose this path by definition did so with their own grit and hustle. Or as he put it more elegantly, they’re “self-motivated enough to enter an unexplored pasture with no shepherd.”\nA classic autodidact story: Isaiah Jackson was a high school teacher in 2013. He heard about Bitcoin from a roommate, then he immediately read the white paper. He then read it “100 more times.” He lurked on websites like Reddit and Bitcoin Talk Forum. “There wasn’t a lot of information in 2013,” said Jackson. “You really had to search for info.”\nMagdalena Gronowska learned the same way. “Most people got into this space through being self-taught,” said Gronowska, aka @Crypto_Mags. “Whether that’s through podcasts or tinkering or experimenting with the technology themselves.” Learning by doing: Setting up wallets, running their own nodes, sending and receiving tiny transactions just to see how it all works.\nThis brand of self-learning gumption, said Gronowska, even serves as its own kind of credential for employment. Gronowska cheekily calls this “Proof of Work,” meaning that people prove they’ve done their own self-education homework. “They [crypto companies] want to know that you actually understand it,” said Gronowska, who added that when she’s interviewing candidates for jobs, she’ll sometimes ask them to point to a Twitter thread they wrote about a crypto topic, or even a Medium post they felt compelled to write.\nThose who are crypto-curious tend to also be just plain curious. The autodidactism can be sprawling. Vitalik Buterin taught himself to speak Chinese, Nick Szabo is both a cryptographer and legal scholar, and Isaiah Jackson is a history buff who’s now geeking-out on the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius. “Anything that I wanted to learn, I always start with myself,” said Jackson. As a high school teacher he tried to impart that mindset to his students, telling them, “If you have a question, ask yourself first. You do realize you have a $1,000 computer in your pocket.”\nSometimes these interests feed directly into a broader understanding of crypto – such as Erik Voorhees devouring books on Austrian Economics – but sometimes they’re just for kicks. “I don’t feel like anything I do is very useful,” said Des Dickerson, the CEO of THNDRgames. She’s kind of joking but kind of not, saying that she gets obsessed with “weird things.”\nOne of these weird things is “urban snail farming,” as Dickerson explained that she loves to eat escargot but in the United States, “the escargot is [crap].” She was curious to find out the reasons why, then she did a deep dive into the international shipping and transport of snails, and then she even acquired her own snails on the back market to develop her own urban snail farm. (“Don’t come for me, government!” Dickerson said with a laugh.)\nDickerson said she went “so hardcore into this” that she even approached a Michelin-starred restaurant, who invited her to source their snails. Then the coronavirus pandemic happened, she moved, and in the process all her snails died. The point of this little vignette is that Dickerson, like so many crypto autodidacts, is a self-starter who easily gets addicted to learning and questioning and even experimenting. “I get very addicted to things,” she said. “That’s why I don’t do drugs.”\nOr consider the autodidacts who believe so strongly in self-teaching – and also in crypto – that they instill this practice in their children, even when traveling around the world as nomads. “As a father, homeschooling allowed me a much closer view of my children’s educational development. I knew what they were learning and could be an active agent in their learning process,” writes Daniel Prince in “Choose Life: The Tools, Tricks, and Hacks of Long-Term Family Travellers, Worldschoolers and Digital Nomads.”\nPrince has four kids that he home-schools while he hops around the globe, and he’s also a bitcoin bull who runs a bitcoin podcast. He views home-schooling and bitcoin as linked: They’re both ways of empowering yourself without relying on a centralized (and potentially compromised) institution. “Homeschoolers are bitcoiners that just don't know it yet,” he once tweeted. “And vice versa.”\nBut for all the virtues of self-learning, is autodidactism itself a kind of privilege? Can you spend hours nerding-out on self-custody wallets and Lightning nodes if you’re a working mom, say, who’s trying to make ends meet? Jackson understands the criticism, but he views the self-education of bitcoin as a way to address privilege and reduce income inequality. “If you get into the space and you think that it’s important, you will find the time to learn about it,” he said. “Thirty minutes in the morning listening to a podcast when you’re working out, or when you’re getting ready, that can help tremendously, and it adds up over time.”\nQuestions of privilege aside, now the space is at something of an inflection point. As Voorhees pointed out, for most of crypto’s history the only way to truly learn was to teach yourself. This is changing. Universities are now incorporating blockchain and crypto into formalized programs (See: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022) and for the autodidacts this is a source of some ambivalence.\nJackson acknowledges that crypto’s new home in the education system is just a natural reflection of the space’s maturity. It happened in tech, too. “Now it’s regular for somebody to say, ‘I’ve majored in Computer Science,’” he said. “Whereas if you said that in 1992, it didn’t exist. You’d just say, ‘I know what I’m doing because I’ve tinkered around with computers.’” He believes that “once it enters the school system, it’ll just be a formalized way for businesses to have a pipeline of students.”\nSee also: Introducing Education Week: How to Learn About Web3\nThen again, Jackson likes that even if you earn that formal degree in crypto, “that doesn’t guarantee a job. It’s still about, what can you do? You still have to show an impetus to be self-taught.” Gronowska agrees, believing, “It’s not enough to take a course.” And she’s skeptical of the potential biases that could seep into a formalized blockchain education. “Imagine if Greenpeace were to write a course on crypto, or if [the World Economic Forum] were to write a course on crypto,” she said. “I’d rather see the [crypto] industry coming up with their own courses, because they might be a bit more objective.”\nVoorhees shares those concerns. “Crypto has been a frontier industry, laughed at or ridiculed by most traditional institutions,” he said, which meant that he had no choice but to be self-taught. “Perhaps there’s an important lesson that anything you’re taught in school is already not cutting edge or innovative. You can learn the status quo from institutions, but nothing radical.”\nUltimately, Voorhees connects self-education with the underlying ethos of bitcoin and decentralization itself. “There are technical skills related to blockchains and cryptography which can absolutely be taught in schools,” he said. “But the soul of this industry is one of rebellion against state-capture of money, and the drive toward rebellion must come from within.”",

    "content": "Bears be damned – the bulls geared up as thousands of participants in the crypto world descended upon Toronto this week for ETHToronto and the Blockchain Futurist Conference.\nBilled as Canada’s largest blockchain conference, the three-day event was held at two of Toronto’s most prominent nightclubs – Rebel and Cabana – which are known to be frequented by many A-list celebrities.\nCZ's 'Good Guy' Reputation; Money Laundering Risks of Crypto\nThe conference had a hackathon, panels, several fun activities, afterparties and a keynote by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who poked fun at monkey JPEGs. To top it all off, Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman rapped about interoperability and use cases for the ecosystem.\nRead more: ‘Hey, Look, It’s a Monkey!’ Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Pokes Fun at Ape NFTs, Expresses Optimism About the Merge\nMaybe it was the party atmosphere or the beautiful summer days of Toronto but, judging by the mood of the participants, it seemed like the audience felt that the crypto rout has bottomed out.\nOf course, it also helped that, during the conference, Ethereum network native token ether (ETH) hit its highest price since June, ahead of the network overhaul known as the Merge, which looks likely to happen next month.\n“For the first time in a long time, people were inspired again,” said attendee Greg Gopman, chief marketing officer of crypto infrastructure provider Ankr. “Maybe it was Vitalik showing up. Maybe it's news of the Merge nearing reality. Or maybe it was just the beautiful indoor-outdoor venue during two perfect Toronto summer days – but for the first time in a while, things felt bullish again.”\nThe main focus of the conference, aside from the obvious discussions on the Merge and decentralized finance (DeFi), included privacy and regulations, real-world applications of blockchain, interest in crypto from traditional finance (TradFi) and new technologies as well as a rare feat in crypto – female empowerment.\nThe Merge and beyond\nBetween the many bars at the conference and plenty of schmoozing at side events, the conference was buzzing with the excitement of the upcoming Merge, which will see Ethereum move from its proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake, as well as the improvements to the network that will be made beyond the upgrade to a more energy-efficient system.\nWhile Vitalik Buterin was upbeat about the Merge, Anthony Di Iorio, another co-founder of Ethereum, told the audience about the white-list opening of Andiami, a global tech project designed to add value to leading decentralized networks, which will be launched on Nov. 3 of this year, about 10 years to the day after the first Bitcoin meeting he hosted in Toronto.\n(Fun fact: Vitalik Buterin is Canadian and many people consider Canada the birthplace of Ethereum.)\nDi Lorio excitedly left the audience – not because of his new project but rather because he was in a rush to the hospital to welcome his newborn.\nAside from talks about Ethereum, other layer-2 representation also made its way around the conference.\n“There was a very optimistic crowd present in Toronto with layer 2 and the Merge at the forefront of discussion. It was great to see the level of collaboration between the variety of ecosystems and projects that were present, said Zack Gall, VP of communications at EOS Foundation.\nA layer-1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1.\nMetis, an Ethereum layer-2 rollup platform, also shared that participants in the conference seemed enthusiastic about layer-2 products, especially in a post-Merge world.\nKevin Liu, a co-founder of Metis, mentioned that there was “a lot of hype over Ethereum. We spoke about so many projects and we were excited to speak with everyone about Reputation Power on Matrix [Metis’ Web3 identity system], which will help drive mass adoptions of Web2 to Web3.”\nMeanwhile, interoperability among the blockchains was a big topic of discussion. In fact, after his keynote speech, Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman rapped about “interoperability and sovereignty.” Cosmos – described as the \"internet of blockchains,” a network of blockchains able to communicate with one another in a decentralized way – was pitched by him as one interoperability solution.\n“An interoperable, multichain ecosystem will be crucial to unlock growth for the crypto and blockchain industry,” said Viveik Vivekananthan, CEO of Swing, a Web3 liquidity infrastructure provider company.\nPrivacy\nWhat’s a blockchain conference without debate on privacy? There were plenty of discussions on the topic.\nDuring a panel discussion on privacy, Warren Paul Anderson of Discreet Labs, a blockchain research and development company building out Findora and other privacy protocols, said that there’s been a real push in the industry to put everything on the chain, because it protects “the ethos of decentralization.” But what is missing in the privacy space is trust, he said.\nAnderson believes that zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, which ensure that data can be shared without releasing personal information, will be able to solve this problem. This will be the next phase of innovation around privacy issues in blockchain, he said.\nRead more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups\nAnderson’s comment came right before the sanctioning of Tornado Cash, which made the need for privacy and regulations a much-debated topic. “Given the recent sanctioning of Tornado Cash, privacy seemed to be a hot topic of conversation at the Blockchain Futurist Conference this year,” he told CoinDesk.\nCrypto and everyday uses\nOn the more educational side, the opportunities to interact with blockchain and crypto in real life were endless at the conference.\nBy competing in dead hangs to win $1,000 in bitcoin, using cryptos via Flexa (a crypto-payments app to pay for food) and arriving by helicopter at the venue using payments in crypto, participants had ample opportunity to use crypto for “mainstream\" activities.\nTracy Leparulo, the main organizer of ETHToronto and the Blockchain Futurist Conference, spoke to CoinDesk about the conference’s launch of a real-life engagement token “to bring people close to real life and drive actions on site.”\n‘Won’t be caught dead’\nMeanwhile, TradFi interest in crypto was very prominent at the conference.\nLeparulo said that she has been running the conference since 2013, and before, the TradFi crowd wouldn’t even “be caught dead” coming to a crypto conference – the complete opposite of this year’s conference turnout.\n“The largest audience of this event this year is [made up of] people within traditional capital markets,” she said, adding that there were people from investment groups and stock exchanges at the conference, showing a shift in mindset about the crypto industry.\nIt's not surprising to see the intersection of TradFi and crypto, as recently there has been a continued push from the institutional investors to expand into the industry. Most recently, BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, has formed a partnership with publicly traded crypto-exchange Coinbase (COIN) to make crypto directly available to institutional investors.\nFemale empowerment\nIn a more surprising twist, the conference had a strong female representation, not just crypto bros.\nMaybe it's because the organizers were led by some prominent women in crypto.\n“The most inspiring part is that we had the largest submission to CryptoChicks bounty for the hackathon. A total of 13 projects led by women were submitted,” Metis and Cryptochicks CEO Elena Sinelnikova told CoinDesk.\n“We at Metis are so grateful that we were able to help organize this conference with Untraceable and CryptoChicks,” she added.\nLeparulo also mentioned that there was a big female turnout in Canada. She said, “[If] you're a female in this [blockchain] space, come to Futurist. It's a great inclusive area. I’m about to be eight months pregnant – I can do this. So if you're female in space, get on board and get into crypto. Anyone can do it.”\nPerhaps it's a sign that not just the sentiment was turning at this conference but also the social scene.",

    "summary": "The massive effort to rank the efforts of universities to teach the fast-growing and potentially transformative emerging technology of blockchain comes down to making informed choices. This article is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.",
    "content": "The third year of the CoinDesk Blockchain University Rankings is still, at heart, an attempt to both recognize the role that academic research has played in the development of blockchain technology as well as quantify the impact of individual schools. Our goal has not wavered in these three years: offer the most rigorous and nuanced window into universities’ impact on the blockchain field. Again this year, we’ve ranked schools across the globe with a final total of 240 universities, 15 of which came from outside nominations.\nThis piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week\nAbove all, we want to ensure that these rankings do what they’re intended to do: offer a holistic snapshot of the intersection between this transformative technology and institutions of higher education. It is our hope that, rather than being seen as canonical, a transparent, intellectually defensible ranking can help condense what ends up being an incredible amount of difficult-to-find information (with innumerable factors) down into a more manageable format.\nSample size\nOur official sample size for these rankings, at 240 individual schools, is not nearly the total number of universities that exist around the world. To determine which institutions to focus on, we added schools to the list according to their ability to meet any one of three criteria.\nFirst, we included any school that was listed in the top 150 of any one of the U.S. News and World Reports (USNWR) Best Global Universities (2022), the QS World University Rankings (2022), the ShanghaiRanking's Academic Ranking of World Universities (2022), or THE World University Rankings (2022). This gave us a large initial sample.\nRead More: The Best Universities for Blockchain 2022\nThis setup, however, if limited to just this criteria, could pose a problem: What if a lower-ranked school (as judged by USNWR, QS, ARWU or THE) is doing amazing work, but fails to be considered simply because a few outside sources happened to overlook them in their global rankings? This is far from a desirable outcome. On the other hand, we simply don’t have the resources to closely examine every school in existence, especially when relatively few of them are engaged in the kind of impactful blockchain work that is likely to lead to a place on our rankings.\nThis might be a good time to give a nod to schools that are vocational in nature, that aim to prepare their students for job skills including blockchain operational ability that are intended to enable a solid middle class life. These schools may not rank high in scholarly impact or global reputation, which likely prevents them from being captured by our initial screening process, but they are doing a great service to their students and society, and their existence should not go unmentioned.\nTo balance these considerations, similar to last year we added an additional criteria: We also included a call for any school, anywhere in the world, to request inclusion/consideration in our rankings. By opening up our criteria but placing the burden of requesting to be included on the schools themselves, we were able to remove artificial limitations on which schools were considered, while simultaneously maintaining a high level of confidence that any school that took the affirmative step of asking to be evaluated would ultimately be worth our time and resources to examine closely.\nThe 240 institutions that constituted our sample this year represent some of the best schools in existence today, including a mix of large, traditionally “elite” research institutions and smaller schools, from public to private, from free to expensive, with every continent (with the exception of Antarctica) represented.\nMethodology\nTo determine final scores, we looked at four primary categories: (1) an institution’s strength in research and academic contributions to advancing the field; (2) the existing blockchain offerings on campus, whether in the form of classes, educational centers, clubs, etc.; (3) employment and industry outcomes; and (4) overall academic reputation.\nEach category comprises multiple sub-categories, offering a holistic picture of a university’s presence in the blockchain space. For a final score, we assigned points to each institution proportional to their performance in each category, and normalized their final point totals on a scale from 0-100.\nScholarly impact\nTo determine a school’s scholarly impact score, we relied primarily on the Clarivate Web of Science database. We took the total number of publications (all subjects) from each school, and narrowed them to include only blockchain- or cryptocurrency-related papers published between 2018-2022 (including forthcoming papers slated for 2023). From this set we generated citation reports and created subsets in which the first author of the publication was affiliated with the university in question.\nRead More: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Where In the World Is the Most Research Being Produced?\nThe resulting data gave us the key metrics of (1) total blockchain research papers published by university affiliates, (2) how often these papers were cited, and rough numbers on (3) how often the primary researcher on a paper comes from a given institution (the “first author” convention being, of course, discipline-dependent).\nRaw numbers, however, don’t always tell the full story. A bigger school with a larger faculty and a hefty endowment, may be putting out more blockchain research overall (while still managing to devote a relatively small percentage of its resources to the field), while a tiny school that dedicates a much more impressive percentage of its overall resources to blockchain research may end up with fewer papers simply due to a smaller overall headcount.\nTo account for this, we also normalized each data point (where applicable) against the total institutional output. When normalized in this way, a smaller university that is devoting a larger proportion of its research to blockchain will be rewarded relative to a more massive university who is able to pump out a greater quantity of research with less investment. In recognition of the fact that both raw output and targeted output are valuable metrics, both are factored into our rankings, along with the aggregated H-Index of a school’s blockchain publications. For anyone interested in reproducing our dataset, please ensure that a) you have full access to the Web of Knowledge and all Clarivate subscriptions; and b) use our query to filter the results: “cryptocurrenc* OR ‘smart contrac*’ OR blockchai* OR bitcoi* OR ethereum OR stablecoi*”\nCampus blockchain offerings\nTo arrive at a school’s blockchain offerings score we examined multiple facets of their existing campus infrastructure. Campus course offerings are the largest single subcategory that we looked at. The number of available classes (especially when spread over multiple departments, providing an opportunity for a more robust education) shows a deep investment into the space both in the present and for the future. Faculty must be hired, curricula must be developed and administrative buy-in must be achieved. These are not done on a whim, and are usually quite permanent.\nThe second-largest factor in our rankings is the presence of a dedicated blockchain research center, although we also separately considered smaller initiatives and student-run clubs. Research centers and initiatives often offer unique opportunities for students to get involved in academic work or obtain hands-on experience, and can serve as a gravity well for novel ideas and thinkers (especially when these entities take the additional step of organizing conferences, summits, or other educational events). Research centers, initiatives and clubs all allow students, faculty and the larger community to connect with other enthusiasts, and tend to provide a crucial tether between academia and industry.\nLastly, to round out this category, we gathered data on the nascent but ever-growing set of universities who offer blockchain-related degrees, whether at the graduate or undergraduate level, and sometimes as a concentration within another degree. As a whole, the Campus Blockchain Offerings category is the most consequential component of our methodology.\nEmployment and industry outcomes\nA university’s ability to place students into relevant jobs is an important metric for two reasons: One, it says something about an institution’s cache in the industry, either due to name recognition, personal connections, or institutional pipelines; and two, this is of particular importance to current and incoming students.\nA student’s primary goal in obtaining a college education is, after all, often to secure a job in industry. To discover which schools are placing the most graduates in the blockchain field, we looked at the LinkedIn footprint of the largest and most influential companies in the space, as well as their thousands and thousands of employees. To mitigate biases we factored in both raw and normalized numbers wherever possible. Raw numbers are useful for highlighting schools that are placing a high number of graduates into jobs, but larger schools in larger countries will tend to have an advantage simply because of sheer size.\nTo gather qualitative data, we also surveyed industry stakeholders and other non-students, non-academics to get a sense of how institutions are (subjectively) viewed by those who consider themselves to be outside of academia. This data was quantified numerically, as was information about the number of active industry partnerships (including sponsored research) maintained by each university.\nAcademic reputation\nIn a perfect world, rankings would emphasize merit, and anonymized, quantifiable data would be sufficient to judge a university's impact in the blockchain space. Realistically, however, the intangibles of a school have an outsized impact on everything from a student’s job prospects, to their ability to get a foot in the door of an internship, to the caliber of speaker that will spend their limited time giving a talk at any given school.\nTo pretend that reputation doesn’t matter, that history is insignificant, is to do a disservice to our rankings. The effect of a school’s academic reputation on our methodology, however, is dwarfed by every other category except for cost, reflecting both the recent shift away from credentialism and the greater weight that we assign to more tangible, productive metrics.\nTo determine an institution’s reputation score, we looked at two criteria: (a) existing, overall reputation as calculated by USNWR, THE, ARWU, and QS; and (b) reputation as determined by our own qualitative surveys, which asked both practicing academics and current students to evaluate schools. This data was split according to whether it came from a student or an academic, and quantified numerically.\nSimilar to last year, there are two common threads in our methodology. First, in keeping with our goal of rigor, defensibility and reproducibility, we used externally verified, quantitative data (e.g., Web of Science) whenever such data was available and normalized this data where appropriate to add as much nuance into our rankings as possible. When we required qualitative data, we sent out open, public, shareable surveys through all available channels and did our best not to limit participation in any way, constructive or otherwise.\nSecond, we made every attempt to examine each data point from as many angles as possible. As is often the case, any given data point can be seen as a positive in some situations but a negative when seen through a different lens. Normalization is one tool to combat this, but so are things like common sense and a dispassionate analysis of the landscape. Data tells a story, and our goal was to let our data tell as complete a story as we could.\nHelp us improve our data\nIn important ways, rankings are incredibly useful for showing very specific data or reducing large amounts of information down into a digestible format, but are also both narrow and inherently malleable (yet another flaw, but perhaps one that can be discussed down here as it’s slightly, but only slightly, less panic-inducing).\nEven small changes to the methodology can have outsized effects on the final result, as can outlier data or even researcher-introduced errors. To state that rankings are vulnerable to criticisms of subjectivity and malleability is not intended to marginalize our data or the larger project at hand; rather, we hope that by highlighting the limitations of our output, these rankings will be more useful to a greater number of individuals.\nIn the open-source spirit, we’d also like to reiterate our commitment to integrity and data transparency. We are more than happy to discuss our methodology, share data, answer questions and address concerns. Interested readers are encouraged to contact Jeanhee Kim.\nWe hope that these rankings serve as the foundation for a living, breathing resource that goes well beyond an ordered list of schools. We have started and will continue to do this research, but we’re not naive enough to hold the impression that we can build this particular monument alone.\nBut we believe this resource illuminating one small corner of the blockchain universe has tremendous value – for students seeking a more traditional path into the industry, for academics hoping to collaborate with like-minded individuals, for companies wondering where specific research is being done. As a first step, we’ve started filling out profiles for some of the top universities, but we’d eventually like to have every school represented.\nStudents can contribute to this by checking their school(s) and having an authorized university representative (e.g., a member of the media/communications/etc. team) contact us if any information is outdated or missing, or if their school does not yet have a profile. Individuals can help by highlighting important research and projects or novel approaches to blockchain education. Schools can help by examining these rankings and using them as a signal for how to improve. Ultimately, what we can all do to help the space as a whole is simple: devote resources to educating students, faculty, and the community about blockchain technology.",

    "content": "Adelle Nazarian, CEO of the American Blockchain PAC, whose advisory board is led by W. Scott Stornetta, a physicist who was one of the inventors of blockchain technology, and Alex Allaire, co-founder and CEO of the American Blockchain Initiative, recently published a federal legislative road map in magazine National Interest’s Techland.\nThey compiled a list of 10 legislative proposals to protect investors without inhibiting innovation in the emerging blockchain sector. We are drilling down into the specifics of each of these at the National Interest here and there, at RealClearMarkets and now in this op-ed.\nRalph Benko is senior counselor to, and Todd White the founder of, the American Blockchain PAC.\nOne good way to protect the public without unduly burdening the blockchain sector would be to allow companies to elect to be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's digital commodity exchange regime. This was proposed by the Republican leader of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania. By reducing compliance costs without diluting consumer protection, it would provide a major boost to innovation.\nOne of the balancing acts involved in good lawmaking is making a smart cost/benefit analysis. Everyone agrees that we must protect the public. That doesn’t mean we should station a physician at every intersection, which might save a few lives, but at an exorbitant cost.\nTech to the rescue! A stop sign or traffic light will do.\nSee also: Responding to the 26 Anti-Crypto Technologists | Opinion\nThe startup challenge\nOne of the greatest challenges for innovators is raising the seed capital to finance a startup. Typically, this goes through three stages: friends and family, angel investors, venture capital. Founders typically work insane hours and live at a subsistence level to make every dollar count. At the friends-and-families and angel levels, their seed capital would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nBut filing for money transmitter licenses in all the states that require it would cost between $1 million and $1.5 million and would take up to two years, according to consulting firm Faisalkhan. That’s a deal killer, costing an order of magnitude (or more) greater than standard tech startup legal fees.\nIt’s preposterous. Bureaucracy runs amok, precluding innovation. These filings (and compliance costs) are wildly duplicative, an insane tangle of red tape. And to add injury to insult, this byzantine regulatory scheme has failed to deter many, many fraudsters.\nThe option of “one-stop shopping” at the highly competent CFTC, as proposed by Thompson, represents an act of statecraft. It is heartening to see a convergence between smart Republicans, like Thompson, and Democrats, like President Biden, who in his executive order on the responsible development of digital assets called for consumer protection and appropriate risk mitigation, stating the following:\n“The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system, particularly in setting standards that promote: democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture, and international payment systems.\nThe United States derives significant economic and national security benefits from the central role that the United States dollar and United States financial institutions and markets play in the global financial system. Continued United States leadership in the global financial system will sustain United States financial power and promote United States economic interests.”\nSee also: Does the US Government Have a Monopoly on Trust? | Opinion\nIn a release by the Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee, Thompson said the following:\n“Because of its oversight of commodity markets, the House Agriculture Committee plays a critical role in the exciting future of digital commodities. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to be leaders in the digital assets space to protect consumers, foster innovation, and reduce regulatory burdens.\nThe Digital Commodity Exchange Act can tackle those challenges, and I'm asking for the feedback of stakeholders, regulators and my colleagues in Congress to ensure we advance the best possible framework as American innovators build the next generation of digital infrastructure.”\nBipartisan support\nWe now observe a grand conjunction of great policy between the White House and the House of Representatives, between the Democrats and the Republicans, between those who prioritize vigilant protection of consumers and those who champion keeping America at the forefront of technological innovation and its attendant prosperity.\nWe, along with our colleagues Nazarian and Allaire, consider Biden’s executive order the most important presidential policy statement on technology since President John F. Kennedy’s 1962 Rice University speech launching American astronauts to the moon.\nThe federal government will have an extraordinary opportunity to make America great again beginning in January, with the convening of the 118th Congress, by introducing an omnibus bill enacting the policies most conducive both to public protection and technological innovation. That legislation should include Thompson’s proposal to allow tech companies to elect a federal money-transmitter license that preempts redundant state regulation.",

    "summary": "Blockchain technology provides a secure and open solution for transactions on-chain. For users seeking speed, anonymity and cost efficiency, conducting a transaction off-chain might make sense.",
    "content": "Blockchain technology can be used to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions without the need for a trusted third party like a bank. “On-chain” transactions carried out on a blockchain offer greater security and transparency, becausse they’re verified and recorded on a public distributed ledger that cannot be changed.\nBut blockchain transactions may include high fees and slow processing times, depending on the network’s verification method. For example, on the Bitcoin network, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of days to confirm a bitcoin (BTC) payment.\nOff-chain transactions are confirmed outside of the main blockchain network, often resulting in a cheaper and faster process for the user.\nHere are the differences between on-chain and off-chain transactions and when they're both used.\nWhat are on-chain transactions?\nOn-chain transactions refer to a transaction that is carried out on a blockchain network from start to finish. Once verified, the transaction is recorded on a blockchain network’s public ledger.\nHere’s how it works: When two parties want to trade cryptocurrency, information about the transaction is packaged and time-stamped on a digital collection of data called a block. That block is sent to an associated blockchain network where it waits to be validated by computers in the network called nodes and added to the blockchain.\nThere are different consensus mechanisms used to verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. Bitcoin, for example, uses a method called proof-of-work, which rewards miners for competing against each other using specialized computer software to solve extremely difficult computational puzzles to guess or match the “hash” and win the block reward. Newer methods like proof-of-stake don’t require mining computations but require participants to lock up a set amount of the native crypto token – their “stake” – to have a chance to be the validator for a block of transactions.\nEither process provides a high level of security and transparency because transaction data is public and constantly reviewed and updated by the network of miners or validators. However, the intricacy of the process means that it takes some time to process each transaction and add it to the blockchain.\nBenefits of on-chain transactions include:\nDisadvantages of on-chain transactions include:\nWhat are off-chain transactions?\nIn contrast, off-chain transactions transfer some of the work from a blockchain ecosystem, which can later be integrated back into a blockchain. On an off-chain network, the users agree that a third party will handle validating and authenticating transactions.\nOff-chain systems tackle a blockchain network's scalability issues by facilitating faster and cheaper transactions. One off-chain transaction method is to employ a layer 2, which is a second blockchain built on top of the main blockchain (mainnet) to help the mainnet scale in speed and cost. This takes transactions off the main chain to another chain, but for the purposes of this explainer, we’ll focus on other off-chain methods.\nRead more about layer 2 systems here.\nOff-chain transactions can be confirmed via:\nBenefits of off-chain systems:\nDisadvantages of off-chain methods vary by method but can include:\nFinal thoughts\nBlockchain networks provide security, transparency and ease of use when conducting a transaction. Still, some blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum remain limited in their scalability and sometimes require high fees to process transactions. Off-chain systems address these issues and promote faster processing speeds, lower fees and greater discretion.",

    "title": "On Starting a Crypto Career in the Dead of Winter",
    "summary": "An argument for taking the long view and studying blockchain or related technology now, even when prospects seem scary. This story is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.",
    "content": "This week at CoinDesk we’ve been highlighting the growing number of university programs that focus on blockchains and cryptocurrency. College isn’t necessarily a requirement for a solid career in the field, but for most people it’s the surest first step.\nThis piece is part of CoinDesk's Education Week.\nBut now may be a strange time to think about college, especially for those hoping for a career in crypto. After a two-year stretch of unprecedented hype, we’ve entered “crypto winter,” a recurring species of downturn that has proven typical of the blockchain industry as speculation outpaces adoption, then retreats.\nThe huge up-and-down cycles in crypto can certainly be nerve-wracking. And this time we’re also seeing signs of broader weakness in technology jobs, with a wave of headline-generating layoffs over the summer. It’s enough to make a young person second-guess career goals that had seemed like a slam dunk just a few months ago.\nBut recruiters with an eye on the tech world cite three good reasons learning about blockchain makes sense, even at a moment when it suddenly feels a bit less like The Next Big Thing.\nFirst, the skills that will get you in the door in crypto can be transferred without too much difficulty to other technology spheres. Second, anyone trained in computer science or coding will have relatively solid job prospects in nearly any kind of economy. And third, in crypto as in most fields, a downturn can actually make the early stages of a career easier in some ways by creating more freelance or gig work opportunities.\nAbove all, job-hunting experts say it’s important to think long term, even when news of layoffs and a slowing economy make it tempting to throw in the towel before you’ve even started.\nUnderstanding the downturn – and when it will end\n“Unfortunately, there’s a lot of discussions about hiring freezes and layoffs and the recession,” says Rick Chen of the tech-job discussion site Blind.\nBlind is an anonymized forum where verified employees speak freely about what they’re seeing at their workplaces and beyond, making it a very valuable source of job market insights. Chen is head of public relations at Blind, but he says most of his job is “being the in-house journalist” – watching the anonymous chatter on the site and extracting larger trends.\nChen says the looming economic downturn is causing particular worry for tech workers in three industries: real estate, fintech (including crypto) and the so-called gig economy. “People in corporate roles … at Instacart, Uber, Lyft. They’re concerned whether their business models are sustainable.”\nBut what’s behind the broad downturn in tech and crypto? In very broad strokes, COVID-19 is still in charge: Pandemic disruptions led to high inflation, and in turn central banks are raising interest rates both in the U.S. and worldwide.\nThat has a particularly sharp impact on so-called growth sectors of the economy, where companies often borrow money from investors to fund and market new ideas. When interest rates are higher that money tends to dry up because safer investments like bonds become relatively more attractive. That’s particularly worrying for companies like Uber that have been around for years but still show weak profitability and limited growth.\nCrypto also falls very much in the growth category: While some crypto firms have strong revenue even during the current downturn, many rely on investor funds of one sort or another as they work towards broader adoption. Those funds have become more scarce, dropping by half between 2021 and the first half of 2022. That means the current job doldrums, in crypto and in tech more broadly, could end in a couple of different ways: either investment revives, or more revenue starts flowing from customers.\nThe good news is that, unlike Uber, crypto is still considered a big future opportunity, so investment is still flowing in – just more slowly than at the peak of the last bull market. And even now there are still jobs to be had.\n“Despite this crypto winter, [blockchain firms] are still hiring,” says Chen. “No matter what, in terms of the state of the economy there are still some companies that need engineers, or need product managers. Those roles are kind of evergreen, so to speak.”\nTech is everywhere, and you can be, too\nJosh Brenner, CEO of the job market Hired, agrees there are still plenty of opportunities in the tech sector as a whole, despite some high-profile layoff rounds.\n“We started off the year with crazy aggressive hiring, and we’re now more at an efficient or stabilized kind of hiring for companies,” says Brenner. In many cases, the layoffs came from companies that were aiming to grow too fast and had to suddenly reverse course, rather than from companies that are shrinking or dying.\nRead more: Circle to Roll Out Free Crypto Literacy Program to HBCUs\nCrucially, many of the skills needed to work in crypto, especially in technical roles, are transferable to the broader tech sector, making coding, design and other skills the foundation for a robust career even if things get rocky in one specific industry.\n“Every company is a tech company now,” says Brenner. “If I were to pick a skill to pick up, technically related skills are going to serve people best into the future.”\nMore specifically, Brenner is seeing a growing crossover between blockchain and more traditional finance. “We’ve seen that while there has been a slowdown in hiring among crypto companies, a lot of banking and finance companies are hiring people with the crypto skills,” he says. “Obviously there’s a lot of need within banking for blockchain expertise.” To pick just one recent example of why, the stalwart banking infrastructure firm SWIFT this week announced a new partnership with the blockchain project ChainLink.\nOn the technical end of the spectrum, transferable skills come in basically two forms, according to Brenner. On the one hand there are specific programming languages or software tools that are used across a huge range of industries. A few of these are fairly consistent – learning Python, for instance, or how to manage a company’s Amazon Web Services. But Brenner recommends learners do their own research to figure out what skills are in demand, including searching job boards and monitoring the communities around specific coding languages.\nOn the other hand, says Brenner, “it’s the act of actually learning a new skill that companies look for.” In other words, the most important skill for employers may be the discipline and flexibility required to learn – which is very much the point of going to college.\nThat focus on basic skills extends to non-technical roles, where Brenner says good communication and organizational skills are paramount, “especially in this remote [work-from-home] world that most companies are going for now.” If you’re fascinated by blockchains and also a strong writer you have a lot of options, from technical copywriting to marketing.\nCompared with technical roles, though, it is a bit harder to prove your chops as, say, an email copywriter. Especially for coders, there are increasing opportunities to pass skills tests or earn specific certifications that can get your foot in the door, even without a college degree. Brenner says Hired is working to provide parallel alternatives for communications or other roles, but “it’s a much tricker process” for so-called soft skills.\nThat suggests non-technical careers may benefit proportionally more from the credential of a college degree. But Brenner says more and more companies are making exceptions even for those roles, as long as you’ve found other ways to show how effective you can be.\n“If you have a good track record,” says Brenner, “it’s more about your outputs and what you could produce versus where you went to school.”\nThe smooth on-ramp: contract work and DAOs\nUndergraduate programs teaching blockchain and crypto skills have only really appeared within the last few years. That means crypto still offers a lot of non-traditional pathways for those looking to enter the industry, and they’ve recently become easier to access because of the rise of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.\nDAOs are almost by their nature great places to explore a career in crypto, learn basic skills and build a track record. They often rely on short-term contracts, with workers assigned specific tasks for the DAO. That might include anything from writing text for a website to debugging contract code. Getting those gigs requires, above all, identifying projects you’re interested in and finding out where members gather and communicate (often, on an easily accessed Discord chat server).\nGetting this sort of gig work is often a lot easier than getting hired for a full-time job because neither side is making a huge commitment. They can also be a perfect fit for students still learning the ropes while mostly focused on classes.\nBut once team members get to know you, DAO contributions can lead to a more formal role – including non-technical roles. In fact, as I was writing this piece, a small data point popped up on Twitter.\nAccording to Zeugh, aka Ion Neto, he had been doing community management for JuiceboxDAO for about a year when the opportunity to take on a full-time role at another DAO came his way.\nHow a downturn can be good for freelancers\nThough there are still happy stories like Zeugh’s, DAO contract opportunities have certainly been hurt by the economic and crypto-market downturn. DAOs are an exciting new frontier in the expanding blockchain universe, and largely rely on investor funds to operate. Those haven’t entirely dried up but they’ve definitely gotten scarcer.\n“Many DAOs have entered into budget-reducing modes of various kinds,” says Spencer Graham. Graham is a core contributor at DAOHaus, a platform for community-driven DAOs. “Some DAOs have done the equivalent of laying off contributors, others have shifted to a constrained project-based budgeting approach, and most have decided to reduce per-contributor compensation as well.”\nBut there are upsides to the downturn, perhaps most importantly for those early in their careers or still in school.\n“When companies are not hiring permanent workers, there is typically an increase in freelance opportunities,” says Hired’s Josh Brenner, “because those companies want to achieve the same work but need more flexibility in how they staff it.” This includes mainstream tech companies, and could mean that workers with less experience have more opportunities to add to their resumes.\nThe wintery downturn also offers some advantages for building a career in crypto specifically. With fewer Super Bowl commercials and Paris Hilton plugs, a lot of people briefly attracted to the surface hype tend to suddenly disappear from crypto. This can mean more opportunities for people attracted instead to the deeper goals and ideals of the crypto industry – things like financial inclusion and displacing surveillance capitalism.\nThose deeper commitments are also a huge leg up for long-term and fulfilling success in the industry. In fact, looking inward and deciding precisely why you’re pursuing a crypto career may be the most important framework for planning ahead.\n“The people who get into crypto are true believers,” says Blind’s Chen. “They have this kind of mental reward of working on building something new. And that’s a key motivator that might not exist if you worked at Goldman.”\nLayer 2\nEducation Week",

    "content": "Released this week, the Best Universities for Blockchain 2022 by CoinDesk serves as a global resource for those looking to study this important technology. Four primary categories were investigated to determine the best universities for blockchain across the globe: (1) an institution’s strength in research and academic contributions to advancing the field; (2) the existing blockchain offerings on campus, whether in the form of classes, educational centers, clubs, etc.; (3) employment and industry outcomes; and (4) overall academic reputation. Every university received an individual score in each category. These scores were then normalized and added together to determine the overall score for the university and its rank.\nThe 50 schools we ranked came from just four regions: Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific Islands. Asia and the Pacific Islands dominated the list with 20 schools. A closer examination of the schools by region showed clear strengths among each of the four metrics.\nThe best universities for blockchain in Asia and the Pacific Islands\nUniversities in Asia and the Pacific Islands had the highest average overall score of 63.7, as well as the highest average research output score for regions with more than one school on the list. Asia and the Pacific Islands cemented its place as the top region for blockchain education with the sheer volume of research it is producing in the blockchain space. Sixty percent of the top 10 research producers are located in Asia and the Pacific Islands.\nThe best universities for blockchain in North America\nNorth America has 16 universities in our final 50 and they also achieved the second-highest average overall score of 57. North American schools scored the highest in campus blockchain offerings. While North American schools may be lagging behind their Asian and Pacific Island counterparts in blockchain research production, they tended to offer a greater variety of blockchain classes, have more research centers on campus and more student clubs dedicated to blockchain technology – all of which are counted in the campus blockchain offerings score. Graduates from North American universities also tended to have improved employment outcomes, yet another metric we measured, compared to other regions.\nThe best universities for Blockchain in Europe\nAlthough Europe did not come out on top in any category by region that was investigated, the 13 European schools that made our final ranking scored second-highest in reputation and employment outcomes. Survey respondents viewed European universities as more prestigious than their Asian, Pacific Island or Middle Eastern counterparts.\nThe best universities for blockchain in the Middle East\nThis year only one university in the Middle East made the Top Universities for Blockchain in 2022. King Saud University stood out from all but one U.S. school – Cornell University – for its number of blockchain research published papers and citations. The university has been investigating how blockchain technology can improve supply chains and energy grids.\nLayer 2\nEducation Week",

    "content": "CORRECTION (July 11, 07:30 UTC): Corrects number of inscriptions in the headline and text to 350K daily from 3.5M total.\nActivity in Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs, a method of generating Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing, has picked up in the wake of the BRC-69 token standard launch.\nThe number of new inscriptions rose to over 350,000 on Monday, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\nThe daily tally has surged by over 250% since Ordinals launchpad Luminex unveiled the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC)-69 token standard on July 3. The modified version of the BRC-20 standard was launched to reduce the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.\n\"With BRC69, we can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90%. This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets,\" Luminex said in a Tweet thread.\n\"The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity. Minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions,\" Luminex added.\nSo far, BTC-69 seems to have delivered on its promise.\nWhile the number of new inscriptions has surged, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics.\nOrdinals went live in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network.\nPer Glassnode, the Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, with the first representing activity between early February and late April. The image-based inscriptions led the first wave, while high free-paying text-based inscriptions led the second wave, which began in May.\n\"By inscription count, Wave 2 was an order of magnitude larger, however activity has been in consistent decline since May. There has been a brief uptick in text inscriptions this week, however unconfirmed transactions across Bitcoin mempools are starting to clear overall,\" Glassnode's weekly report published Monday said.",

    "title": "Ethereum Briefly Stopped Finalizing Transactions. What Happened?",
    "summary": "The loss in finality meant that blocks could have been tampered with, and while it isn’t supposed to affect end-user experiences, it did lead to some inconveniences for some applications.",
    "content": "The Ethereum blockchain suffered two brief episodes last week where blocks weren’t finalizing – an unwanted bout of instability that presents risks to the blockchain’s security but isn’t considered dire.\nThere was a lot of confusion in terms of what the delay in “finality” meant for the functionality of the blockchain, prompting discussions about security concerns. So, it bears unpacking a bit.\nYou’re reading The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\nThe cause of the temporary loss of block finality remains under investigation, though Prysm, a provider of client software used to run a node on the blockchain, just released a new version, describing it as “the first full release following the recent mainnet issues,” with “critical fixes.”\nWhen data blocks don’t finalize, there isn’t supposed to be any downtime or difference in end-user experience. That said, a loss in finality can lead to some security issues like reorgs.\nReorgs occur when a blockchain produces more than one block at the same time, usually because of a bug or an attack. This means that a validator node temporarily creates a new version of a blockchain, which makes it difficult to properly verify if a transaction has been successful, while the old version of the blockchain continues to exist.\nHowever, snowball effects from this incident led to some end-user jolts. DYdX, a leading crypto exchange platform, had to temporarily pause deposits because of one of last week’s incidents, and Polygon’s zkEVM also experienced some delays with deposits.\nSo how does finalization work?\nIn a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum’s, validators first have to propose a block that contains transactions. Once those are proposed, other validators have to sign off on the block to permanently add it to the blockchain, which takes about 15 minutes. Once it is approved, or “attested,” by two-thirds of validators, the block eventually becomes finalized.\nThus, finality is the point where transactions on a blockchain are considered immutable. Finality is supposed to guarantee that transactions within a block cannot be altered.\nIf finality cannot be guaranteed, the blockchain enters an emergency state called the \"inactivity leak,\" where validators receive penalties for not reaching finalization. When the state is triggered, it acts as a way to incentive the blockchain to start finalizing again. The incident last week triggered Ethereum's first-ever inactivity leak.\nThe Ethereum community has acknowledged that the current timeframe for blocks to be finalized is too long.\n“Having a delay between a block's proposal and finalization also creates an opportunity for short reorgs that an attacker could use to censor certain blocks or extract MEV,” the Ethereum website shared in a blog.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was writing about finality seven years ago, an indication of just how important an issue it is.\nWhen the first loss of finality occurred on May 11, developers immediately shared it over Twitter, saying they were going to deploy extra help to figure out what was going on. After 25 minutes, the issue seemed to have been resolved and the chain resumed finalizing.\nRoughly 24 hours later, the chain stopped finalizing again for about an hour, which caused outages for some infrastructure providers.\nIn the past, finalization has temporarily stopped because of bugs in client software used to run the blockchain. Ethereum has multiple clients in the event that there is a flaw or glitch in the software, so there are other options, and the activity on the blockchain can keep running.\nHow did this affect the applications?\nTim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk the incident is “definitely significant, but it's not something where Ethereum’s security or soundness is at risk or compromised.”\n“Within minutes, things were corrected and within like a day or two clients had software patches to make sure that this specific case did not come up again,” he said.\nThe developers are still looking to understand what caused the blockchain to stop finalizing, and are expected to discuss a post-mortem report in their upcoming Consensus Layer call.\nBeiko told CoinDesk that the incident did not get to a point “where we began to test the very extreme fallbacks in the protocol to deal with this stuff.”\nThe incidents did affect several applications that run on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\nJordi Baylina, technical lead at Polygon, said that the finality stoppage meant that deposits onto the Polygon zkEVM chain were delayed, and since the chain relied on Infura, an infrastructure provider which also temporarily had an outage as a result of the loss in finality, issues for individuals using the zkEVM compounded.\n“You need to wait for the finality in layer 1 deposit to be available in layer 2,” Balyina said. “So until you don't have finality, you cannot use [the chain] or you have the risk of double spending in layer 2.”\nDYdX paused its deposits temporarily today due to the lack of Ethereum finality and said it was “continuing to monitor and investigate this issue.”\nDespite this, Ethereum developers emphasize that the network did not go down.\n“Today’s incident has been a great fire drill. It looks like two or three issues came together (as is often the case). The chain recovered gracefully and we discovered a few other issues that could be improved to make Ethereum more resilient,” tweeted Marius van der Wijden, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation.\nRead more: Ethereum Resumes Finalizing Blocks after Second Performance Hiccup in 24 Hours",

    "title": "What Is a Crypto Foundation?",
    "summary": "These crypto organizations share a not-for-profit status but can have different goals and methods of supporting blockchain projects.",
    "content": "Crypto foundations are non-profit organizations created to support specific blockchains and related projects. They can foster community building and support decentralized control over a project. Though it may seem odd that an entity is responsible for a community-led project, foundations are a common practice in the industry.\nOperating alongside the community and for-profit developers, crypto foundations have offered some significant benefits to blockchain projects, including assistance and assurance that a blockchain remains decentralized in its development. They also can provide marketing and education about the project to boost recognition and adoption.\nWhile there are benefits to crypto foundations, some have recently looked more skeptically at the crypto foundation model and are questioning who the structure benefits. To provide context to crypto foundations, we’ll cover what crypto foundations do and why they exist.\nWhat do crypto foundations do?\nDespite the close relationship between foundations and blockchain ecosystems, foundations do not take an active role in developing or controlling the blockchain. Instead, foundations are primarily responsible for the continued growth and support of a blockchain, its related technology and support for the community.\nThe support offered by crypto foundations can come in the form of non-financial and financial support.\nNon-financial support can include engaging with the community, creating connections for projects and hosting events. The Ethereum Foundation, for example, hosts the Devcon Conference and other Ethereum events for developers and researchers to learn more about Ethereum while connecting with other builders in the community.\nWhile these foundations tend to invest and support ecosystem projects, this is not to be confused with the charity work done by traditional non-profits.\nInstead, foundations are funding projects in a way more similar to the work of a traditional venture capital firm, granting funding to projects that will help the overall ecosystem around that blockchain. The Solana Foundation, for instance, offers investments through the Solana Foundation Grants program to “ initiatives aimed at decentralizing, growing, and securing the Solana network.” Crypto foundations can also be involved with non-grant funding or investments alongside traditional venture capital firms like a16z or Pantera Capital.\nWhy do crypto foundations exist?\nCrypto foundations are designed to further the decentralization and evolution of a project. By providing support without direct involvement, crypto foundations ensure that the development of a blockchain is distributed across the community and not centralized by one single entity. Despite this ambitious goal, it’s unclear if foundations actually achieve decentralization.\nBlockchains are not created in a void and some degree of centralization needs to occur for a project to launch. At launch, a for-profit entity is almost always the catalyst for the project’s creation. The foundation typically comes sometime after.\nTo illustrate, let’s take a look at Filecoin (FIL) and the Filecoin community. Protocol Labs is a for-profit, research and development lab specifically focused on developing decentralized storage solutions for Filecoin. Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web is a non-profit entity that provides guidance and support to projects looking to build within the Filecoin ecosystem. The same relationship exists among almost every other blockchain, like the Algorand Foundation (non-profit) and Algorand Inc (for-profit).\nDebates around decentralization and crypto foundations arise when discussing the relationship between for-profit entities and non-profit foundations. Foundations are typically kicked off by for-profit entities and receive an allocation of tokens at the launch.\nIn the case of Polkadot (DOT), the Web3 Foundation received around 12% of the initial token supply, or 1.2M DOT. The amount of DOT was worth around $348K at the launch but has since exploded to over $7.5M today. This method of funding through token launches is not unique to Polkadot and happens with many other crypto foundations today.\nThe close relationship between foundations and for-profit entities has drawn skepticism beyond just crypto critics, but also the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and class action attorneys. In July 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against both the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs alleging that the two entities violated the Securities Act by selling SOL tokens.\nThe lawsuit, and other similar actions taken against foundations, highlight another added benefit of having a crypto foundation: dodging securities liability.\nFor the purposes of evaluating whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security under US law, courts typically turn to the Howie Test. Under this test, the court will determine that a cryptocurrency is a security when it is:\nIf a cryptocurrency satisfies each of these four prongs in the Howey Test, then it may be considered to be a security under U.S. law. While the first three prongs may be true for nearly every cryptocurrency, the final prong of the test is what crypto foundations help to circumvent, though other ways such as DAOs (which may or may not be part of a foundation) or engaging proof-of-stake as the consensus mechanism are also used as proof of decentralization.\nFoundations are responsible for the development and support of a blockchain but do so in passive or parallel ways. This decentralized approach to blockchain development has provided a pseudo-safe haven for developers to continue building without a token becoming a security. As long as there isn’t a centralized nature to the development, many believe that the blockchain’s underlying cryptocurrency cannot be considered a security.\nFoundations serve as one key point in the argument that cryptocurrencies are exempt from securities law. To add an additional layer of protection from U.S.-based enforcement, these foundations are additionally created in Switzerland or other crypto-friendly countries.\nNonetheless, the only asset that the SEC has officially deemed to not be a security is Bitcoin, and ongoing debates in the U.S. over whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities are complex and time will tell if a blockchain having an associated foundation will factor in future decisions and regulations.",

This growth underscores the profound impact that artificial intelligence (“AI”) and related technologies (i.e. large language models, machine learning, and natural language processing) have already had on society. But like any promising new technology, AI also has the potential to harm. Could blockchain help meet some of these challenges? Here are three key areas where blockchain and artificial intelligence intersect:\nSource: World of Statistics\nProgress: The Intersection of Crypto and AI Today\nWhile the convergence of crypto and AI is in its infancy, it has already garnered significant investor interest. So far in 2023, venture capitalists have invested $422 million specifically in crypto applications related to AI, privacy and identity. Notable raises include Worldcoin, a verification and identity-based protocol that raised $115 million in a Series C round, and Auradine, an AI and privacy-focused web3 infrastructure solution that secured $81 million in Series A funding.\nCo-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Worldcoin’s blockchain-based \"proof of humanity\" system uses retinal scans to authenticate human users. The company's long-term vision is to combat the increasing presence of bots online and mitigate potential AI-related wealth inequality. So far, it has attracted 1.8 million sign-ups from dozens of countries.\nConclusion\nDriven by technologies like ChatGPT, AI is influencing society at a mass scale. Since ChatGPT reached the landmark of 100 million sign-ups in January 2023, $5.4 billion has been invested in AI startups worldwide which may lead to additional advancements in the technology.\nAs AI systems develop, the accompanying challenges and solutions will also evolve, increasing the intersection and synergies between crypto and AI.

    "content": "In the face of mounting urgency to address climate change, the quest for innovative solutions to foster sustainable growth and resilience is more critical than ever. Coming from the realm of digital currencies, blockchain technology emerges as a trailblazing force, poised to drive a transformative shift within the green economy and catalyze climate-friendly investment and innovation across a multitude of sectors.\nAt its essence, blockchain operates as a decentralized digital ledger, meticulously recording transactions with unparalleled security and transparency across a vast network of computers. This revolutionary technology harbors the potential to redefine how governments, private companies, multinational corporations and communities adapt to and mitigate the multifaceted risks posed by climate change.\nOsho Jha is the CEO and co-founder at dClimate, a decentralized network for climate data.\nThough blockchain is a groundbreaking and invaluable tool, it represents just one element within a complex, interconnected web of solutions. Tackling climate change necessitates a unified, concerted effort from governments, businesses and individuals, each harnessing the power of diverse innovations, robust information-sharing networks and sustainable infrastructure.\nBlockchain technology holds particular promise in the fight against climate change for three key reasons: it can amplify voluntary carbon markets to channel billions of dollars towards green investments, facilitate the widespread adoption of parametric insurance for climate events and accelerate development of open data infrastructure necessary to help coordinate global actors.\nBy unlocking the immense potential of blockchain, we stand at the precipice of a transformative era in the global movement towards a greener economy.\nOpen data infrastructure\nA major challenge in addressing climate change is the lack of access to high-quality, reliable data. Accurate climate information is crucial for decision-makers – ranging from policymakers to investors – to make informed choices that promote sustainability. Blockchain technology can serve as the foundation for an open data infrastructure, enabling secure and transparent sharing of climate data.\nSeveral decentralized climate information ecosystems have emerged to leverage blockchain technology, providing trusted, transparent platforms for sharing and monetizing climate data. By using smart contracts and token incentives, data providers can be rewarded fairly for their contributions while ensuring data integrity and accessibility.\nAn open data infrastructure would allow businesses to access reliable climate data, helping them identify new climate-friendly investment opportunities and assess risks associated with climate change.\nCorporations and institutions can leverage this open data infrastructure for transparent and accurate climate risk assessment and disclosure. Further, as regulatory bodies and investors demand better climate-related reporting and disclosures, companies can utilize blockchain-based platforms to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and responsible risk management.\nBy providing a secure, transparent and accessible data ecosystem, blockchain technology can help bridge the information gap that has long hampered climate action, empowering businesses to effectively navigate the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world.\nScaling the voluntary carbon market\nThe voluntary carbon market (VCM) has emerged as a critical mechanism for funding carbon reduction and removal projects. However, the current marketplaces have limitations including opaque pricing and verification processes, which has hindered the growth and potential impact of the overall industry. Blockchain technology can streamline and scale the carbon credit market by increasing transparency and efficiency, making it more attractive to businesses and investors.\nBlockchain-powered platforms automate the tracking and management of carbon credits, reducing the risk of double counting and ensuring that credits are verifiable and unique. This increased transparency can lead to more accurate pricing and facilitate the flow of capital to projects with the highest impact, creating more climate-friendly investment opportunities.\nBlockchain technology can also make buying and trading carbon offsets quicker and more transparent, eliminating the need for brokers and intermediaries. Moreover, smart contracts can directly connect buyers and sellers, reducing transaction costs and increasing market efficiency.\nTokenized carbon credits also facilitate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems essential to keeping markets fair. Also, these tokens can be updated automatically when changes occur, ensuring their value accurately reflects the underlying carbon offset project's performance – which has proven challenging for the industry.\nThis level of transparency and automation is crucial for building trust among corporations and institutions in the carbon offset market as a viable tool for achieving sustainable investment goals. By leveraging blockchain technology, the voluntary carbon market can become a more efficient and reliable market, empowering businesses to take meaningful action against climate change and integrate carbon offsets into their broader ESG strategies.\nParametric insurance\nThe increased frequency and severity of climate-related events, such as floods and hurricanes, have exposed the limitations of traditional insurance models. Parametric insurance, which relies on predefined triggers based on measurable parameters to offer pre-specified payouts, are nontraditional but perhaps more efficient, transparent and scalable than other forms of insurance. Blockchain technology can play a pivotal role in the adoption and expansion of parametric insurance, benefiting both insurers and policyholders.\nSimilar to the case mentioned above, blockchain-based platforms can automate the processing and payment of parametric insurance claims using smart contracts, reducing the need for lengthy claims assessments and providing faster payouts to policyholders. By offering a transparent and secure system for managing and verifying data, blockchain technology enables the development of more accurate risk models and pricing, thereby promoting the widespread adoption of parametric insurance.\nDecentralized oracle networks such as Chainlink play a vital role in this process by providing tamper-proof data streams to smart contracts, ensuring the agreed upon triggers for payouts used in parametric insurance are based on accurate and trustworthy information.\nWith access to accurate, real-time data, businesses can better understand their exposure to climate risks across their operations, balance sheets and supply chains. This may prove essential for corporations making informed decisions about their risk management strategies and climate plans.\nParametric insurance, built on a foundation of reliable real-world data secured by a decentralized oracle network, would therefore serve as a valuable tool for building financial resilience and mitigating the negative impacts of climate-related events. As a result, companies would be better placed to survive and thrive in an increasingly uncertain climate landscape.\nBeyond blockchain\nBlockchain technology holds immense potential to drive sustainable growth and innovation across various industries amid an increasingly warming planet. By providing a foundation for an open data infrastructure, streamlining the voluntary carbon market and supporting the expansion of parametric insurance, blockchain can be a transformative force in the transition to a green economy.\nRead more: The Real Benefits of Blockchain Are Here. They're Being Ignored / Opinion\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that blockchain is just one of many tools needed to accelerate climate action. Robust information sharing networks, green infrastructure and collaboration among stakeholders are also crucial for creating lasting change.\nEmbracing blockchain technology, along with a multitude of other innovative solutions, is vital in the search for effective ways to address the pressing issue of climate change. By harnessing the power of these technologies, we can foster a more sustainable, resilient and prosperous future for all.\nBusinesses that leverage the potential of blockchain technology, as well as other cutting-edge solutions, will stand at the forefront of a new era of sustainable growth.",

Joffredo sees Web3 as the next evolution of this mission, with the added benefit of connecting with new audiences.\n“As the brand continues to evolve, it is important to advocate for this same representation in Web3,” said Joffredo. “Additionally, we understood the untapped territory within beauty in the metaverse.”\nIn early 2023, NYX launched GORJS, the world’s first beauty-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to spotlight creators building beauty experiences within the Web3 ecosystem.\n“GORJS integrates Web3 artists and beauty enthusiasts to lead the cultural conversation around what digital makeup artistry will be in the metaverse and beyond,” Joffredo said.\nIt fosters meaningful opportunities for self-expression\nJoffredo also said that transparency and self-expression in the metaverse is a natural extension of NYX Professional Makeup’s brand values, adding that digital spaces give beauty enthusiasts unique avenues to express themselves and interact with products.\nMore poignantly, digital spaces can also provide physical safety amid a politically polarized physical world. Last year, NYX partnered with inclusive avatar company People Of Crypto (POC) and The Sandbox, a user-generated virtual environment, to launch a week-long Pride Month celebration. The event featured gender non-conforming NFT avatars donning makeup styled in a pixelated, or rather “voxelized,” fashion using colors representing the Progress Pride flag.\nIn a recent panel at the extended reality (XR) industry conference, AWE Live, NYX vice president of digital innovation and e-commerce Maya Kosovalic spoke to how the Pride event foreshadowed a more immersive digital future: “Self-expression is really the core tenant of future gaming platform experiences, which are no longer singular, solitary game loops but very immersive, engaging social experiences where younger generations can engage with their in-real-life friends.”\nCelebrating one’s personality and identity through skins and digital goods, she added, is what makes Web3 so interesting for both beauty and fashion brands.\nAlso on the panel was Agustina Sartori, senior innovation director at the American beauty store chain Ulta Beauty. “Beauty is a way to be yourself and be who you want to be,” she said. “Why wouldn't we care about the same thing in the digital world?”\nAccording to Sartori, Ulta Beauty has been experimenting with digital activations on Roblox since 2022. Roblox is a popular user-generated gaming platform that does not utilize blockchain or cryptocurrency but nonetheless appeals to major brands interested in building virtual worlds for customers. Ulta’s virtual Roblox world is called the “Ultaverse.” In May, Ulta Beauty partnered with the cruelty-free eyeshadow brand Urban Decay to throw a virtual party inside the Ultaverse. Makeup influencers Emmy Combs, Leilani Green and Manny MUA hosted the event, which attracted some 500,000 visitors to the platform, said Sartori.\nUlta Beauty was also one of the first beauty brands to announce its participation in the upcoming Metaverse Beauty Week, which will take place from June 12 to 16 in three different metaverse environments (Decentraland, Roblox and Spatial). Interested participants can learn how to set up the necessary crypto wallets and create their first avatar by reading instructions on the event website.\nIt could solve trust issues\nLast, blockchain offers potential solutions for one of the most consistent challenges faced by the beauty industry: greenwashing. Amid growing market pressure to be cruelty-free, eco-friendly and natural, clean beauty brands have been on the receiving end of increased scrutiny in recent years.\nIt’s almost impossible for consumers to track their favorite brands’ ingredients sourcing. But now, there are many supply chain-related use cases for blockchain — most of them still new. The blockchain-based platform created by French luxury skincare company Clarins allows customers to trace their products’ manufacturing journeys on chain. By scanning a QR code on each package, people can trace ingredients’ origins and learn about how the product was made and even packaged.\nAnother way blockchain can help boost trust issues is by weeding out counterfeit products, which is a growing issue in the world of “superfakes.” Luxury fashion giant LMVH launched a blockchain to help prove the authenticity of Louis Vuitton bags and Parfums Christian Dior.\nUnrelated to supply chains, other beauty brand blockchain experiments include experimental bitcoin “cash-back” programs that incentivize consumers by rewarding them with satoshis for each purchase.\nBlockchain-based beauty is exciting, but still experimental\nAs we see in all facets of Web3, the beauty industry is still experimenting with how to most seamlessly use new technology to create lasting impact among its existing and emerging customer base.\n“This is a process and it will take time,” said Leya Kaufman, head of brand, publisher and senior vice president of sales at media company Coveteur. “We will need to cultivate and engage audiences in this new arena while simultaneously maintaining our core consumer base,” she said.\nAlongside leading Web3 infrastructure provider, MoonPay, Coveteur partnered with hair care company Wella Professionals to launch The Wella Generator, a gamified digital sweepstakes hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n“It was important for us to create a program that was seamless for existing and new Web3 users,” Kaufman said, adding that the partnership with MoonPay made this vision possible.\nDespite growing pains, as digital identity becomes an increasingly important factor in our lives and personalities, it makes sense that people want to feel good about how they look and shop, both on-chain and off, and it looks like blockchain is very on-trend for beauty brands in the future.\nSee Also: How Crypto Influencers Are Following the Beauty Playbook",

    "content": "The number of stablecoins, or dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, held in addresses tied to centralized exchanges extended its decline to reach the lowest since May 2021 in a sign of increasing investor aversion to risk.\nAs of Monday, the balance was 21.06 billion, according to Glassnode data. The blockchain analytics firm tracks exchange balances for BUSD, GUSD, HSUD, DAI, USDP, EURS, SAI, sUSD, USDT and USDC.\nThe tally has more than halved since reaching a record high of over 44 billion in mid-December. It gathered pace following the U.S. regulatory crackdown on Paxos' BUSD in February and the subsequent USDC volatility in March.\n\"It's a reflection of risk aversion towards stablecoins following Paxos being told by regulators to stop issuing BUSD and the recent de-pegging of USDC,\" said Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies. \"There has also been a steady decline in the market cap of BUSD and USDC.\"\nPaxos stopped minting the centralized dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD in February, complying with the regulatory order from New York. USDC, the world's second-largest stablecoin, experienced price volatility in March after issuer Circle revealed it held cash balances at the-then crisis-stricken Silicon Valley Bank.\nTether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market value, has become more dominant amid the decline in the exchange balance, while BUSD and USDC have lost ground.\nLack of new money inflows\nInvestors have increasingly preferred stablecoins to fund crypto purchases over the past three years because they help bypass price volatility associated with other tokens.\nA dwindling stablecoin balance coinciding with a bitcoin price rise suggests the rotation of money out of stablecoins and into BTC has been the major driver of the cryptocurrency's 70% rally this year. The market has yet to see new money inflows.\nInvestors parked money in stablecoins last year as the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike cycle aimed at controlling inflation boosted the appeal of the U.S. dollar (USD) and equivalents. However, the motivation to hold USD has weakened since late last year amid hopes for renewed liquidity easing.\n\"Activity-wise, stablecoin balances on CeFi [centralized] exchanges continue to dwindle with little new incremental capital entering the ecosystem,\" SignalPlus, a tech firm focused on democratizing crypto options, said in a daily market report.\n\"Furthermore, user activity on DeFi/[non-fungible tokens]/GameFi remains heavily depressed despite the recovery in spot prices, reinforcing our cautious view on crypto prices in the near future,\" SignalPlus said.",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin network is getting more active with increasing block sizes, transactions, and overall UTXO counts.",
    "content": "Activity on the Bitcoin network is hitting an all-time high because the market has been very receptive to the new collections minted via Ordinals, a type of non-fungible token (NFT) stored on Bitcoin.\nThere’s another metric that’s important, too: unspent transaction output (UTXO). And the UTXO count of bitcoin (BTC) is ticking upwards, set to challenge its all-time high of 84.6 million from November 2022 – when there was a flurry of on-chain activity as traders tried to escape the wreckage of FTX's collapse.\nUTXO refers to the individual units of bitcoin, called satoshis, or sats, that are locked in transactions on the blockchain.\nWhen a transaction occurs, bitcoins are sent from one address to another and the remaining amount is sent back to the sender in the form of a UTXO.\nThese UTXOs can then be used as inputs for future transactions, essentially proving that the sender has the necessary funds to make the payment.\nNow, this spike in UTXO could be explained by an increase in small, retail, interactions with bitcoin. It also shows that more individuals – as opposed to whales or large investors – are currently active on chain.\n\"It seems like the overall trading size of the bitcoins has decreased and investors are carefully watching how the market direction would turn out with the UTXO value bands with less than 0.01 BTC are the main reason for the significant increase in the UTXO counts,“ CryptoQuant contributing analyst Dan Lim wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “It's good progress as there are market participants tapping into the market.\"\nUTXOs have steadily appreciated over the last two years. They experienced a brief dip during the coldest depths of the 2022 FTX-induced, end-of-year crypto winter but resumed their climb as bitcoin rallied through January.\nUTXOs also tells us that despite a new, large cohort of people interacting with bitcoin thanks to Ordinals, there’s also a large group of whales HODLing. As CoinDesk previously reported, the age of UTXOs older than five years has increased by 17% in the past six months.\n“Overall, the growth of the Bitcoin UTXO counts is a good thing because more exposure of bitcoins can create mass adoption in the long run,\" Lim said.\nBut the question is, what does this mean for the price of bitcoin? On one hand, a collision between a large group of stalwart HODLers and a new, growing group of retail users is, in, theory, bullish for the price of bitcoin. Others, however, aren’t so sure.\nTony Ling, co-founder of data portal NFTGo, and a partner at Bizantine Capital doesn’t think the demand from Ordinals is high enough yet to drive up the price of bitcoin even though its causing an up-tick in activity on-chain.\n“There’s no mature marketplace on the Bitcoin network, so I have doubts about the real conversion and purchase demand,” he told CoinDesk in a note.\nAccording to Ling, bitcoin's recent price rise has been fueled by an influx of USDT into bitcoin, not by increased pressure on the Bitcoin network due to ordinals.\nLing is still bullish about the price of bitcoin and expects it to reach around $30,000-$35,000 – but any attempt at testing all-time highs is not going to be until the second half of 2024.",

    "summary": "A trio of sustainability consultants designed a layer 1 blockchain that mints ecological assets and measures the true environmental costs of manufacturing and other commercial enterprises. That’s why Regen Network is one of CoinDesk’s Projects to Watch 2023.",
    "content": "The problem\nFiat currency derives its value from the laws of supply and demand, assigning economic value to goods and services. (Most) cryptocurrencies largely follow the same logic. What these models are not particularly good at doing is encompassing other types of value; social, environmental and ethical. Perhaps that’s why the unintended consequences of transactions are known as “externalities,” as if the effects on air and water quality, for instance, of a company’s work has zero impact on the company’s costs down the line or the people running the operation.\n“Everything that you buy has a certain financial price, but none of the planetary, none of the ecological impact is calculated into that,” said Christian Shearer, co-founder and chief investment officer of Regen Network.\nOn top of that, the complexity of modern economies makes it very difficult to assess the impact of any transaction. How can any individual track the environmental or social implications of a good with components from 43 countries in six continents, made out of materials sourced from several other places? (That’s your iPhone, by the way.)\nFor natural assets this complexity is often solved by centralized entities. Carbon credits, which try to create market incentives for positive steps in the capture or avoidance of greenhouse gasses depend on intermediaries, are traded on what is known as voluntary carbon marketplaces, which in turn become referees for evaluation and verification. This often means a lack of transparency, which has led to serious criticism of their efficacy, and rebuttals from the marketplaces.\nUnderlying the pursuit of this transparency is the belief a measurable impact can eventually be mitigated. So the question is, how do we measure the true cost of our economic activity?\nRead profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto\nThe idea: Regen Network\nBack in 2017, Gregory Landua, Christian Shearer and Brecht Deriemaeker were sustainability consultants who saw crypto as a possible solution to the lack of transparency in transactions that hampered environmental accountability.\nThe three men worked together at Terra Genesis International, which Landua founded and then led. The consultancy continues today to work with companies looking to improve the sustainability of their supply chains or products but also works in broader regenerative agriculture projects. Previous work includes sourcing rubber for Timberland, Vans, and the North Face.\nIn this consulting work, the three men felt “that there was a real lack of digital infrastructure to be able to account for ecological health,” Landua said. A lot of the time, the regenerative projects they were working on would be composed of stakeholders “who all broadly agreed that they wanted something to happen,” such as carbon neutrality, soil health or biodiversity, he said.\nThe process used to generate trust about such ecological impacts was “archaic,” “opaque” and “rife with perverse incentives,” he said. This meant that “even when you have all of these stakeholders who have really good intentions, our observation was the majority of the time projects and outcomes failed to be met,” Landua said.\nAmid the initial coin offering craze of 2017, new ideas around money and its role in societal systems were becoming mainstream, said Landua. The blockchain ledger, with its key attributes of transparency and immutability, seemed like the right technology to try to tackle some of the foundational issues around ecological assets. It could dissolve some of the opacity of carbon markets and be used to build consensus around ecological outcomes. Landua, Shearer and Deriemaeker decided to start Regen Network to bring the power of the blockchain to environmental accountability.\nHow it works\nThe technology the three founders and their team have built is essentially a tailor-made blockchain to mint ecological assets. What is more, the methodologies of capturing data and distributing value related to these assets are also stored on the blockchain for everyone to see. Once digitized and on the blockchain, buyers of ecological assets will be able to choose the ones that fit their needs, as well as audit the methodology behind their claims and therefore their efficacy.\nRegen Network is a layer 1 blockchain, meaning it is the underlying technology that makes up the network. It defines the consensus mechanism used to record transactions on the ledger, who can participate in it as well as other fundamental components.\nThe blockchain is developed on the Tendermint consensus architecture, which also underlies the Cosmos blockchain. This architecture describes a public blockchain, meaning that it is open to participation, using proof-of-stake consensus. It is agnostic to the programming language used.\nOne of Cosmos’ key advantages is that it can be used to build application-specific blockchains, just like Regen Network. By contrast, on the Ethereum network, specific applications are built as layer 2 applications, while the processing of transactions and consensus happens in layer 1.\nRegen’s digital ledger is built to house three types of protocols crucial to ecological accounting, according to its white paper.\nInitially, Regen will “steward” the creation of these protocols, bringing together developers and scientists.” First, they are working on carbon sequestration. The Regen Marketplace, where ecological assets are traded, launched in October, and so far has only included carbon credit projects. More types of protocols are proposed in the white paper, involving grassland health, regenerative agriculture and blue carbon, such that more climate-positive behavior is incentivized.\nThe different types of protocols will also take into account methodologies for measuring environmental attributes and outcomes, such that buyers of the assets can discern exactly what they are getting themselves into.\nGovernance\nThe governance of a blockchain ecosystem is vital to its mission. Without proper governance it is likely to fall into the same pitfalls of the intermediaries it is working against – centralization, opacity and ineffectiveness.\nRegen Network is, like other projects, initially governed by a centralized entity, chosen by the founders. A for-profit entity manages the token issuance and sale of its native crypto, REGEN. The founders have set up a nonprofit organization, the Regen Foundation, to be an independent guardian of the network. The Regen Consortium manages the foundation, which is open even to non-token holders.\nThe Regen Foundation is based in the U.S. The point of the foundation is not to raise money, but to “give power to network participants, like indigenous people, rights-of-nature organizations, scientists and activist groups, who actually need to be part of generating the trust system,” said Landua.\nThe foundation’s members were initially appointed and now rotate, with the consortium’s vote.\nCurrently, the consortium members, who are mostly in regenerative agriculture, are looking for more crypto-native organizations to join, said Szal. The consortium governs 5 million of Regen’s token, which “enables us to maintain at least 35% voting power in locked governance DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations]” to “optimize for community engagement in the governance of the blockchain,” according to the white paper.\nHaving non-token holders participate in the governance process is an unusual call for crypto. It “is clear that the distinct communities of users who may be unable to purchase tokens” should also have a seat at the table, said the white paper.\nThe governance system may not be perfect, but the team did its best to “create appropriate decentralization and checks and balances among a set of actors, and not just have it be like, ‘Oh, these VCs [venture capitalists] own all of this’,” said Landua.\nThe crypto conundrum\nRealizing this vision is something of a Catch-22. The whole idea is to build a novel system of value, beyond economic incentives. In order to do that, Regen Network needs to work within the current system – which, by definition, doesn't align with its goals.\nVCs usually look upon the size of the market, the speed of the return on their investment and the possible risks. A project that is literally trying to redefine economic value away from money likely doesn’t score well in most of these categories.\n“We're not selling an easy hype story, we're selling a story around creating public open infrastructure, that should by its nature, not [be] extracting as much value from participants as possible,” said Landua.\nFor investors whose “primary goal is just to extract as much money out of a system as possible, Regen Network is decidedly not the right thing [...], because the whole premise is that that is not the way to build these public goods markets,” he said.\nShearer explained why it’s “frustrating” to bring investors on board: Especially in the blockchain space, often people are asking, “Why are you building this green thing? It just seems like some sort of charity effort. That doesn't sound like it's gonna make me much money. [...] Maybe I'll give it a donation sometime.”\nBut to him, “ecological assets have to become an incredibly important asset class in this century. Because if they don't, we're all doomed,” he says. “Carbon is already stepping up and showing that it's becoming an important asset class. Biodiversity is gonna be right on its heels – water quality, these types of things.”\nIf Regen’s bet pays off, which will likely require a good amount of government policy, natural capital and ecological assets will be “a multi-trillion dollar industry that's being born before our eyes,” says Landua. So even “a small responsible percentage of that is “a crazy amount of capital.”",

    "content": "When trying to connect the dots between who’s up and who’s down in crypto – plus who’s in and who’s out, who’s getting along and who’s feuding – sometimes it’s helpful to simply pay attention to who’s getting conference invitations. Or disinvitations.\nThe latest example of this conference-watching dynamic went public this week as blockchain developers convened in Colorado ahead of ETHDenver, one of the year’s biggest events on the crypto circuit.\nThere were invitations, and then disinvitations. The takeaway appears to be that tensions are brewing between the projects Aptos and Sui – two blockchains that emerged, in part, from Facebook’s (now Meta Platforms') defunct Diem stablecoin project.\nOfficials at Pontem, a crypto wallet startup backed by the Aptos blockchain, are hosting the MoveCon conference later this week in the Aptos house, on the sidelines of ETHDenver. The focus of the event is Move, a coding language that Facebook engineers developed for Diem; it's also the base language for Aptos and Sui.\nInitially, the Pontem team had asserted its conference was “dedicated” to both corners of the Move ecosystem. Sui representatives were invited.\n\"We’re gathering the biggest projects from Aptos, Sui and the rest of the ecosystem for a three-day blockchain conference, a real celebration of everything Move,\" Pontem officials wrote in a Feb. 14 post about the event.\nBut according to people familiar with the matter – and some tweets – Pontem subsequently disinvited Sui Foundation attendees. One of the people said Aptos officials told Pontem organizers to exclude Sui speakers, although a handful of project founders working in the Sui ecosystem are already confirmed.\nThe disinvitation dis\nA representative for Aptos said the organization had no role in Pontem’s speaker choices, or in organizing the conference. Pontem founder Alejo Pinto declined to comment.\n“Sui Foundation will not be attending MoveCon on March 3-5,” Brian Hsieh, head of developer relations, said in a Telegram message shared with CoinDesk. “We have been informed by the host that we are no longer invited.”\nHsieh declined to comment when reached by CoinDesk.\nHe later retweeted a tweet referencing the disinvitation:",

    "title": "Sempo Delivers Cash Aid for the Unbanked in Crisis",
    "summary": "Digital money is becoming the go-to vehicle for serving people recovering from disaster. But when those in need have no smartphones or bank accounts, aid organizations have to distribute cash more creatively. That’s why Sempo is one of CoinDesk’s Projects to Watch 2023.",
    "content": "The problem:\nHumanitarian aid has undergone a radical transformation in the last decade because non-governmental organizations (NGO) have largely reduced their efforts for giving out in-kind donations – such as food, clothing, and medical supplies – in times of crisis. Now, cash is making up an increasingly large portion of all humanitarian aid.\nCash, unlike in-kind donations, lets recipients make their own choices about when and how to care for themselves and their families in emergency situations.\nHowever, distributing cash aid comes with its own challenges. Moving physical cash around can be difficult and dangerous, especially in the aftermath of natural disasters. Other issues – like corruption or currency devaluation – can also be a problem.\nDigital cash transfers can make things easier, but not everyone who needs aid has a bank account – or access to the internet. Crypto has been floated as a potential solution to these issues, but how can crypto serve disaster victims who do not have smartphones, bank accounts, or internet access?\nRead profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto\nThe idea: Sempo\nSempo was started in July 2017 by a pair of young Australians entrepreneurs, Tristan Cole and Nick Williams.\nTheir inspiration was a Web 2 humanitarian aid distribution platform called GiveDirectly, which allows donors to send cash to people living in poverty.\n“What they do is give people money in Africa and other underserved communities,” Cole said. “They raise funds in places like Australia and the United States – all over the world – and they give people money. And for me, I found that very interesting.”\nCole pointed out that 90% of money sent through GiveDirectly goes to beneficiaries.\n“With traditional NGOs, it’s not that at all,” Cole said. Overhead costs and administrative fees for traditional donation methods can eat up as much as 30% of the cash value. “I was, like, why can’t we do this with Oxfam or any of these other NGOs?” Cole said when he and Williams reached out to humanitarian aid organizations, they found that the organizations were struggling with major technological challenges in running their cash transfer programs.\n“There’s no infrastructure in the places we work,” Cole said. “Like, in Vanuatu, the banking infrastructure isn’t great. Most people are unbanked who actually need the assistance. So that’s what really inspired me. I’m very interested in how we can do more financial empowerment for others … there’s still so many people who don’t have access to things that we take for granted.”\nOne such thing is access to the internet, which is a major challenge for many projects Sempo works with. Other crypto-native aid distribution programs, like Stellar Aid Assist, require the internet to function. But blockchain-powered Sempo has an option that doesn’t require the internet to function. Instead of sending crypto between beneficiaries and local merchants, beneficiaries can instead use a tap-to-pay card that doesn’t require an internet connection.\n“The pay card is used by Oxfam as well as others,” Cole said. “It's used in places that maybe have lower levels of digital literacy, lower financial literacy and ultimately, places that don't have great internet infrastructure because it can work offline at times, which is the real key selling point there.”\nOpen-source aid\nThe project went through several accelerators in Australia and the U.S., including dlab, an early-stage crypto accelerator. Between all the programs, Sempo’s founders raised approximately AU$450,000 – a little over US$300,000.\n“It's pretty much been bootstrapped the whole way,” Cole told CoinDesk. “Just Nick and myself funding it, and revenue from customers.” Williams left Sempo in 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nSempo’s core infrastructure was made open source in 2019, which means organizations that want to run projects on Sempo don’t need to pay for the privilege of doing so – something that was important to Cole, who wanted to make the software accessible to organizations helping people in need. There are a number of organizations, including the Red Cross, who use the open-source software for free, said Cole.\nHowever, if organizations aren’t tech savvy enough to set up and run the project on their own using Sempo’s free tutorials, they can use Sempo’s hosted model, paying Cole a software service fee and consulting fees to get their help designing and running the project.\n“It’s much more hand-holding from the start of the program – the ideation phase all the way to monitoring, evaluation and then scaling it up,” Cole said of the hosted model.\nEventually, once a project is set up, it can transition to an unpaid, self-run project, which happened with the Red Cross and another project called Grassroots Economics, Cole said. He said he is currently working with Oxfam to help it transition its hosted project to a self-run project as well.\nCole’s ambition for Sempo is to eventually help all projects transition to a self-hosted model.\n“It’s a part of growing up – you have to learn to let go,” Cole said. “The best transition for [Sempo] was to move to just a fully open-source model because it’s the purpose of working with nonprofits.”",

    "summary": "\"Europeum\" could safeguard values like privacy, Belgian Digital Minister Mathieu Michel told CoinDesk, as he seeks to make his country a blockchain hub.",
    "content": "After regulating cryptocurrencies, European politicians are contemplating the next step in the race to attract Web 3 business – and it might be a tailor-made blockchain that respects privacy, Belgium’s digital minister told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.\nA new “Europeum” blockchain could be the vehicle to record property ownership, driving licenses or professional qualifications while sticking to the European Union’s high regulatory norms, Mathieu Michel said.\nAfter a string of scams and scandals, Michel is in favor of moving away from purely financial applications of distributed technology, into public services and supply-chain management.\nThe EU has already drawn a line in the sand with its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), which sets governance and stability rules for cryptocurrency service providers.\nIf voted on in April, the bloc could become the world’s first major jurisdiction with a clear crypto framework – but the story shouldn’t end there if Europe wants to lead the world in blockchain, said Michel, a member of the French-speaking centrist party MR.\nMiCA “goes in the right direction, but it’s only a first step,” Michel said, saying the bloc should consider “a blockchain network constructed around the foundational values” that underpin European society.\n“Imagine you have Europeum – the blockchain that contains a whole series of conditions for protecting private life and so on, which are very transparent,” he said, conjuring a word that appears a play on the name of the Ethereum network. Instead of the political minefield of cryptocurrency, he said, it could focus on areas that are less sensitive or prone to abuse – like digitizing administrative documents or educational diplomas to be recognized across the bloc.\nRead more: MiCA at the Door: How European Crypto Firms Are Getting Ready for Sweeping Legislation\nFor Michel, high European standards in areas such as data privacy – safeguarded by the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation – are an asset that the bloc can use to carve its own digital niche. Now, he believes, they may need to be reflected in Web 3.\nPrivacy\n“Ethereum is traceable – I find that crazy,” he said of the trait that allows users to see full transaction details for a given wallet, a level of transparency he sees as excessive. “If you go to eat with your mistress at a restaurant, do you want it to appear on the blockchain?”\nMichel, convinced that Web 3 can help companies organize their supply chains and governments offer public services, is on a mission to make his country a hub for Web 3 activity. On Feb. 20 he launched Blockchain for Belgium, to offer advice to policymakers, and provide networking opportunities for entrepreneurs in the sector.\nMichel is frank about the challenges. Europe isn’t as easy a place to raise capital as the U.S., making it less attractive for any kind of startup. The situation is still harder given Belgium’s complex federal structure: key policies don’t lie in Michel’s hands, but in those of regional governments, or the finance minister, Christian Democrat Vincent van Peteghem – people who, Michel says, don’t always share his appreciation or optimism about the technology.\nMichel nonetheless cites a range of blockchain projects – Datavillage, Solid and Settlemint – that chose to make the country their home, and cites a highly skilled workforce as chief among its strengths.\nSkeptics\nIf Michel hopes a community of blockchain enthusiasts can help overcome lawmaker skepticism, it’s clearly not going to be easy.\nIn a March 8 parliamentary debate, held after the interview, lawmaker Michael Freilich said he was “disappointed” with the Blockchain for Belgium initiative, because, rather than acting immediately, the government is seeking recommendations that might only arrive towards the end of its mandate.\n“I was expecting more … the results will once again be nothing,” said Freilich, who is from the right-wing New Flemish Alliance, which is the largest grouping in the Federal Chamber but isn’t one of the seven parties that form the governing coalition.\nHigh among the complaints of the crypto community is the Belgian tax system – which imposes the highest labor levies in the developed world, and leaves the taxation of investment income in an unhelpful legal gray area. Michel suggests he’s been listening; he says he’s working on changes to clarify when and how virtual earnings should be taxed, something he says could help make Belgium “the Switzerland of blockchain.”\nFor blockchain entrepreneurs like Julien Romanetto of the Smurfs Society, a company which produces non-fungible tokens (NFT) of characters from the Belgian cartoon, the support from Michel is welcome – not least because policymakers have such a crucial role to play in determining the ecosystem’s future.\n“Europe has a strong hand to play in blockchain,” Romanetto told CoinDesk. “There needs to be regulation, but it shouldn’t constrain … too much regulation and people will go to Dubai.”\n“It’s great the government is doing something, but just setting up a WhatsApp group won’t be enough,” Romanetto said.\nQuotes have been translated from French.\nRead more: Brussels’ Fledgling Crypto Industry Flexes Its Muscles",

    "summary": "The internet has a habit of producing companies that dominate their industry because of network effects. The answer is the decentralization and openness that only blockchain technology affords, says EY’s Paul Brody.",
    "content": "Lots of critics have a hard time seeing the value proposition of blockchains, and I can’t entirely blame them. As I often have to tell my clients, anything you can do on a blockchain you can do better, faster and cheaper with a centralized system. So why bother at all?\nBlockchains are absurdly complicated systems where everyone is checking everyone else’s work. You thought public key encryption was tedious? Try wrapping your head around zero-knowledge proofs. I have, frankly, given up and just trust the EY R&D staff when they tell me the math works.\nPaul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.\nSo what is the value proposition of a public blockchain? Why go to all that trouble? The answer is decentralization. It’s the only thing you can truly have on a public blockchain that you cannot have in any other system. And we’re not talking very much about why decentralization is immensely important for every single company on Earth and for all our longer-term prosperity. A reasonable guess as to how much decentralization is worth is about $1 trillion a year in the U.S. alone, and it’s growing every day.\nDecentralization has always mattered, but we’ve rarely noticed because it used to just be the way the world worked. We used to have a great deal more decentralization than we do today. As a child, visits to my grandparents in Europe were this amazing world of nearly the same but not quite: Blaupunkt radios, Grundig televisions, Marks & Spencer clothes – all things I did not see in the United States. Even the things that you might expect to be the same were not. Ford Escorts in Europe bore little resemblance to the cars sold in the United States.\nThis decentralization didn’t require any planning and conscious work. It was basically impossible in the old days to run global organizations. Before we had global companies we had multinationals. The names are different because multinationals were companies that operated in many countries, but they were unique firms in different countries. Products looked different around the world because there were no real-time data networks for design collaboration. When a five-minute international phone call cost as much as a dinner for the whole family, it was not practical to have global design or engineering teams. And we didn’t have global software products or data networks either.\nGradually, one bit at a time, that world of local products and variations has disappeared, largely because digital technology enables scale and integration. Over the decades manufacturing scale and digitization have obliterated thousands of smaller brands and companies. This has been a good thing for all of us. In our modern global economy, radios, televisions and clothes are all much cheaper than they used to be.\nBut while scale has consolidated manufacturing and made stuff very inexpensive (and uniform), digitization has brought us a new global age of centralized digital monopolies and cartels, and that’s not a good result.\nThe root cause here is that digital marketplaces are pretty much all natural monopolies, and software and networks are turning just about everything into a digital marketplace.\nTake something simple like a taxi ride. As a child, taxi rides were different everywhere. In London they were an expensive luxury. In Athens, an affordable convenience. In New York, an unavoidable expense, especially if you were going to and from an airport. They were all different and unique. Now, they’re all digital marketplaces for ride sharing. Two companies dominate that business globally.\nRead more: Paul Brody – Policymakers Should Embrace DAOs in the New Future of Abundance\nThe economics of software and networks make this unavoidable. The value of a network, whether it is for instant messaging or ride sharing, gets bigger as you add more users. The more users you have, the more attractive it is for other users to join the network. Over time it becomes increasingly difficult, and eventually nearly impossible, to catch up with the market leader.\nDon’t get me wrong. This process is immensely valuable for business transformation. Early stages of investment to digitize and perfect a marketplace are immensely difficult and create enormous value. Building a real-time system to match drivers and riders in nearly every city, integrated with GPS maps and directions, pricing models, reputation systems and payment systems is a Herculean task. The results are so amazing when you first take one of these rides, it almost feels like magic. You get in, you ride and you get out and walk away.\nThough the early days of digital integration and marketplace development produce enormous value for buyers and sellers, eventually, things start to go wrong. At a certain point these emerging monopolies start to behave less like valuable ecosystem builders and more like extractive monopolists. Prices and fees start to rise and these companies begin an endless cycle of data mining and marketplace exploitation.\nThis isn’t just me whining about the cost of cab fare or the occasional dishonest cabbie. The academic evidence is piling up at both the micro and macro levels. Big retailers that dominate the market are taking ever bigger shares of third-party sales. Ride-sharing companies have raised fees and “take rates” significantly in the last couple of years as the market has consolidated. At the macro level, corporate profits and industry consolidation driven by technology are at the highest levels since the gilded age of monopolies in the 1920s. We’re living in a global golden age of centralized monopolies, many of them facilitated and driven by technology.\nNot all network-enabled technologies produce extractive monopolies. Decentralized networks have a wonderful track record of becoming monopolies without becoming predatory. The internet is a perfect example. TCP/IP, the core technology that underpins all our internet communications, is free, open and permissionless. Internet usage has literally become too cheap to meter in much of the world. Email is another decentralized protocol. There’s no monopoly because there’s no company at the center of these networks obliged to maximize shareholder value.\nHow is it that we can have a global network for nearly instant communications that is astoundingly reliable and for which the cost of usage is nearly too cheap to meter and has been running for decades without interruption, but we need to pay 30% of our cab fare to a software company?\nThe internet as a whole is not radically simpler than ride-sharing. The only real difference is that one is run by a couple of centralized companies and the other is a decentralized and open network. This is not about being against capitalism or free markets, this about being against monopolies and the damage they present to our prosperity.\nTo avoid a world of endless monopolies, we have three choices. We can stop the march of digitization and networks. We can regulate the heck out of all these monopolists. Or we can build decentralized systems that can’t become monopolies.\nThe first choice isn’t a real option. The second choice is a political nightmare. The third choice is called Ethereum. It’s TCP/IP for business value, a pathway to digitization without the risk that you’ll end up a cab company in a ride-sharing world.\nRead more: Paul Brody - Regulators Are Bringing the Multichain Era to a Close\nAnd how does this fit back into the bigger picture about the economy and policy? Because commercial profit-maximizing monopolies create something that economists call “deadweight losses.” That is, profit-maximizing monopolists set the price of a product at a level that maximizes their profit, regardless of what that might have to do with the cost of a product. That price, no surprise, is going to be higher than it would be in a competitive market, and therefore there will be less product consumption.\nNor is this just a matter of transferring wealth from customers to the monopolist. Yes, for sure, the monopolist makes more money, but the economy as a whole is also smaller because there is less production and less consumption overall.\nHow much does this all add up to? Quite a bit. Thomas Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University, estimates that monopolies cost American consumers about $3,600 a year, about 5% of our national output. Across the total U.S. economy that means additional costs of roughly $1 trillion. As the world becomes ever more digitized, that number is only going to get bigger.",

    "summary": "The Lukso initial validators will vote on token supply of LYX and how much the Foundation can hold.",
    "content": "Lukso, a layer 1 blockchain for creative types that was co-founded by blockchain veterans Fabian Vogelsteller and Marjorie Hernandez, is opening a smart contract that lets “Genesis,” or original validators, participate in running the blockchain.\nThe smart-contract deposits will open on the Ethereum blockchain on April 20 (4/20) at 16:20 UTC (or as the team put it, 4:20 p.m. UTC), and will be running for three weeks. According to the team, the choice of time is a reference to \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" book series, television program and movie. Perhaps not entirely coincidentally, it's also a staple of cannabis-culture slang that ranks highly among crypto memes.\nAnyone can become a Genesis validator if they contribute 32 LYXE (about $439 worth) to secure the network. (LYXE is Lukso’s native token, based on the Ethereum blockchain, which will convert to LYX once the Lukso blockchain is live.)\nThe Genesis validators will generate the Genesis files, which will run the new blockchain.\n“So the community basically just runs the network with these Genesis files and starts the Lukso network,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk.\nRead more: Inventor of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token Standard Plans New Blockchain ‘LUKSO’ for Creative Types\nGenesis validators on Lukso will have an important role in establishing the supply of the LYX token, as well as how involved the Foundation (the Foundation for New Creative Economies) will be in the ecosystem. As part of the smart contract deposit, Genesis validators will vote on how many LYX tokens should exist when the network starts. They will vote on whether 35 million LYX will be in circulation with the Foundation holding 11.8% of the token supply, 42 million LYX in circulation with the Foundation holding 26.5% of token supply, or 100 million LYX in circulation, with the Foundation holding 69.1% of token supply.\nLukso’s Genesis deposit smart contract will run as long as it obtains 4,096 validator keys to start safely. Once enough validator keys are created, Lukso will freeze the smart contract, and the Lukso blockchain network will start running.\nLukso is a new layer 1 project aimed at blockchain creatives, and what the project's co-founders call the “creative economy.” The blockchain is centered around “universal profiles,” which gives users the ability to create an on-chain identity to be used in all sorts of places (NFTs, decentralized social media, payments), making activity of users integrated under one roof that is more than just a wallet address.\n“When we started exploring the idea you had a community that was very developer centric,” said Marjorie Hernandez, a co-founder of Lukso. Hernandez said that she is excited to see what others use the blockchain for. “I really look forward to people building implementations of the universal profiles that are superior to ours, and marketplaces and more.”\nThe LXYE price had gained 9.7% over the prior 24 hours at the time CoinDesk broke the news of the timing of the launch, but it has since climbed another 8.8% – one of the day’s best-performing tokens among those with market capitalization of at least $100 million, according to Messari.\nThe token’s price has roughly doubled since CoinDesk wrote of the plans for the launch on April 5.\nCORRECTION (April 20, 2023 16:04 UTC): After publication of this story, Lukso contacted us to correct numbers on token supply and how long the window will be open for those looking to join the smart contract. This story has been updated to include the correct information.\nUPDATE (April 18, 2023 16:26 UTC): Adds information about LYXE price.",

    "content": "An onchain metric suggests that litecoin (LTC), the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market value, is trading at discounted prices.\nLitecoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score was negative at press time. A sub-zero score indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued relative to its fair value, according to analytics firm Glassnode.\nThe market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by litecoin's going market rate. The realized value is a variation of the market cap that adds the market value of coins when they last moved on the blockchain.It excludes all coins lost from circulation (more than 15%) and is said to reflect the real or fair value of the network.\nThe Z-score shows by how many standard deviations the market value differs from the realized value.\nHistorically, Z-scores above eight have signified overvaluation and bull market tops, while negative values have indicated undervaluation and market bottoms.\nThe chart shows the Z-score has been consistently negative since July last year.\nThat's not new. The indicator has consolidated below zero several times in the past, eventually paving the way for meteoric bull runs.\nIf history is a guide, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side. That said, litecoin and the broader crypto market remain vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic developments like liquidity tightening and the state of the global economy.\nAt press time, LTC changed hands at $92, representing a nearly 31% gain for the year. Prices clocked a one-month high of $95 early this week, per CoinDesk data.\nLitecoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving in early August, following which the per-block reward paid to miners will reduce by 50% to 6.25 coins from 12.5 coins.",

    "summary": "Sales of tokenized diamonds surged 300% last weekend, when three banks collapsed and investors scrambled to sell their USDC stablecoins.",
    "content": "The collapse of three prominent U.S. banks over the weekend led to market volatility and a lot of uncertainties as to where investors could stash their cash. Gold, the age-old safe haven, saw a boost in prices by about 5% since last week, and another asset that caught investors' attention was diamond – digitized diamond.\nDiamond Standard, a blockchain company that tokenized and standardized the diamond market to allow investors buy the previously hard-to-invest-in gemstone, said it saw a large spike in its marketplace after the banks started to shut down.\nDegen Chain Racks up Millions in Volumes; Latest in Custodia Bank's Legal Battle Against the Fed\nDuring periods of market uncertainty investors often flee to hard assets, such as cash, commodities and real estate to protect investments from volatility.\n“[Sales] of diamond coins and other products increased substantially since Friday on the back of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank being shut down by regulators, USDC breaking its [dollar] peg and amid fears of contagion spreading to other banks and to digital assets,” said Cormac Kinney, founder and CEO of Diamond Standard.\nThe company gathers physical diamonds together in a \"coin\" of standardized value that's stored in a vault. Each holds eight to nine diamonds. The diamond-embedded tokens are digitized through an Ethereum-based digital coin, bitcarbon, which is tradable on different exchanges.\nTrading volume of the tokenized diamond jumped almost 300% during the weekend as investors scrambled to find a haven, said Kinney. Most of the clients who wanted to buy tokenized diamonds wanted to get out of stablecoins, he said.\nRead more: Circle Scrambles to Right USDC After Signature Bank Failure\nMost of the clients that bought into Diamond Standard’s coins were long-only, meaning they wanted to buy and hold the asset to diversify their portfolios while participating in the upside, Kinney said.\n“Our investors, who very often have gold in their portfolios, sees diamonds as something that is uncorrelated to other assets,” providing them an opportunity for diversification and hedging, he said. Kinney noted that the price of diamonds is still playing catch-up with other precious metals, opening doors for investors to participate in the appreciation.\nMost of the buyers are existing customers, which include individuals, family offices and some smaller hedge funds, Kinney noted. During the chaotic weekend, Diamond Standard Spot Market, a peer-to-peer marketplace with a centralized limit order book, remained open 24/7 and handled a jump in volumes, the company said.\nRead more: Blockchain Startup Aims to Open the $1T Diamond Market to More Investors\nKinney, a software entrepreneur and developer of market heat maps, started Diamond Standard in 2018 with a goal to open up the $1.2 trillion diamond market to a wider group of investors.\nThe firm's patented technology is designed to create a more transparent system allowing investors to track supply chains and subsequent ownership of the world’s ultimate bling more easily and efficiently. The company also standardized the value of diamonds by creating a uniform system through blockchain technology.\nKinney said his company primarily banks with Signature Bank, though it has relationships with other banks. While the weekend’s events had been worrisome at the time, he says the company is still using Signature Bridge Bank – a new interim entity that will be temporarily run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – which has transferred all of the deposits and majority of the assets of former Signature Bank.\n“We are using Signature Bridge Bank. That’s the safest bank in the world right right now,” Kinney said.\nRead more: Banking Crisis Won’t Kill Crypto Banking Despite Short-Term Pain",

    "summary": "The high cost of understanding multiple chain environments means enterprises are likely to stick to what they know, argues Paul Brody, head of blockchain at EY.",
    "content": "As firms add more and more blockchains to their strategic road maps, I grow more and more frustrated. Where, I keep wondering, do firms have the money to properly understand and implement such an enormous array of blockchains in their operations? At EY, it costs us about $500,000 to add a new chain to our Blockchain Analyzer platform and we spend between 10%-20% of that amount each year keeping up to date.\nWhile setting up network nodes may not be too difficult, understanding how networks operate and the mechanics of transfers and payments is another matter. When we add a network, we take a close look at the transaction processing model (how transactions are initiated, recorded, processed and reported); the cryptography that underpins those transactions; and the risks that might be associated with different steps in the process. When it comes to audits, we even identify control points where we can perform verification steps.\nPaul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.\nNor are these networks static entities. Ethereum has two to four hard forks a year and other smart contract-enabled chains evolve at a similar rate. The result: Staying up to date on a large number of different blockchains is costly.\nCost isn’t the only factor, either. Liquidity becomes an issue as well. Polling Automated Market Makers (AMM) for their sample prices by volumes of proposed swaps on different token pairs shows how quickly liquidity drops off once you leave the Ethereum blockchain. Even within public Ethereum, trading is highly concentrated among the top tokens. Tokens without liquidity are much more vulnerable to price manipulation.\nInsufficient liquidity in an inadequately regulated market is one of the main reasons the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). The last year has shown, time and again, that crypto asset prices are often manipulated. So these concerns are unlikely to go away and will increasingly deter firms for interacting with, or transacting upon, less-liquid ecosystems.\nRead more: Paul Brody - Policymakers Should Embrace DAOs in the New Future of Abundance\nAs if it wasn’t complicated enough, just deciding which chains to add is a constantly changing mix. Over the last few years, there has been a constant stream of “Ethereum killer” chains taking up the #2 spot in the ecosystem. A good measure of “who’s on top” is the DeFiLlama scorecard showing Ethereum dominance of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFiLlama tracks nearly 140 different chains. At various times, Binance, Terra, Tron and Celo have been in second place, but none has ever represented more than about 20% of the total DeFi ecosystem value. Usually the second chain by volume is at 10% or less.\nNor is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility a useful factor in de-risking a chain’s adoption. EVM compatibility means that (in theory) applications written for Ethereum’s virtual machine will run on any other chain making that claim. Theory doesn’t always match reality exactly, however. As a result, EVM compatibility may actually increase risk.\nEVM compatibility is not perfect and the implementation on each chain is slightly different. While this can definitely make it simpler to deploy new smart contracts on a different chain, they may behave differently in a fully “compatible” environment and the claim of compatibility may increase risk that people deploy without careful consideration. We often encounter novel errors when moving smart contracts from bitcoineum testnets to the mainnet. I don’t see cross-chain deployment being easier under any conditions.\nRead more: Paul Brody - There Will Be No Lessons Learned From FTX\nAll of this aligns with our own experience, which has shown that the amount of work required to qualify a new asset or service for our audit tools on Ethereum is significantly lower than other chains. That’s because we already have a strong understanding of the underlying ecosystem. Ethereum also offers far more liquidity than any other chain, all of it inside the same ecosystem with no cross-chain bridge risk.\nOne way to anticipate how a much more regulated future looks is to examine how the biggest centralized or traditional finance firms are looking at the market for crypto assets. These firms are highly regulated and need to document their processes and work extensively to demonstrate they are not mishandling their client responsibilities. What you will see, over and over again, is that many of the biggest regulated firms have largely limited their offerings to BTC and ether (ETH) and have been very slow to grow that footprint.\nWhen the most regulated firms do start adding to the mix, my own prediction is they will begin by adding more tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem and, perhaps, adding curated sets of DeFi services from Ethereum as well. I had, in the past, expected that we would have seen this expansion during 2022. But the market turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny in the second half of last year caused many firms to move more slowly and increase their focus on compliance.\nAll of these challenges were much easier to ignore when every chain was growing, venture-capital funding was plentiful and regulatory scrutiny was light. All those sunny conditions are gone now and the game is different. Between slashing burn rates and regulatory scrutiny, the multichain era is drawing to a close.",

According to some observers, the gains are evidence of bitcoin's strengthening appeal as a hedge against the banking system.\nBitcoin picked up a strong bid near $19,600 late Friday after Silicon Valley Bank, formerly one of the top 20 lenders in the U.S., shut operations. Bitcoin's price has risen over 25% since then, reaching a nine-month high of $26,501 on Tuesday, CoinDesk data shows.\n\"Institutions aren’t buying the narrative that BTC is serious and here to stay,\" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk. \"Wealth management industry globally is very light in both bitcoin and gold.\"\nMorris, however, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the data, saying a large outflow from a single fund is mainly responsible for dragging the tally lower.\nBesides, the decline in the balance held in funds does not necessarily mean the price rally lacks strength and is unsustainable. Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said the balance held in funds accounts for a small portion of the total market and other sources of demand are lifting prices higher.\n\"The fund holdings data is not meaningful.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is flowing into wallets controlled by illiquid entities, or network participants with little-to-no spending history, at the fastest rate in six months, indicating a bias for accumulation from long-term investors.\nGlassnode's illiquid supply change metric, which measures the number of coins held by illiquid wallets on a specific date compared with the same day the previous month, rose to 147,351.58 BTC ($3.9 billion) on Monday, the most since Dec. 19. The total held by illiquid entities has jumped to a record high 15,207,843 BTC, with the tally increasing by 215,000 BTC in the past four weeks alone.\nThe data shows investors remain confident of bitcoin's price prospects despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened regulatory risks.\nLast week, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, pausing a 15-month rate-hike cycle. The bank, however, ruled out rate cuts this year while keeping the doors open for more increases if required. The so-called tightening was partly responsible for last year's crypto market swoon.\nEarly this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed lawsuits against prominent digital assets exchanges Coinbase and Binance, accusing them of offering a number of alternative cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities. The lawsuits did not mention bitcoin, triggering a rotation of money out of altcoins and into the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\nThe rate of flow into illiquid wallets is \"supporting the case for a gradual and steady accumulation taking place,\" Glassnode analyst James Check said in a weekly report published Monday, noting the record balance held by illiquid entities and the dwindling exchange balance.\n\"Overall, the market appears to be in a period of quiet accumulation, which suggests an undercurrent of demand, despite the regulatory headwinds of late,\" Check added.\nThe illiquid supply change indicator turned positive on May 24, signaling renewed accumulation, and has increased sharply since then.\nOther things being equal, faster accumulation means weakening supply in the market and potential for price rise. Technical charts suggest scope for bull revival as long as crucial support at $25,200 is held intact, that is the bitcoin price doesn't drop below that level.\nBitcoin changed hands at about $26,750 at press time, having put in a high above $27,150 during the Asian trading hours, according to CoinDesk data.\nDisclaimer: This article was written and edited by CoinDesk journalists with the sole purpose of informing the reader with accurate information.

    "content": "Singapore-based QCP Capital and Japan-based SBI Alpha Trading on Thursday said they executed an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto options trade on a regulated platform without involving a clearing house, the first such transaction in the digital asset industry.\nThe so-called uncleared trade negotiated directly between QCP and SBI Alpha used bitcoin (BTC) as collateral and was executed on Clear Markets, operators of a U.S. and U.K.-based regulated electronic marketplace, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.\nLondon-based Zodia Custody acted as a custodian for collateral while Corda Network, developed by R3, played a role in risk management.\nThe trade used a multi-custodian collateral network to ensure the assets held in custody remain separate from the custodian's assets. That way, the collateral remains safe if the custodian goes bankrupt.\nThe trading parties collected the collateral at the start of the transaction and locked the same in an account at an independent custodian, which was controlled by all three parties to mitigate the counterparty risk stemming from the absence of a clearing house. All exchange-traded derivatives and most over-the-counter derivatives involve a clearing house that validates and finalizes the transaction, ensuring the parties to the trade honor their contractual obligations.\nQCP and SBI Alpha also introduced a feature allowing real-time bolstering of collateral by periodic payments through the blockchain while protecting the collateral from loss in case of counterparty bankruptcy.\nThe unique risk management technique is consistent with International Swaps and Derivatives Association's (ISDA) requirements for uncleared derivatives in the multi-trillion dollar fiat currency swap business.\n\"This method of managing counterparty credit exposure, derived from traditional financial markets practices, eliminates significant risks taken by counterparties of FTX and other crypto trading units that have collapsed,\" the press release said.\n\"This reduces the cost of moving the collateral and enables increased frequency of variation margin payments, reducing the time between price changes and lowering the credit risk,\" the statement added.\n12:27 UTC: Updates title and the lede to say the trade was executed on a regulated platform.\nUpdates second para to say Clear Markets is based in U.S. and U.K. Corrects typo in the fifth para.",

    "content": "The upcoming Avail network will release the second phase of its “Kate” testnet, months after spinning-out from layer-2 scaling protocol Polygon, developers shared with CoinDesk.\nThe first testnet phase allowed Avail to experiment with basic operations, execute on-chain functions and run protocol governance. This second phase will include a more thorough testing environment to encourage validator participation. Validators are entities that utilize their personal computing resources to help validate network transactions and maintain security, typically in return of token rewards.\nOn the testnet, users can participate and contribute to the Avail network in multiple ways. They can acquire AVL testnet tokens to test staking and nomination functions, create modular blockchain applications or chains that publishes data to Avail, and join the testnet as validators or light clients, allowing them to verify data availability.\nAvail also intends to address “data availability” problems faced by scaling applications, its developers say. This is a complex problem faced by blockchain developers; How are nodes sure about when a new block is produced? Since all of the data on the block is actually published to the network, there is no way to detect hidden malicious transactions before publishing the data.\nAvail uses advanced mathematical techniques to assess blockchain data provided by node operators to determine the authenticity of data, without needing to rely on all node operators to verify the data, its developers claim.\nAs such, Avail plans to onboard hundreds of new validators to join, participate and engage with its community. As testnet progresses, the project aims to significantly increase its operational capacity to handle larger numbers of validators.\nThe “Kate” testnet is expected to run through the third quarter of this year.",

    "content": "Transfer of bitcoin (BTC) from miners to centralized exchanges has picked up the pace since May 31, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\nData from Glassnode shows miners or entities minting coins by verifying transactions on the blockchain have moved 6671.99 BTC ($174 million) to exchanges since May 31.

Meanwhile, the balance in wallets associated with miners has decreased by nearly 2,000 BTC in two weeks.\nThe movement of coins from miner or investor wallets to exchanges is often equated with an intention to sell or liquidate coins. As such, increased movement of coins from miners to exchanges is widely perceived as bearish.\nHowever, the recent transfers amount to just 1.3% of bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume of $13 billion and do not appear big enough to have a sizable impact on bitcoin's price.\nFurther, increased miner transfers are often taken to represent confidence in bitcoin's price prospects. The logic here is that miners' profitability is closely tied to bitcoin's price and so they step up their sales when they feel the market is strong enough to absorb extra supply. This is akin to a central bank of a current account deficit nation buying U.S. dollars in the open market when the greenback is on the offer across the board. That way it is able to build reserves without risking local currency depreciation.\nBitcoin's price continues to hover around in a familiar range above key support at $25,200, CoinDesk data show.",

Potential benefits include the build-out of broader, interoperable blockchain ecosystems.\nUnder the new plan, described in a blog post published Wednesday from the main company behind the project, StarkWare, developers can build their appchains supposedly benefit from less congestion than on Starknet mainnet. The goal is to provide an easier user experience and more transaction throughput. In addition, the appchains could potentially allow developers to implement features that are not yet available on Starknet’s mainnet.\n“The need for appchains, application-specific blockchains that are designed to service the needs of one specific application, has been apparent for several years and is now getting renewed attention,” the StarkWare team said in the blog post.\nStarknet recently also went through a major upgrade, known as ‘Quantum Leap,’ which increased the number of transactions per second (TPS) as well as reduced confirmation times. Quantum Leap is also supposed to help make Starknet’s appchains easier to build on.\nRead more: Ethereum’s Layer 2 Teams Want You to Clone Their Code",

    "content": "The Render Network Foundation on Monday proposed building its new burn-and-mint equilibrium (BME) model on the Solana blockchain, according to a post on the network’s blog.\nThe BME model, which the community approved last month, requires users to burn a predetermined amount of RNDR, the network’s native token in exchange for non-fungible work credits distributed through node operators. Migrating to Solana could support the BME model’s implementation by accelerating transaction times, mitigating the cost of transactions and offering flexibility to coders, according to the proposal.\n“I think if nothing else we need to ensure we get fast speed, but never at the expense of security in the long run,” Render founder Jules Urbach said in a statement.\nThe Render network currently builds on the Polygon blockchain but has received strong support among its users for a Solana migration. Roughly 55% of users favor making the switch to Solana, while 14% of users would prefer the network remain on Polygon, according to a community sentiment poll included in the proposal. The other 31% of users supported migrations to other blockchains, including Aptos, Ethereum and Algorand, among others.\n“The decision whether to continue with Polygon versus moving to Solana sparked a spirited debate between the pros and cons of each, with support for Solana's runtime, developer community, low transaction fees, and speed contrasting Polygon's centralization, reorg tendency, and user experience concerns,” the proposal reads.\nThe community review period will last for up to 21 days, beginning Monday.\nRead More: Blockchain-Based Render Network Token Rising After Community Vote for New Burn-and-Mint Model",

    "content": "Blockchain data shows long-term holders of bitcoin (BTC) are profitable for the first in almost a year. Historically, renewed profitability for long-term holders has presaged major market rallies.\nThe seven-day average of bitcoin's \"long-term holder spent output profit ratio,\" or LTH-SOPR, has crossed above one for the first time since May 2022, according to data tracking firm Glassnode.\nThe SOPR is the ratio in U.S. dollar value of unspent transaction output, or UTXO, at its creation to the value at which the concerned wallet spends the UTXO on-chain. UTXO is a transaction output that hasn't been used as an input in a new transaction. You can think of UTXOs as leftover change money in your pocket.\nIf wallet X sends one bitcoin to wallet Y, it is assumed that the former is spending or selling coins to the latter. If the value at which X moved coins to Y was higher than at acquisition, X is said to have realized profit. A SOPR ratio above 1 indicates that coins moved, on average, are being sold for a profit.\nThe long-term holder SOPR focuses on coins moved on-chain that have a lifespan of at least 155 days.\n\"The long-term holder SOPR variant tends to reflect macro market shifts better. Following an extended period of realized losses (LTH-SOPR < 1), the LTH cohort is finally transitioning back into a regime of profitable spending, a structure similar once again to past cycle transition points,\" Glassnode analyst James Check said in a weekly note.\nThe ratio's latest move above one comes amid bitcoin's recovery from bear market depths. At the current price of $29,500, the cryptocurrency is up 90% from the low of $15,460 recorded last November.\nThe ratio's previous crossovers dated above one – dated May 2020, May 2019 and November 2015 – also coincided with recovery rallies that eventually translated into multi-year bull runs.\nThe chart shows extreme sub-1 readings have historically marked periods of investor capitulation, which coincided with market bottoms. Meanwhile, values above 10 have signaled market tops.\nSOPR above one to create resistance\nWhile the ratio's crossover above zero might imply a positive market cycle ahead, in the short run, it could slow down the cryptocurrency's rise.\n\"The LTH cohort at the moment consists of many 2021-22 cycle holders, many of whom remain underwater and are likely to create resistance throughout the market recovery,\" Check noted.\nSouth Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant voiced a similar opinion, saying a return to profitability might inject selling pressure to the market.\n\"From an on-chain data perspective, bitcoin's price could be pressured to the downside by higher spending from whales [large investors] and long-term holders taking profits at the highest margin in almost a year,\" CryptoQuant said in a report shared with CoinDesk.",

    "title": "How to Use Etherscan and Other Blockchain Explorers",
    "summary": "There is a ton of interesting information and data available on-chain, from token transfers to seeing assets held in a wallet and more.",
    "content": "A lot of people mistake the anonymity crypto offers with transactions being private. But the majority of blockchains rely on public ledgers to work, and show each and every transaction and a host of data around those transactions to anyone who knows how to look.\nOwing to this transparency, each transfer of cryptocurrency is available for the scrutiny of public observers. But raw blockchain data is a mess that needs sorting into a more readable and usable output. Thankfully, free websites called blockchain explorers trawl through this data and refashion it into a sprawling map of the cryptocurrency market. These vast public databases let you search for a wallet or smart contract and track any transfers it has made.\nOne of the most popular blockchain explorers is called Etherscan. It’s created to track the Ethereum blockchain, but similar sites exist for other chains, like BNB Chain’s BscScan, Blockchain.com for Bitcoin or Solscan for Solana. We’ll focus on Etherscan in this guide, but you can apply much of the learning to the other blockchain explorers.\nHow to get started with Etherscan\nEtherscan is a popular blockchain explorer for Ethereum (ETH). It’s handy for tracking funds and it’s pretty powerful, too; it even lets you interact with smart contracts directly from its website. You can track the entirety of the Ethereum blockchain here, including ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Let’s start with what you can see on the front page.\nThe bottom left-hand column of the screenshot above displays all the latest blocks – batches of transactions that a blockchain validator processed all in one go. You can see how much ETH they earned for validating the transaction, how long it took and the block number (also known as the block height). The column on the bottom right displays information about individual transactions included within the latest blocks. It details who sent what to whom, how much was sent and when.\nOf course, these columns only display the latest data. Dig deeper into Etherscan and you can see all transactions from every wallet and smart contract. Clicking on the latest transaction hash reveals more information about that transaction.\nThis includes how many confirmations it received – how many times validators approved the transaction on the blockchain. You can also see the “gas price” – how much it cost, in ETH’s smallest denomination, the Gwei, to send the funds between wallets. Although all Ethereum addresses start with “0x”, some wallets are labeled, which identifies who owns the wallet. You can click on the label to see what other smart contracts or data is connected to that address. For example, these are all the accounts claimed by NFT marketplace OpenSea.\nSee Also: How to Check Your Ethereum Transaction\nYou can also interact directly with smart contracts on Etherscan and check out the code. The following screenshot is of the smart contract code for Loot, a once-popular NFT project.\nYou can see the total supply of the NFT collection, how many people hold a token from the collection and the number of people that traded the NFT. You can also see the code for the smart contract, and even interact with it by clicking on “write contract.”\nThis page once let you claim Loot NFTs. They’re all long gone; the collection sold out within a few minutes during the summer of 2021.\nMany crypto sites offer a prettier front-end website that makes it easy to interact with smart contracts, for instance, Uniswap. But while those sites make it easier, the permissionless nature of smart contracts means you can access them from anywhere, including Etherscan. So, instead of swapping tokens on Uniswap.org, you could do it on Etherscan instead.\nEtherscan also allows for the tagging of certain wallets – which is very useful when you need to follow the money. For example, it’s possible to track the wallet that drained balances from FTX accounts shortly after the exchange went bankrupt. You usually can’t see transfers from exchanges, which largely do not process trades on blockchains but instead on internal matching engines. It’s cheaper for exchanges to avoid the blockchain because they do not have to pay gas fees. That said, you can see some interesting information about exchanges, such as how much ETH crypto exchange Kraken holds in one of its wallets.\nOther blockchain explorers and tools\nAlthough this guide has focused on Etherscan, other sites function much the same. Indeed, Etherscan has several system sites through its Explorer-as-a-Service (EaaS) product, which leverages Etherscan to replicate the site on other blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Its sister site, BscScan, for instance, looks pretty much identical:\nOther explorers offer more bespoke analytics. Nansen is an advanced (and paid) explorer site that lets you track advanced statistics about the crypto market. Others, like Chainalayis, offer powerful tools to track the flow of money across several wallets. Again, unlike blockchain explorers like Etherscan, its tools are not free; indeed, law enforcement in the U.S. fork over millions of dollars to access its services, which help government agencies track down criminals.\nRead More: What Is Crypto On-Chain Analysis and How Do You Use it?",

RWA is a global trend, and this roundup of RWA news for the week ending July 27, 2023 takes you around the world.\nAvalanche Foundation Commits $50M to Bring More Tokenized Assets to Blockchain (CoinDesk)\nThe program follows Avalanche’s initiative to financial institutions to test blockchain services on one of its subnets.\nTakeaway: Blockchains such as Avalanche are competing to grab a slice of the tokenized real-world assets pie, which is projected to become a $16 trillion market by 2030 by Boston Consulting Group.\nCrypto Lender Credix Brings Additional Private Credit Pool on Solana With 11% Yield (CoinDesk)\nDecentralized finance platform Credix opens a trade receivables lending pool with the Solana Foundation among the investors.\nTakeaway: This is a single example of the creative ways crypto and TradFi are capitalizing on rising yields that are partly fueling the growth in the tokenization of real-world assets.\nAsset Tokenization in Europe Gets a Boost With Securitize's Landmark Tokenized Equity Issuance (CoinDesk)\nThe firm started issuing tokens representing equity in a Spanish real estate investment trust under Spain’s new digital asset supervision.\nTakeaway: This is another example of a specific tokenization issuance, distinguished by being the first-ever under Spain’s new digital asset supervision laws.\nTokenization is driving new value, and Asia is leading the way: Opinion (Forkast News)\nAcross Asia, projects dedicated to asset tokenization have become a cornerstone of the new digital economy, showing the world the technology’s possibilities.\nTakeaway: Asia, particularly Hong Kong, is preparing how to get a piece of the RWA market. This opinion piece describes efforts in Cambodia and Hong Kong to tokenize assets, including fiat currency.\n\"Another example on the retail side is a new pilot initiative being led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to explore and showcase real estate asset tokenization solutions. The pilot will examine and stress-test different mechanisms for enabling a faster and more efficient release of equity relative to real estate for individuals. With real-world asset tokenization predicted to be a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2030, the pilot represents a significant step forward in the race to maximize readiness for the retail application of such a tokenized product.\"\nCan we expect an NFT renaissance? (Digital Bytes)\nTakeaway: Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are associated with pixelated profile pictures that crypto enthusiasts use on their social media accounts. But as an instrument, some tokenized real-world assets are NFTs. That makes recent developments from the U.K. particularly relevant. The Law Commissioner’s report on digital assets (released in June 2023), may lead to the country becoming an NFT hub.\nSociété Générale Issued First DASP License by French Regulator AMF (Securities.io)\nTakeaway: The headline says it all; this is the first digital-asset service provider license issued by France, and it went to the blockchain arm of 150-year-old investment bank Société Générale.\n\"The DASP license, beyond giving Société Générale Forge the authority to act as a custodian for digital assets, provides the bank's blockchain unit with broad permissions. This includes,\nThe French DASP system presents a more intricate setup compared to the registration procedure for cryptocurrency companies, which typically only mandates compliance with the nation's anti-money laundering regulations.\"\nReal-World Assets: State of the Market, July 2023 (Binance Research)\nTakeaway: Notable mostly because it is produced by the research department of Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume. It is a great introduction to the tokenization of real-world assets generally and an overview of the market, with profiles of three popular protocols. While everyone (including yours truly) and their grandmother keeps citing BCG’s $16 trillion RWA market projection, Binance research takes it further to put that astounding figure in context of global asset value overall, indicating huge potential for further growth.\n\"Even at US$16T, tokenized assets will still be a small fraction of the current total global asset value, estimated to be worth US$900T (less than 1.8%, to be exact, and not factoring in future global asset value growth). One may even argue that the true addressable market is the entire global asset market, given that anything tokenizable could be represented as RWAs on-chain.\"\nRWA Tokenization: What Does it Mean to Tokenize Real-World Assets? (CoinDesk)\nTraditional finance giants are excited about the idea of putting ownership of assets like precious metals, art, homes and more on the blockchain.\nTakeaway: Toby Bochan, CoinDesk’s managing editor of Learn, introduces the concept of tokenization of real-world assets for beginners. What it is, how it works, and what the future holds. An excellent explainer to share with novice investors.\nImagine you want to buy an Andy Warhol artwork. Most of us can’t afford to fork over record-breaking sums like $195 million for a Marilyn painting or even $850,000 for a mere print of Queen Elizabeth. Many people want to buy art either for pleasure or as an investment but are priced out. But what if you could buy “shares” of an artwork like you can buy fractions of a publicly traded company? That’s the idea behind tokenization of real-world assets.",

    "content": "Crypto or Blockchain was the top area of fintech investment in Singapore in 2022 despite the global slowdown in the space, according to the KPMG Pulse of Fintech report for the second half of 2022.\nThis is despite the finding of a key trend that investors are shifting to noncrypto-based solutions in the wake of the crypto contagion in 2022. The second half of 2022 saw a \"particularly noticeable\" decline as investors digested the falls of Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX, KPMG's findings said.\nIn Singapore, crypto-related funding fell by 21% from $1.5 billion in 2021 to $1.2 billion in 2022. Globally, investments in the space fell from $30 billion in 2021 to $23.1 billion in 2022.\n\"The variance between the first half of the year and the second highlights the rapid shift in investor sentiment,\" said Anton Ruddenklau, global head of Financial Services Innovation and Fintech, KPMG International. \"But the news wasn't all negative. Regtech, in particular, saw incredible investment in 2022.\"\nThe Regtech space attracted a new high of $18.6 billion in investment, well above the previous record of $12.1 billion seen in 2021. The report said this growth is aimed at ensuring that such digital or crypto-related transactions are accurate, transparent, reliable and compliant.\nFor 2023, KPMG has predicted that it is \"likely investments in crypto-focused firms will remain very slow\" and a potential shift \"in investment to jurisdictions with stronger regulatory frameworks for crypto activities.\"\nOne trend from 2022 is expected to grow in 2023 – the shift of investors from blockchain companies focused on the retail market to startups focused on providing solutions for the SME market.\n\"While investment in crypto is expected to be particularly weak in H1 '23 ... the broader area of blockchain-based solutions – including institutional use cases, cross-border payments, gaming, and NFTs – will likely gain additional attention from investors.\"\nThe report also reflected a trend that the fintech sector is expanding access to a broader base of investors by giving the example of the $300 million raise by Singapore-based crypto firm Amber which was the second largest wealth-tech deal of the year.\nRead More: Crypto, Blockchain Investments in 2021 Exceeded Previous 3 Years Combined: KPMG",

    "content": "Stride, the Cosmos-based liquid staking protocol, is scheduled to transition to Cosmos' interchain security (ICS) system powered by ATOM tokens from the existing stride (STRD) token model.\n\"The transition will likely happen on Wednesday between 17:00 UTC and 21:30 UTC at block height 4616678,\" Stride's contributor Ian Unsworth told CoinDesk.\n\"While Stride has $35 million plus in total value locked, it only has $19 million of economic security via bonded network tokens. Following the ICS transition, block production/security will be passed to the ATOM validator set, providing roughly a 11,935.2% increase on the economic security of the network,\" Unsworth added.\nPer the official blog, the shift to ICS will boost Stride's economic security from roughly $25 million to $2.3 billion, making the liquid staking protocol more resilient to hacks.\nCosmos' interchain security leases ATOM-backed validators to consumer chains, allowing them to share Cosmos' security using ATOMS instead of their native tokens. Cosmos Hub, a blockchain intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network, runs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves ATOM tokens.\nIt means that post-transition, Stride will be secured by staked ATOM instead of STRD tokens and Cosmos' validator set will take over block production from the existing Stride validator set. Stride will essentially become a consumer chain, allowing Hub's validator to participate in its consensus. STRD will continue to have utility, generating staking rewards. At press time, the market capitalization of STRD tokens was $86.7 million, while ATOM boasted a market value of $2.73 billion, per data source Coingecko.\nThe transition will also impact STRD's tokenomics, given stakers have decided to reduce STRD distributed as staking rewards by 50%. Further, 15% of the STRD staking rewards will be shared with Cosmos Hub.\n\"STRD has a hard cap of 100 million tokens. According to the original tokenomics, in the first year, 2,608,200 STRD is emitted as staking rewards. As part of Stride’s transition to ICS, that figure will be reduced by half, to 1,304,100 STRD annualized. This reduction will be implemented in a preparatory chain upgrade prior to the transition to ICS,\" the official blog said.",

    "summary": "As the transformative technologies of generative artificial intelligence and blockchain find their way in business, inevitably they will interact. The pairing has the potential to achieve wild, weird and presently unimaginable results, but expect the first experiments to be boring and predictable, says EY's Paul Brody.",
    "content": "Everybody wants to know how blockchain and generative-AI technologies will come together, so allow me to speculate.\nFrom family dinners to weekend afternoons, I’ve spent a lot of time in the last six months playing around with generative-AI tools and thinking about how they will change “everything.” I’m more and more certain that they will have an impact, but it won’t be as enormous or as fast as some might think, particularly in the enterprise.\nLet me start with all the reasons why generative AI is going to take a while to really achieve scale in enterprise business processes and have a measurable impact on productivity.. First and foremost, enterprises achieve scale by implementing process controls and then automating systems. From inventory management to hiring, the key to scaling enterprise systems is the ability to move people’s work efforts from individual transactions or activities to management of end-to-end processes.\nPaul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.\nTake something simple like stocking a grocery store with food. Enterprise systems and retail point-of-sale (POS) systems have been carefully integrated over the years to automatically reorder out-of-stock items and, much more importantly, forecast and plan systematically to avoid ever being out of stock.\nGenerative-AI systems, by contrast, are not good at rigorously and consistently executing the same task over and over again with high precision. Ask a generative-AI system similar but not identical questions and you may get wildly different answers. This kind of variance breaks business processes built on input consistency.\nGenerative-AI systems are terrific at coming up with new ideas, and doing so at enormous speed, but business transformation is largely about change management – both people and systems. Enterprise ecosystems tend to transform at about the same rate as the slowest components in the ecosystem, not the fastest ones.\nA great example of this comes from the early era of web commerce. It was quickly possible to build web-based store fronts and accept credit-card payments. However, shipping and packaging was built and optimized for a world of pallet-sized deliveries to shops. To the extent that companies even had digital catalogs, they didn’t have pictures of products. No supervisor of a grocery store needs to know what a can of soup looks like. They already know. They’re in the store every day. As a result, e-commerce took off much more slowly than analysts expected, held back not by the web, but by warehouses and logistics systems.\nLike e-commerce, generative-AI systems will infiltrate enterprise systems alongside blockchain technology and they will eventually work very well together, but the progress will be driven by careful design and integration, not rapid, wholesale adoption. While consumers are often capable of adopting new technologies broadly in about a decade, it typically takes enterprise about 25 years and we should probably expect the same with generative AI and its integration with blockchain technology.\nA look on the bright side\nHaving gotten the bad news out of the way, let me focus on the areas where we will see the most dramatic impact of how these two technologies will work together. I’ve identified four that might come sooner rather than later.\nSoftware development\nEnterprise business processes are run on software, and generative AI systems are exceptionally good at software development. It is one of the few areas where we have strong, documented evidence that generative AI systems significantly improve productivity. Since integrating blockchains into enterprise processes is very much a matter of both process and software integration, the likely impact will be significant and felt soonest.\nAnalytics\nBlockchains do an amazing job of improving data quality. When you think about products, services, and systems that move between enterprises, one of the biggest casualties of inter-company work is data quality. In a world of silos, data is re-entered in each enterprise ecosystem. On a blockchain, tokens and hashes represent assets and data and can maintain their integrity as they move through an ecosystem. With better-quality data, expect generative-AI systems to do even better analysis.\nIt will also work the other way around: generative-AI systems are terrific at matching and interpreting patterns. They will become foundational to the business of blockchain analytics in a very short order, helping identify trends and classifying individual transactions.\nGenerative AI-training data\nOne of the biggest emerging problems for AI systems is how to find trustworthy source data. We’re in the early stages of an exa-flood of AI-generated content. Much of it will be banal, generic and mediocre. How will we know what is an authoritative, expert view on a topic or a machine-generated pattern based on other machine-generated patterns? By verifying authenticity and origin of source data using blockchain hashes.\nThe ANSA news agency in Italy already notarizes nearly 1 million articles a year using EY’s OpsChain system. This was intended to combat fake news, but in the future, tools like this may be critical for authenticating the sources of AI-training data.\nUser interfaces\nIn the same way that generative-AI systems are great at writing code, they are also good at interpreting error messages, problems and suggesting solutions. Blockchain usage is still too complex and conversational interfaces that are able to accept error messages, search for, and format suggestions and work as a “co-pilot” in a process are likely to be enormously helpful to users.\nIn the early days as new technologies evolve and interact, the results tend to be both boring and predictable, much as I have described above. We saw this with GPS and Web commerce and mobile phones. At first, we had an e-commerce experience that was little more than a paper catalog on a screen. Eventually, we ended up with push-ads coming to us in a ride-sharing vehicle proposing to have food delivered to us at our destination.\nAnd so it will be here, as blockchain and AI start to evolve and converge together. We’re in the boring phase, but just wait until things get weird and wildly unpredictable. Because they will.",

As of Tuesday, ether holders looking to become a validator on the network would have to wait for 36 days, according to data source wenmerge.com.\nCurrently, more than 50,000 perspective validators are in the queue. At press time, staking ether offers an annualized yield of 4% to 5%.\nValidators are entities tasked with processing transactions and storing data on the blockchain and need to deposit at least 32 ETH.\nEther owners continue to establish themselves as network validators, enticed by an annual yield of around 4-5 percent through token staking.\nShapella de-risked staking\nStaking, as a way of passive investing, began gathering traction after Ethereum's Beacon Chain went live in December 2020. But for three years, stakers were unable to withdraw locked coins at will, which exposed them to ether price gyrations.\nThe Shapella upgrade de-risked staking, allowing users to unlock their coins at will.\nThe recently enabled withdrawal flexibility in ETH staking, courtesy of the Shapella upgrade, mitigates its perceived risk for many investors,\" Bitfinex's analysts noted. \"Prior to this upgrade, potential stakeholders may have been deterred from staking their ETH tokens due to concerns about their funds being locked for an unacceptably long duration.\"\nThe increased demand for staking has yet to translate into a sustained ether bull run. The cryptocurrency rose by 11.5% to $2,140 in four days following the Shapella upgrade but has since retreated to trade at $1,850 at press time.",

    "summary": "The years-to-profitability ratio is a good way to evaluate a level-1 blockchain.",
    "content": "When evaluating layer-1 (L1) blockchains, many fundamental investors focus on metrics such as price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios. While these metrics are important, they ignore the programmable aspect of a blockchain’s token supply. Because a blockchain’s emissions schedule (i.e., when new tokens will enter circulation due to staking rewards and token unlocks) is known, its cost structure into the future is essentially known as well.\nThe years-to-profitability (YTP) ratio is a useful new metric for analyzing an L1’s profitability as it incorporates the blockchain’s forward supply curve. It applies the traditional finance (TradFi) concepts of breakeven analysis and payback periods to crypto. The analysis views an L1 blockchain through the lens of a business that sells secured blockspace. Revenues are the fees that users pay to record transactions on the chain, and expenses are the costs needed to secure the network. YTP calculates a blockchain’s profitability timeline by factoring in the protocol’s current revenue and cost structure, a projected growth rate (CAGR) and future supply dynamics.\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\nWe find YTP compelling because it provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating an individual blockchain or comparing multiple blockchains.\nWe start our calculation with Token Terminal’s definition of L1 profitability:\nIt is important to note that all revenues and costs are denominated in the L1’s native token. And, while unlocks and staking rewards both increase the number of tokens in circulation, the difference between transaction fees and the portion of those fees paid to proof-of-stake validators is what is used to burn or reduce the number of tokens in circulation. In this sense, YTP measures the point at which an L1’s circulating supply stabilizes at 0% inflation. Some broad assumptions we make are:\nIn comparing YTP across blockchains, it’s helpful to group the L1s by whether they have an inflationary tokenomic model or a max supply model, because with the latter, an L1 might “break even” simply because the chain’s fixed supply was reached (as modeled for SUI or ADA). Here’s an analysis for multiple blockchains, with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain excluded because they are already profitable:\nThen, by using the same set of growth rate assumptions for each chain (we calculated future CAGRs of 30%, 40% and 50%), we can make comparisons across chains and explore more deeply what drives YTP. For example, while APT has a high YTP, this is partially because the chain is relatively new and therefore its revenues are smaller than those of other more established chains. SOL has modest inflationary schedules compared to blockchains like NEAR or ICP. In all examples, a blockchain’s ability to burn tokens (and provide some kind of offset to new emissions) is helpful for managing YTP.\nIn conclusion, YTP serves as a crucial metric in evaluating the profitability and sustainability of L1 blockchains. By carefully designing tokenomics (inflationary or max supply), balancing supply dynamics and incorporating burn mechanics, L1 blockchains can aim to reduce YTP and build a more sustainable blockchain economy.\nDavid Alderman and Chris Jensen are research analysts with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets.",

    "summary": "The blockchain analytics firm has no issue doxxing wallets, because the information is already out there, their tools just make it possible to see. That’s what makes Arkham Intelligence one of CoinDesk’s Projects to Watch 2023.",
    "content": "The problem\nBlockchains are transparent, as long as you know who’s behind 0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268 or 0xCd73f4E8F50C48267E26348DF60e6d27C5DBf168.\nPrivacy on the blockchain is dependent on the ability to hide behind long, wonky addresses – pseudonymity is the natural state of a blockchain. Tens of billions of dollars move through Ethereum’s virtual pipes every day relatively unnoticed, just because people don’t know where the money came from or where it is going.\nOftentimes, that is very problematic. Blockchain’s mix of pseudonymity with an immutable record of transactions enables peers to trustlessly transact online, but it also empowers bad actors to cheat, steal and exploit.\nIf stakeholders knew where to look, they could, for example, find data that shows client and exchange funds are being co-mingled.\nOr, that Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research, once an industry giant, had a material part of its balance sheet backed by FTT, the FTX exchange token.\nRegulators are doing what they can to make sure that on-ramps into the crypto economy, like crypto exchanges, identify users as they come aboard. But know-your-customer (KYC) rules can only do so much when fresh addresses are easy to spin up and crypto mixers allow people to shield their transaction history.\nRead profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto\nThe idea: Arkham Intelligence\nCritics of cryptocurrency often accuse the sector of being skewed toward early adopters. Having a first-mover advantage, the quicker you are to a crypto project the more likely you can amass a small fortune in tokens while the price is low. Sometimes project insiders are able to benefit the most by surreptitiously collecting tokens. Other times seemingly unconnected addresses appear to collude to sway governance decisions.\nWithout putting a name to an address, it’s difficult to understand what’s being sent around. While some say that privacy is a fundamental part of crypto, there’s also another school of thought that says market fairness and equality is only found in markets that are transparent. There are legitimate needs for privacy, say the founders of blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, but the market as a whole is better off if the public knows who is making the largest trades in the ecosystem.\nArkham Intelligence hosts a relatively new platform that enables users to scrutinize blockchain addresses, inspect both sides of a transaction, track fund movements and investigate counterparty connections. Its user interface sorts data by entity and tracks the flow of funds that way as opposed to sorting things by token, which is how most of its competitors organize data.\nThe company has closed $12 million in funding, and plans to exit beta and launch publicly by the end of 2023. With its current runway, the firm plans to expand its feature set, including support for more chains, and build more tools that will be familiar to traditional finance (TradFi) users.\n“It's very difficult to actually figure out, despite its transparency, who the people behind those transactions are, what they're doing with their money,” said Miguel Morel, a founder of Arkham.\nArkham users can see the relationship between entities in real time and track relationships between the two.\nSay, for instance, a large fund makes a move on a token, either adding to its position or liquidating it. Users will be able to see what occurs and where the funds are flowing.\n“As a cryptocurrency user, you must manage your exposure at all times,” Morel says. “And you have to understand what it is that you're investing in, what it is that you're trading and what it is you're speculating in.”\nArkham’s dashboards allow for granular filtering and tracking of the relationships between addresses, so users can see where coins are going.\nFor instance, via Arkham, it’s possible to see how the entity that exploited the Euler Finance protocol is moving around the funds, including deposits into wallets controlled by North Korea’s Lazarus Group.\nSure, it’s possible to do this with a regular block explorer that’s free, but it would be a much more difficult task.\n“The good thing about blockchains is that it's not a black box. You don't need a subpoena. You don't need to wait for a judge to release information,” Morel said. “You don't need to wait for the company to release information about what's going on internally. You can just look at the books.”\nArkham Intelligence is currently in private beta. Already it has media (including CoinDesk), crypto exchanges, hedge funds and other financial institutions as users. It gained a significant amount of buzz around the time of the FTX collapse, shortly before/after it launched, because of the company’s Twitter threads outlining and helping to explain the odd flow of funds at the defunct exchange.\nTransparency versus anonymity\nMorel said he was motivated to build Arkham to remove pseudonymity from blockchains.\nWhile some believe this forced unveiling is antithetical to crypto, Morel disagrees.\nMorel says that even before he started Arkham he saw that there were two narratives within the crypto industry: one that highlights the transparency and decentralization of blockchain, and another that emphasizes its privacy and pseudonymity.\n\"And they're both true, or at least they were both true. Mostly because while the blockchains are completely transparent, auditable and public with their information, it's incredibly difficult to actually use that data,” he said. “With Arkham, that's actually what I wanted to… I wanted to marry that as an idea.”\nAll the necessary data to tell who's who on-chain is public and transparent, but unless you know the entity behind an address this trove of data is useless for the average user.\n“People are publicly broadcasting to everyone their activity on a minute-by-minute basis, every single time they make a transaction,” he said. “We're basically just making software that matches that information to the relevant person and then shows that to the end user.”\nAfter all, why should the right of a large investor’s anonymity trump that of a retail user wanting to know what they are investing in?\nMorel points out that traditional finance also has a similar problem with opaqueness, but there are remedies for this, such as the 13F form the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires people or funds to file when they manage over $100 million in assets and take positions in listed companies.\n“What we’re building is 10 times, 100 times, 100 times more granular than that,” Morel said.",

    "content": "Ethereum developers, fresh off of last month's successful Shapella upgrade, which enabled staked ETH withdrawals, are already moving full-steam ahead in planning the next major change that the blockchain will undergo.\nGet ready for “Dencun.”\nThe name is a portmanteau of two simultaneous upgrades happening on the two main layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, where all protocol rules reside, will undergo the “Cancun” upgrade, while on the consensus layer, which makes sure that blocks are validated, it’s known as “Deneb.”\nSo developers are cleverly referring to the whole thing as “Dencun” – just like they Brangelina-d the simultaneous Shanghai and Capella upgrades into “Shapella”.\nAt the heart of Dencun is EIP 4844, more commonly known as “proto-danksharding.” The proposal aims to scale the blockchain by increasing space for “blobs” of data. The changes are also expected to reduce fees for layer 2 rollups.\nAhead of Shapella, developers decided that EIP 4844 would be pushed to the next upgrade, given it was too big of a task to include with staked ETH withdrawals.\nOn an official call Thursday, Ethereum developers delved into the technical details of EIP 4844.\nTim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, who conducts these bi-monthly meetings, opened the meeting with, “I'll assume that, by default, we sort of keep this scope for Cancun and if anybody wants to change it going forward, just put something in the agenda.” (Dencun doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, and the developers themselves sometimes just say “Cancun.”)\nThe developers didn’t discuss the timing of the Dencun upgrade on Thursday, though they have said in the past that their aim is to push it live in the second half of 2023.\nDencun is also expected to include a few other technical upgrades known as EIPs 6780, 6475 and 1153.\nAs for the full scope of what Dencun will look like? That’s to be determined over the next few weeks. The developers are testing out other EIPs before they solidify what other proposals will make it into the next big hard fork.\nRead more: What’s Next After Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade?",

    "content": "Self-styled crypto skeptic Michael Hsu, the acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said tokenization of assets is a serious advance into the future of finance, but decentralized blockchains may be too problematic to handle that movement.\nAchieving decentralization, security and scale all at once “is not possible with a public blockchain,” Hsu said at an American Bankers Association event on Friday.\n“As a result, the crypto industry remains largely self-referential and disconnected from the real world,” he said. The sector is “immature and rife with risks, despite several years in the mainstream spotlight, billions of dollars of venture capital investment and millions of hours of code commits.”\nThough U.S. banking regulators including the OCC have warned the institutions they regulate that involvement in crypto needs exacting scrutiny, a number of financial firms – including Wall Street banks – have experimented with managing their own blockchain projects. Hsu said such “centrally operated, trusted blockchains have the potential to deliver security and achieve scale efficiently.” He added that tokenization “does not require decentralization and trustlessness.”\n“With tokenization, the instruction, transaction, and settlement can theoretically be collapsed into a single step, removing those frictions – provided, of course, that the technology is interoperable with central bank money and real-world settlement systems,” he said. “The legal foundations for tokenization need to be developed.”\nRead More: Wall Street Giant DTCC Launches Private Blockchain in Big Crypto-Milestone for TradFi",

It doesn’t really make sense to have all these blockchains if they can’t talk to each other.”\nChang, who was previously a product manager at decentralized-finance protocol Aave, is working with Cata Labs co-founder Alexander Lindgren to launch Catalyst.\nCatalyst is different from existing bridges in that it can come already integrated into blockchains that opt into its ecosystem, forgoing the laborious and manual integration process characteristic of bridges such as Wormhole.\nRead More: Celestia Labs Raises $55M to Build Modular Blockchain Network\nCatalyst’s thesis is that the future will hold thousands of modular blockchains that will need to communicate with each other. Modular blockchains are easier to deploy than traditional blockchains and break down the core functions of a blockchain into several different specialized blockchains.\n“With the proliferation of rollups and app-specific chains, liquidity fragmentation is becoming a significant pain point and we have yet to see a unified liquidity layer that allows users to trade native assets seamlessly and efficiently cross-chain,” said Kelvin Koh, managing director of Spartan Group. “We believe Catalyst is in a great position to solve this pain point.”\nA major challenge for the modular thesis, however, is attracting user activity onto its blockchains. “At the end of the day, all of these bridges are in a winner-takes-all race to build network effects,” Chang said.\nUPDATE (April 26, 2023, 17:34 UTC): Wormhole is backed by Jump Crypto, not Jump Capital.",

    "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) near-term outlook appears constructive as blockchain data show short-term holders of the cryptocurrency are moving coins at a profit.\nThe seven-day moving average of the short-term holder's (STH) spent output profit ratio (SOPR) has recently moved back above 1, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\"After a brief stint of coins moving at a loss, STH-SOPR is now back above 1,\" analysts at Blockware Solutions said in a weekly newsletter. \"This is bullish for near-term price action as it shows capitulation from short-term holders.\"\nThe short-term holder SOPR of more than 1 means the average short-term holder in the market is selling coins at a profit. A reading below 1 is considered a sign of capitulation, while a reading of 1 indicates the average short-term holder is just breaking even.\nThe SOPR is calculated by dividing the realized dollar value of a spent output (UTXO) by the value at output creation to reflect the degree of realized profit for all coins moved on-chain. The short-term holder SOPR is focused on all wallets that have held onto their coins for less than 155 days.\nThe STH SOPR has historically stayed above 1 during bull markets. That's understandable, as rallies allow short-term holders – mostly new entrants, active traders or weak hands – to liquidate their holdings at a price higher than the acquisition cost.\nBesides, the area around 1 tends to act as a support level during bull runs, as holders, expecting continued price rallies, see their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity. On the flip side, level 1 acts as resistance during bearish trends.\nThe STH SOPR crossed above 1 in January, signaling a bullish trend reversal and has since tested the support twice. Bitcoin has rallied over 68% this year, according to CoinDesk data. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading near $27,900, having put in a high of $28,441 during the overnight trade, CoinDesk data show.\nBitcoin's long-term holders also turned profitable a month ago, signaling a major bullish period ahead.",

I would propose that there are some areas where AI and Web3 combined can truly help society tackle its most complicated problems. Here’s one potential view of what this could look like, with 100% feasibility based on the state of the tech today.\nSome things AI is good at:\nSome things blockchains are good at:\nSome things humans are good at:\nWhat happens when we mix all of these together in a symbiotic relationship to tackle a complex problem? I mean a REALLY complex, global-scale problem that has eluded humans for generations, or a “wicked problem,” like curing cancer. This requires coordinating the actions and wishes of thousands of people; making high stakes decisions about strategy and resource allocation; and a massive amount of management across many industries and jurisdictions.\nHow It Could All Work\nSo let’s imagine a Curing Cancer DAO. Founded by a consortium of scientific research labs, academic departments, and disease communities, totaling 1,000 people at the start. They decide on their shared mission and assign a small governance group of experts who will make strategic decisions. They initiate a DAO with membership NFTs for each participant with different governance responsibility levels and allocate a pool of funding to kick it off, and they instate an AI agent to manage the project as it scales.\nThe governance board assigns a list of KPIs to the AI agent, asking it to complete a set of management tasks for the community. Let’s say those start out as: manage donations to the treasury, keep track of new members, and disburse payments for work done on behalf of the DAO according to a clear set of deliverables. This will save a lot of time and overhead, which tend to consume a lot of resources for a not-for-profit organization or for a DAO.\nMore importantly, the board also tasks the AI agent with assessing the requirements to make progress on curing cancer and crafting a proposal with a roadmap of work, sub-projects, possible participants and institutions around the world who would be good to get involved, and specific tasks that will need to be done. The agent comes up with a long-term plan and proposes a set of steps to execute on it, then submits to the board of experts for review.\nThe board makes adjustments and prioritizes across the proposed roadmap from the AI to cover the first six months of work on Curing Cancer DAO. They empower the AI agent to recruit people to do those tasks, assign people work (no matter how big or small), and assess how well the work was done, paying them from the treasury.\nThe AI agent creates updates to the roadmap and reports progress frequently to all stakeholders in the DAO, managing a global view of this complex project in a way that makes it much easier for local contributions to be made effectively and in real-time context. Over time, it can expand the project by proposing sub-communities, managing experiments, and helping coordinate across the growing membership, even interacting with multiple boards managing different areas of expertise.\nThe DAO board can veto any proposal from the agent or rework it so things can get more efficient as they make progress. Over time, if the governance board observes that the AI agent is not doing well at something, they can commission new training data in that specific area in order to improve the model and fine-tune it to fit their needs. This can even be crowd sourced onchain from among an expert community, who can review the work and assess the AI agent’s improvement.\nAI, Web3’s Role\nThis vision actually wouldn’t be possible without both AI and Web3. We need the Web3 part for governance, for the financial aspect, for the coordination tooling. All of the AI’s actions are onchain, membership of the group and donations are managed via blockchain tooling, and it can work directly with the DAO treasury to carry out transactions with total transparency. AI can streamline every part of the process of running the Curing Cancer DAO, as long as it is working alongside expert humans and with oversight and transparency assisted by blockchains. If it’s all on a blockchain, we can monitor risk and manage trust much better than we can even in today’s primarily social systems.\nThis is a very high level example, but I hope it prompts us to think in an optimistic direction about how we can become more effective at problem solving when we use AI and Web3 creatively. We will be able to scale up a lot of things that have been too complicated to manage just socially, or just with top-down command and control, or just with blockchains. This decentralized science community-building example could also apply to any global coordination problem or research effort.\nNone of these technologies are as interesting in isolation as they are when combined: It’s not about AI doing whole jobs themselves, but rather, about it doing what we are bad at, and helping us coordinate and do it faster. We will start to see some powerful experiments emerging in the next few years if we focus on productive building with proactive risk management, instating checks and balances that maximize the best of human and tech participants in service of a shared mission.",

    "content": "Austin, Texas — USDC issuer Circle Internet Financial on Wednesday released a new method to move the major stablecoin between blockchains that it says is faster, safer and cheaper than the “bridges” that are widely used in decentralized finance.\nCalled the “Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol,” or CCTP, the technology will be used initially for USDC transfers between the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, with more chains coming in the second half of 2023. DeFi apps can integrate relevant smart contracts to make it easy for users to move their stablecoins.\nThe technology attempts to break down the barriers now fragmenting USDC’s $30 billion market cap across many different blockchains. Though Circle issues “native” USDC on many top networks, including Ethereum and Avalanche, those asset tranches were more or less partitioned; those who wanted to \"bridge\" the divide had to engage in complicated and sometimes expensive cross-chain transfers.\nRead full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.\nCircle’s new method seeks to replace bridges, which solved that problem by creating another asset, a derivative token called a wrapped asset. CCTP works by destroying USDC on the source chain and recreating it on the destination chain.\nThe process could pay the biggest dividends when it comes to asset swaps. It could be used to move cross-chain and cross-token transfers behind the scenes.\n“With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe and fungible asset in native USDC. This milestone makes USDC a natively multi-chain digital dollar,” Joao Reginatto, vice president of product, said in a press release.\nWallet company MetaMask, bridge operator Wormhole and bridge aggregator LI.FI are among the infrastructure providers with CCTP coverage at launch.\nCircle couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\nRead more: USDC Stablecoin Strengthened by U.S. Banking Crisis in March, Circle CEO Says",

    "summary": "Blockchains face existential peril from super-fast computers that can break the encryption protocols on which crypto depends. Quantum computers aren’t here yet, but if developers wait to devise defenses the fight will be over before it’s begun. That’s why BTQ is one of CoinDesk’s Projects to Watch 2023.",
    "content": "The problem\nRight now, nations are engaging in a technological arms race to develop quantum computing technology. Chinese researchers, who hold over half of the world's quantum technology patents and have allocated $15 billion towards quantum technology to be spent before 2025, claim their technology can break the RSA algorithm that is used to encrypt the majority of the web’s traffic.\nEncryption is the backbone of a modern connected world. It ensures that banking is done securely, sensitive emails are not read by a third party and blockchain networks remain secure, trustworthy and free of double-spent transactions.\nQuantum computing poses a threat to current encryption methods because it has the potential to break many of the most widely used encryption protocols. This is because quantum computers are capable of performing certain types of calculations much faster than traditional computers, which makes it possible for them to quickly factor large numbers that are used in many encryption algorithms.\nFor blockchain, encryption is essential and therefore its vulnerability is an Achilles' heel. The entire idea of on-chain scarcity is anchored in encryption. Data can be stored, but never edited, which is why the same bitcoin or non-fungible token (NFT) can’t exist twice.\nThe Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the most widely used cryptographic algorithm implemented by blockchains today. It has a severe weakness to a quantum attack because it was designed to be used in pre-quantum computers, which could be exploited by hostile actors ranging from market manipulators to states that are anti-crypto.\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has made post-quantum computing (PQC) security upgrades a primary focus of the platform. In order for blockchains to remain secure and viable in the next era of computing, when traditional encryption mechanisms are vulnerable to quantum attacks, they will need to upgrade their security.\nRead profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto\nThe idea: BTQ\nBTQ isn’t the first quantum computing startup on the market. Dozens of quantum startups have been around for the better part of a decade, backed by recognizable names in computing and technology. But BTQ is the first quantum computing startup with a specific focus on blockchain technology.\n“Large-scale quantum computers won't exist for many years. However, that doesn't mean we should sit idle,” says Nicolas Roussy Newton, BTQ’s co-founder and chief operating officer. “There's a real risk attackers will be able to forge signatures for old keys such as blockchains. And deploying new post-quantum cryptography at scale could take 10 years.”\nRoussy Newton, a Canadian with prior experience in venture capital, says this from Taiwan, a frontier state at the doorstep of China – one of the world’s leaders in quantum computing research. Taiwan doesn’t have the same scale of quantum computing research, yet, but it does have a workforce with plenty of experience in marrying hardware and software, given the island’s leading industry of chip making. BTQ’s leadership, such as Chief Cryptographer Chen-Mou Cheng, have a heavy roster of academic citations in computer science and other technical journals.\nWhile China’s quantum research seems to be focused on military purposes, such as decrypting classified military communications between Taipei and Washington, D.C., the same technology could be used to disrupt crypto and digital assets.\nOver the next few years there will be a rapid “quantum transition,” where all of Web2 – which drives hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce every year – moves towards quantum-proof standards.\nBut what about Web3? Digital assets are a $1.27 trillion asset class and are now facing an existential threat. Chains will need to transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards to remain viable in the long term, or else the entire idea of scarcity and ownership on the web will cease to exist.\nBTQ is unique as instead of having a broad, theoretical, focus on Quantum computing, it has four products that address different aspects of the “quantum problem\": PQScale, Keelung, Kenting, and QCIM.\nPQScale\nDigital signature algorithms, the code that helps transition and secure post-quantum encryption, can’t be fit into blockchains like a lego block. It’s as if the blocks are misshapen and the wrong size.\nLast year the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a branch of the Department of Commerce with a mandate to help assist the advancement of technology, announced three post-quantum digital signature algorithms, CRYSTALS–Dilithium, Falcon and SPHINCS+, designed to protect encryption schemes from Quantum-computing based attacks.\nWhile it would make sense to try and immediately integrate these algorithms into blockchains, it’s not that simple. Adding in these signatures would be computationally intense and would enlarge the blockchain to a point where it has efficiency issues.\nBTQ is positioning PQScale as a solution to this problem.\nPQScale’s approach involves combining multiple Falcon signatures while significantly reducing the size of the combined signature. This method can potentially be adapted for other similar security frameworks as well.\nKeelung and Kenting\nZero-knowledge proofs are a pillar of security for the next generation of blockchain technology. But how can these be implemented on both the hardware and software side?\nA zero-knowledge proof is like a secret password game where one person can prove they know the password without actually saying it out loud. In this game, one person (the \"prover\") wants to show they know the secret, while the other person (the \"verifier\") wants to check if it's true without learning the secret themselves. The game uses special rules that help the prover show they know the secret without revealing it.\nFor blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs have vast potential to enhance privacy and security. With ZKPs, counterparties don't need to trust each other or use a third-party escrow service to complete a transaction.\nBTQ is positioning Keelung and Kenting – named for two coastal cities in Taiwan – as a system for ZKP implementation, with Keelung on the software side and Kenting on the hardware side.\nWith Keelung, users can create ZKPs without specific expertise in cryptography, while Kenting is a hardware system that uses field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), a special type of computer chip that can be reconfigured and customized to perform specific tasks, to support the intense computational demands of ZKPs.\nQCIM\nEventually, everything that uses encryption will need to have some sort of compatibility with quantum cryptography. But what about smart devices that have a low-powered processor inside?\nQCIM is BTQ’s specialized processor for post-quantum cryptography but is targeted specifically at lower-power applications such as the Internet of Things.\nQCIM leverages compute-in-memory technology that integrates logic circuits into memory blocks in order to achieve highly energy-efficient computations by reducing data movements.\nWhile quantum computing is thought of as only existing in laboratories, the proliferation of post-quantum encryption will mean that chips capable of post-quantum cryptography will need to be wherever encryption is needed, from security cameras to drones to smartphones and even satellites.\nQuantum computing is an esoteric subject that, to many, looks like a moon shot. After all, the threat of quantum currently only exists on paper.\nBut in the tech world, the pace of research and development is fast and furious. Rewind to a few years ago, and artificial intelligence language learning models were relatively primitive. Today, ChatGPT is able to pass any state’s bar exam.\nIf tokenization and digital assets are the future of money, they need to be able to survive the rise of quantum computing and its ability to destroy encryption algorithms that form the basis of blockchain.",

    "summary": "The recent addition of Bitcoin NFTs has added a new player in the non-fungible token space, but Bitcoin Ordinals have a long way to go before they reach the heights of NFTs on Ethereum or other top blockchains like Solana and Polygon.",
    "content": "Non-fungible tokens (NFT) took off during the crypto bull run of 2021. In less than a year, blockchain-based digital assets went from being an obscure technicality to a maturing asset class.\nNFTs including celebrity-favorite Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Beeple’s $69 million digital artwork sale brought much public attention to Ethereum, the blockchain that hosts the most high-profile NFTs. Many people now associate NFTs with Ethereum. After all, the network has processed more than $37 billion in NFT trades. No other chain comes close.\nBut Ethereum isn’t the only NFT blockchain. Any blockchain with smart-contract capabilities can support NFTs. Indeed, some have thriving NFT ecosystems, if not as developed as that of Ethereum.\n“Top NFT blockchains” is a tough list to make precisely because the ranking frequently changes as the crypto industry continuously evolves. But some chains such as Ethereum and Solana have established firm positions in the NFT blockchain leaderboard. For others, the competition is more fierce.\nEthereum\nEthereum’s the king of all NFT chains. Its popularity even surprised Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder.\nThe technical development that made NFTs possible on Ethereum took place in 2015 when developers introduced the ERC-721, a non-fungible token standard. But it wasn’t until 2021 the NFT market on Ethereum truly blossomed. During the height of the NFT bull run, historical NFTs, which predate 2020, became highly prized.\nSome of the most popular NFT projects such as CryptoPunks are native to Ethereum, which inspired a myriad of profile picture-style (PFP) NFT projects. Until late in 2022 most of the trading took place on OpenSea, the multichain marketplace that originally began on Ethereum. OpenSea facilitated billions of dollars in NFTs during the bull market.\nSince pro-focused NFT marketplace Blur launched in October 2022, a huge shift in trading volume for ETH-based NFTs has occurred, with Blur’s trading volume overtaking OpenSea in February 2023 for the first time.\nThe popularity of NFTs on Ethereum has a downside. When the NFT trade becomes too hot the network gets clogged, sending the network’s transaction fees, known as gas, to sky-high levels. When Yuga Labs launched its “Otherdeeds” NFTs on Ethereum in 2022, gas fees cost investors over $100 million, with single transactions racking up $3,000 fees.\nSolana\nSolana has climbed to be the second-biggest NFT chain with a fledgling NFT ecosystem of its own.\nMagic Eden, the chain’s biggest NFT marketplace, has recorded over $1 billion in trading volume so far. At one point in May 2022, the Solana-native marketplace even topped OpenSea’s NFT Ethereum trading volume. As of April 2022, OpenSea also began supporting Solana NFTs.\nTo buy and sell Solana NFTs, you need a Solana-compatible wallet such as Trust Wallet, Exodus Wallet or Phantom. The wallet needs to be topped up with enough SOL to pay any gas fees, which are generally lower than on Ethereum, generally only a fraction of a penny.\nIn the early days of Solana’s NFT ecosystem, the network was filled with Ethereum NFT knockoffs. These included Degen Apes, inspired by BAYC; and SolPenguins, inspired by Pudgy Penguins. As the network’s NFT ecosystem grew, original projects including Okay Bears and DeGods became household names for Solana – so much so that Okay Bears got copied onto Ethereum.\nDeGods and Y00ts were so successful that another up-and-coming NFT blockchain, Polygon, paid them to migrate to their ecosystem in January 2023.\nPolygon\nPolygon is what's known as a sidechain or scaling tool for Ethereum, and essentially was created to help reduce costs and the increase speed of transactions.\nA relative newcomer to the NFT marketshare battle, Polygon has made impressive progress not only by bringing over high-profile projects like Y00ts and DeGods, but also by working with notable personalities for NFT launches, such as Former President Donald Trump’s first foray into NFTs.\nMost notably, Polygon has driven adoption by working with many mainstream brands to launch their own NFT projects. To date, Polygon powers Starbucks’ Odyssey program, Reddit’s wildly popular digital avatars, Nike’s .swoosh platform, Meta Platforms’ integration of NFTs on Instagram and DraftKing’s NFT marketplace.\nNFT marketplaces OpenSea, Magic Eden and most recently, Rarible support NFTs minted on Polygon. To date, Polygon has done over $700 million in trading volume, according to CryptoSlam.\nFlow\nFlow grew out of frustration with the NFT experience on Ethereum.\nCat-breeding NFT game CryptoKitties clogged Ethereum in 2017, prompting Dapper Labs, the company behind the project, to launch an alternative blockchain for games and consumer applications.\nToday, Flow is best known for NBA Top Shot, the NFT collectibles of National Basketball Association highlights. It was one of most popular NFT projects until the profile-picture NFT trend took over as of mid-2021, which has led to Flow falling behind some of the other chains in terms of volume. As of writing, Flow has done over $1 billion in trading volume, but the activity has taken a dramatic downturn since its all-time high of over $244 million in February 2021. Two years later, Flow had just over $6 million in trading volume.\nNBA Top Shot is just one among many big-IP projects on Flow. The chain is especially popular with top sports brands. Branded projects building on Flow include NFL ALL DAY, Ticketmaster, UFC Strike, Mattel, LaLiga Golazos, Seussibles (Dr. Seuss), Gaia, Genies and Aera by OneFootball.\nDapper Labs has a significant presence on the network and Dapper Wallet is the most popular wallet for Flow. Dapper’s centralized control of Flow and NBA Top Shots has recently led to some legal battles for the company, which is facing a class-action lawsuit involving its Top Shot NFTs.",

The extra boost can make all the difference in high-traffic situations, like a fleeting crypto-trading arbitrage opportunity or in the scramble for a hot non-fungible token (NFT) mint.\nIn one recent epoch (the blockchain’s time period for validators) nearly three-quarters of all nonvote transactions had priority fees attached, per data from validator statistics service Solana Compass. That rate set a new high water mark for priority fee adoption, which has been growing all year.\nThe average transaction fee Solana users paid in that epoch (epoch 402) was 0.000014641 SOL, a 67% increase over rates in early July but still only fractions of a penny based on the current market price. That added up to 963 SOL spent on priority fees last epoch, or nearly $24,000 – a rounding error based on the overall value moving across the network.\n“Most users can pay 100x current costs and not care since it's still sub-cent,” the pseudonymous 7Layer, who runs Overclock validator service, said in a Twitter DM.\nThe priority fees are helping bring order to a network that’s had its share of chaos, most memorably and infamously at the hands of trading bots who in 2021 spammed the network into oblivion. Developers say such things shouldn’t happen under the new tech regime.\nTrade-Offs\nSolana’s trade-off between price and speed isn’t nearly as poignant as on Ethereum, where congestion in one corner of the network makes doing business expensive for everyone. That’s because Solana’s architecture is built to handle many transactions at once, said Austin Federa, head of strategy for the Solana Foundation.\nFor example: If lots of traders are trying to swap BONK tokens for the stablecoin USDC on the same exchange at once, they might start paying priority fees to ensure their trades go through at the prices they want. But even during that high traffic time, the local fee market for minting an NFT elsewhere on Solana won’t get more expensive. On Ethereum it would.\nJonny Platt, CEO of Solana Compass, told CoinDesk priority fees are changing the economics of running his validators on Solana. He said average block rewards are 20% higher year over year.\nHalf of the value of priority fees go to validators such as Platt as reward for lending their compute power to the network; the other half of the priority fee gets burned. Platt said this burn mechanism should drive more value into SOL tokens over time by making the tokens more scarce.\n“So many normal everyday users of Solana are excited to see this because there’s recognition that we’ve improved over last year,” Platt said of priority fees.\nOutrageous outages\nSolana suffered multiple well-documented (and excoriated) network outages in 2022 and 2021, some of which were driven by bots pummeling one corner of the blockchain simultaneously. In one such outage, in September 2021, bots crowded a token sale on exchange Raydium with more transactions than Solana could handle. Solana basically broke, going offline for 17 hours – an eon in 24/7 cryptocurrency markets.\nTo address the spam issue, core developers began a year-long effort to change how Solana handles transactions. It would ditch the “first-come-first-served” transaction execution model for “fee markets” that gave favor to those who paid for priority.\nSolana transaction fees are the sum of a static base fee plus a dynamic computational fee. With priority fees, users who want faster execution can opt to pay some extra SOL. Bots who previously spammed the network for dominance won’t win on transaction volume alone, validators said.\n“It reduces the incentive because priority based on fee matters more instead of just spamming hard to get in front of the queue,” 7Layer said. “There haven't been any spam issues close to what they used to be.”\nPriority fees haven’t completely solved Solana’s spam issue, said St. Gnu, another pseudonymous validator. The network is extremely cheap to do business on, extra fees or not. He said Solana’s core developers will need to build out more fee features that make spamming less economical.\n“The issue is that if you want to just ‘spray and pray’ a bunch of transactions there's not really a big cost to do that,” he said in a Telegram message.",

    "content": "Tech startup Monad Labs, founded by the former team from traditional finance (TradFi) giant Jump Trading, raised $19 million in seed funding to develop a new blockchain that aims to improve on issues faced by current layer 1 protocols.\nThe Monad blockchain will launch on a testnet in the coming months, with the mainnet deployment planned for later this year, according to a statement. The blockchain will employ the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and will be Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible. As such, projects on Monad will be able to interact with the EVM software platform, where developers from many other blockchain projects also create interoperable decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\n\"The Monad blockchain will set the industry standards for the speed, transparency, security and scalability that all Layer 1 protocols should have,\" said Keone Hon, co-founder and CEO of Monad Lab, in the statement.\nThe funding round for Monad was led by crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital with the participation of 70 other investors, including Placeholder Capital, Lemniscap, Shima Capital, Finality Capital, as well as angel investors in the digital asset space including Naval Ravikant, Cobie, and Hasu, the statement said.\nRedesigned blockchain\nOver the few years, builders in the space have often been held back by high-cost and low reward on many layer 1 blockchains. This, in turn, affects innovation and mass adoption of the decentralized applications (dapps) by the developers.\nMonad plans to address these issues through its new layer 1 protocol, which it claims will be able to process a total of 10,000 transactions per second. To do so, Monad made some key changes to the consensus and execution layers – two major mechanisms of a blockchain.\n\"We redesigned the EVM execution system from the ground up to allow non-overlapping transactions to be run in parallel,\" said Eunice Giarta, co-founder and chief operating officer of Monad Labs. The team also remodeled the integration system between the two mechanisms to allow the blockchain’s execution layer to run in parallel to consensus, she noted.\n\"Together, these improvements massively improve the system throughput, allowing the system to scale to many more users and applications,\" Giarta added.\nEthereum, the original smart contract blockchain, still holds the majority of the market share among layer 1 projects. However, there have been several new blockchains – dubbed “Ethereum Killers” – that are looking to improve Ethereum's processing time, fees and scalability. Some of the more popular layer 1 blockchains include Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and Internet Computer.\nAs more traditional financial entities enter the space, focus is turning increasingly into scalability and speed of blockchains. Monad’s team is seeking to capture this opportunity to build an improved version of a layer 1 blockchain.\n“With a founding team that originated from Jump, Monad Labs understands the need for speed,” said Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder Capital, in the statement. “The [Monad] team is in the midst of parallelizing the EVM, creating a blockchain network and EVM-environment that rivals the performance of traditional tech and finance,” he added.\nRead more: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023?",

    "content": "Shiba inu's (SHIB) price fell 10% in the past 24 hours amid drama surrounding the codebase of the upcoming Shibarium blockchain.\nThe much-awaited Shibarium blockchain released its beta version for the layer 2 network last week, as CoinDesk reported. A beta testnet is a blockchain that mimics real-world functioning. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1 protocols that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.\nHowever, the euphoria surrounding the launch paused on Thursday morning after a top-ranked community member on Shiba Inu’s Discord channel flagged concerns. The concerns came from Shibarium beta testnet using the same Chain ID as an existing blockchain.\n“Chain ID is the simplest thing any Blockchain dev looks for first when deploying a Blockchain,” community member Steve wrote. “As using an ID that already exists is just incompetent as your chain wouldn't work properly and everyone trying to interact with your chain would instead interact with the other chain.”\n“Why is it that it looks like shibarium test net has taken rinia testnet genesis file. Changed the name from renia. But forgot to change the chain ID,” Steve added.\nDevelopers and other prominent community members were quick to address the concerns. “There is absolutely no evidence that this is a fork of a chain that launched last month,” wrote one JesusM on the Discord channel. “Code is forked all the time. Moreover, there is no confirmation that it was.”\nDiscord user “Justinlime,” another network validator, chimed in: “Even if some of the code was used in the beta does not mean all of it was. To me it's very doubtful that it's a direct fork with nothing changed. Forking, and building upon already established software, is the core foundation of what FOSS (free and open source software) stands for.”\nShiba Inu ecosystem tokens BONE and LEASH were also down more than 10% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.",

    "summary": "Fabian Vogelsteller is launching his new project, a layer 1 blockchain “LUKSO,” and validators will be able to join the network through the Genesis Validator Smart Contract Deposit.",
    "content": "Fabian Vogelsteller, an Ethereum veteran who helped shape the ecosystem in the early days, is taking on a new venture – a blockchain to succeed where he says others have failed, in catering to creative, fashion-oriented and art-world types.\nOne of the 39-year-old, self-taught German programmer’s most significant contributions to Ethereum was the invention of ERC-20, the blueprint for creating tokens that are compatible with the blockchain. That innovation led to the infamous initial coin offering boom of 2017-2018. Several of the biggest tokens by market capitalization are based on the standard, including Uniswap’s UNI, Shiba Inu’s SHIB and Arbitrum’s new ARB.\nVogelsteller is now turning his attention to a new project, LUKSO, a soon-to-be-launched layer 1 blockchain that he says is designed for the “creative economy.” It would compete with Ethereum itself, by far the dominant smart-contracts blockchain with a market capitalization of $217 billion.\nThe explosion in NFTs for everything from collectibles to art and music, along with a plethora of imagined metaverses, is a good reflection of the potential for creative-type applications on the blockchain, according to Vogelsteller. But he says the systems are nowhere near maturity and not easy enough to use.\n“One of the advantages for starting a new network was thinking about how we can improve the basic direction of the blockchain,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk.\nLUKSO will have a window of opportunity for validators to join the network. There will be a Genesis Validator Deposit Smart Contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which will go live in a few weeks.\nJust like Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin, LUKSO will be born out of Ethereum, Vogelsteller told CoinDesk: “We use Ethereum as an on-ramp in a way, like Ethereum used the Bitcoin network.”\nOn LUKSO, the Genesis Validator Deposit Smart Contract will allow users to deposit LYXe, an ERC-20 token that went live in a reversible ICO round in June 2020, to become a genesis validator. (Once the mainnet goes live, LYXe will be converted to LYX, the native token for LUKSO.)\nEach validator on the LUKSO blockchain needs to lock up 32 LYXe in order to participate in the block validation process – similar to the 32 ETH that’s required to be “staked” on Ethereum to participate as a validator.\nSelf-taught coder\nAccording to Vogelsteller, what’s stopping Ethereum from becoming adopted on a mass scale is that the applications aren't making the user experience easy. It’s hard for the average person to understand what address belongs to which wallet, and it takes effort to follow the movement of transactions on the chain. To solve this, LUKSO will introduce a comprehensive all-in-one profile that brings on-chain activity under a single entity, known as a “universal profile.”\nVogelsteller was born in the tiny German town of Unterwirbach in Bavaria where he says he never really fit in. He moved to another small city in southwest Germany where he finished his studies at Schmalkalden. He studied media design at the Bauhaus University in Weimar.\n“I never studied computer science or anything technical. Everything I know I learned by myself coding websites since I was 14,” Vogelsteller said.\nIn 2013, Vogelsteller first learned about blockchains. He also happened to meet the original Ethereum team a day before their pre-sale. Six months later, Vogesteller started working for the Ethereum Foundation in Berlin, where he built the first Web3 browser, the first Ethereum wallet and other developer tools.\nDuring his time at the Ethereum Foundation, Vogelsteller, together with Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, pioneered ERC-20, which created a set of rules that tokens on Ethereum blockchain have to adhere to, making it easier for developers to know how any new ERC-20 token will behave.\nButerin had originally proposed an initial token standard in 2015, but Vogelsteller looked at the proposal, changed a few things and proposed ERC-20 to the Ethereum community to initiate a conversation. It was adopted in September 2017 and remains the de facto standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.\nVogelsteller also first introduced the concept of a blockchain-based identity on Ethereum in 2017, known as ERC-725. It gave protocols the ability to create decentralized identity standards on Ethereum. While the Ethereum standard didn't take off like ERC-20 did, projects like Origin Protocol implemented the standard.\nLeaving Ethereum\nBy 2018, Vogelsteller left the Ethereum Foundation to focus on LUKSO and improve on standards that he proposed during his time working on the Ethereum blockchain.\nNow, Vogelsteller has drawn inspiration from the decentralized blockchain identity standard he created for Ethereum, but has turned that into a series of LUKSO Standard Proposals, or LSPs, and the blockchain account at the heart of the ecosystem known as LSP0.\nLSP0, which turns ERC-725 into a smart contract-based profile, tackles the functionality and makes profiles more user friendly on the blockchain. It combines a crypto type wallet, similar to an Ethereum account, with smart-contract storage. In addition to having a regular crypto account attached to these profiles, users can link to any public information they want, like their Twitter account or non-fungible tokens.\nOn LUKSO, users, organizations and teams can create any profile they wish to identify themselves as in Web3; the profile also would act as their blockchain account, making the user experience more seamless.\n‘Way more’ than a wallet\nOn Ethereum, if you hold a regular account, known as an \"externally owned account,\" it’s impossible to add information like the user’s name, age or other information to the public key address, meaning aspects of identity cannot be integrated into the protocol layer.\nAnd while crypto users often enjoy using aliases or being anonymous, having easy ways to identify what a user presents themselves online with their on-chain activity is missing. Vogelsteller believes that universal profiles solve this.\n“It can be a wallet, but it's way more than that,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk. “It is a whole profile. It has a name. It has a picture. It can be managed by multiple devices, by multiple keys, with different levels of permission.”\nThe universal profiles also get \"key managers,\" which can let users add multiple keys to their on-chain account that are assigned or execute different actions. The key manager checks which key can do what on the universal profile and can restrict specific activities of certain devices. In addition, having these multiple keys enables some kind of backup system in the event that a user loses access to a key.\nThere could be benefits for decentralized autonomous organizations, online stores, services or anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer processes required by authorities; organizations are able to store, use and cross-check the public information of a universal profile.\nThe idea of LUKSO is to become a whole ecosystem for creatives. Vogelsteller said LUKSO is “building a whole toolset and ecosystem and marketplace around NFTs using universal profile on the base,” making it easier to identify creatives and their profiles, and their works on the blockchain.\nWhile the hype these days seems to be around “layer 2” scaling tools for Ethereum, Vogesteller argues that LUKSO needed to be its own network.\nNew token standards\nHe argues that the network capacity of these popular layer 2s and Ethereum is full. “Mainnet is full, and it's expensive,\" he said.\nLUKSO isn't the first blockchain to work on identity issues. Ethereum scaling project Polygon recently came out with Polygon ID, which uses zero-knowledge technology that allows users to verify their identities without revealing sensitive information. Other protocols like Ethereum Name Service exist to help connect domain names to users’ wallet addresses, making crypto addresses more identifiable.\n“When you put the profile on the blockchain, everything you do now with your profile is literally happening on the blockchain. So there's a lot more things you can do now,” Vogelsteller said.\nRead more: The Father of the ICO Is All About Identity Now",

    "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) 60% year-to-date surge may be only the first milestone in its upward journey, as miner revenues from transaction fees are rising.\nThe two-year \"Z-score\" for miner revenue from fees, an indicator used to identify periods of high and low transaction fees, has turned positive for the first time since mid-2021, according to data source Glassnode.\nThe positive flip suggests miners' revenue from transaction fees is deviating higher from the two-year mean in a sign of increased network demand. Historically, a return of high fees has coincided with the beginning of major bull runs.\n\"Bolstered by a new demand from Ordinals and Inscriptions, the 2yr Z-Score for miner revenue from fees has turned positive,\" Glassnode's lead analyst, James Check, said in a weekly market update.\n\"Elevated fee pressure is a common precursor to more constructive markets, coincident with new waves of adoption, expressed via increasing demand for blockspace,\" Check added.\nThe Z-score measures the number of standard deviations from the two-year mean fee revenue. The Z-score is usually positive and rising during bull runs and negative during bear runs.\nBitcoin miners solve complex algorithmic puzzles to verify and add new transactions to the blockchain or distributed ledger in return for rewards paid in BTC. In addition, miners also receive a portion of transaction fees.\nFees are a function of transaction size and network volumes (how congested the network is). Transactions are processed in blocks, storing up to 1 megabyte of data. Hence, a sudden spike in activity often leads to network congestion – transactions waiting to get verified. In such situations, miners target transactions with higher fees first. In other words, the more a user offers in fees, the faster his transaction is likely to be verified.\nThe network has seen brisk activity since the launch in January of the Ordinals protocol, which allows users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThe seven-day average of the daily transaction count on the Bitcoin network has increased by 28% this year, reaching a two-year high of over 333,000.\n\"Miners are of course key beneficiaries of this influx, seeing their total revenue spike up to $22.6M/day. This week, miner revenues have lifted to the highest level since June 2022, breaking convincingly above the yearly average,\" Check said, adding that this is typically observed near \"transition points towards a more constructive market.\"",

    "summary": "Storage proofs, a feature that could minimize cross-chain exploits by allowing users to keep their assets on one chain and prove that it's there on a different chain, will go live on Starknet soon.",
    "content": "As new blockchains proliferate, users who want to swap assets between chains are dependent on bridges prone to problems and attacks.\nChainanalysis estimates that bridge attacks accounted for 69% of all cryptocurrency stolen in 2022, with over $2 billion siphoned from buggy cross-chain bridge platforms.\nAs blockchain developers increasingly recognize the problem of vulnerable bridges, some, like the Ethereum layer 2 network Starknet, are turning to “storage proofs” for help.\nStorage proofs are a cryptographic method to allow users to “prove” that certain data, transactions or assets on a blockchain are true or valid, without having to rely on a third party.\n“Today, you hand over money to third parties to transport over a bridge. Anyone can be lurking, waiting to ambush you and steal money,” Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of Starkware, the company behind the Starknet blockchain, explained in a statement. “Storage proofs will let you just press a button and more-or-less teleport liquidity from chain to chain. It’sa dramatic difference.”\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\nAccording to Starknet, they will be the first network to have storage proofs natively integrated, after it goes through a security audit later this year. Currently, Starkware’s Goerli testnet has storage proofs built on it by a team called Herodotus, so project developers can experiment with the new setup.\nStarkware is betting that rising demand for cross-chain transfers will soon bring storage proofs to more platforms.\nHow do Storage proofs work?\nStorage proofs aim to enable “trustless”' cross-chain bridges, using cryptography to eliminate the need for third-party “oracles” to track assets between chains.\nThe method could be particularly useful for tracking assets between Ethereum and its growing community of “layer 2” chains – faster, cheaper networks that operate alongside Ethereum and rely on bridges to communicate with it and between each other.\nWith storage proofs, “You're basically proving mathematically – and using the integrity of math – to assert that you indeed own this asset on Ethereum,” Ben-Sasson told CoinDesk.”You don't need intermediaries, you just need the power of math.”\nBen-Sasson contends that storage proofs can, in some cases, even eliminate the need to transfer assets across different chains. Instead, users could use storage proofs to simply show on one chain that assets exist on another.\nFor instance, say a user has vote-bearing tokens on one blockchain, but a platform’s governance process takes place on another chain. The user can use a storage proof to show their assets on the first chain, and then vote on the second one, without having to move over the assets and pay high gas fees.\nWhy now?\nOne team working on storage proofs is Herodotus, which is focused on bringing them to Ethereum’s layer 2 platforms.\nCryptographic proofs, like storage proofs, can be quite large and complex for computers to verify, making them difficult for space-constrained blockchain networks to handle. Previously, “what really made storage proofs economically unfeasible, is the fact that all the computation had to happen on the blockchain,” said Kacper Koziol, co-founder of Herodotus.\nStarkware turned to zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to address this issue when building its storage proofs, allowing for smaller and more efficient computation.\n“We can simply prove that it was computed in a valid manner and just do the verification of the computation,” Koziol said.\nRead more: Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto",

Based on a report from Boston Consulting Group, the on-chain RWA market is expected to reach between $4 trillion and $16 trillion by 2030.\nWe spend so much time talking about the value of crypto assets like bitcoin and ETH, especially when it applies to financial advisors, but RWA can drive trillions of dollars in adoption, is touted by some of the biggest names in finance (JP Morgan, Citi, Boston Consulting Group, Blackstone) and will be extremely important for advisors to understand.\nYou're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.\nAre Real World Assets like crypto assets?\nMost assets we talk about with regard to blockchain are chain-native assets like bitcoin, ETH, SOL, or UNI. This means they are native to a public blockchain and derive their value from the use or performance of a protocol.\nFor example, bitcoin is an incentive for miners to continue processing blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, while ETH is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network.\nWhen we talk about Real World Assets, we usually mean the integration of using on-chain databases to track the assets, with performance and valuation coming from outside the blockchain.\nFor example, I could have a token that represents equity in a real estate investment, or in a pool that lends money to entrepreneurs in the developing world. While the token is on a blockchain, the assets and payments are in the real world.\nThe Real World Asset tokens are simply representations of assets that are not necessarily blockchain-native, and are NOT volatile assets like we think of in crypto. These RWA tokens, like all cryptographic tokens, are programmable, so we can encode lockup periods, and accredited investor requirements.\nWhy use a blockchain?\nPublic blockchains are simply decentralized databases, good for storing information in an immutable manner. We currently store our data – money, private company equity, loans, financial records – in centralized databases with names like Google, Amazon, Chase, Schwab and your local county title database. Therefore, we have to ask permission every time we want to access that data, and the data from one silo doesn’t easily or natively work with data from another.\nWhen we move that data onto a public blockchain, we can control it using a wallet, a self-custody technology that works hand in hand with blockchains. Once it’s there, we can take advantage of many of the benefits of public blockchains:\nWhy should advisors learn?\nClients are increasingly interested in alternative assets – private credit, real estate, collectibles. Often RWA tokens will represent some of these alternatives.\nWe already see private credit from Maple Finance and Goldfinch, as well as collectibles from Rally Road and 4K. For years, we haven’t seen many options for clients to find income in their portfolio. As interest rates have risen, many of the RWA options offer double-digit returns through interest, without the crypto volatility risk. They can make low-risk loans in markets where Traditional Finance can’t or won’t go, and keep the process efficient.\nAdvisors will need to understand the increased transparency and liquidity. Your clients may have the chance to sell half their real estate tokens after 12 months, and use that money to invest in a pool aimed at providing invoice factoring.\nAdvisors should also have a good knowledge of self-custody, and the efficiencies and security risks inherent to it, so they can help clients invest in these alternatives.\nAdditionally, the increase in activity around RWA will drive more use of the networks. For blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon, this may also trigger higher token prices since the native token – ETH or MATIC – is used to pay for the transactions.\nThe promise of blockchain technology has always been about increasing inclusion and efficiency through public databases. Unlike addressing native crypto assets, which can be volatile and subject to new regulations, Real World Assets on-chain are simply more efficient, transparent ways to denote what people are already comfortable investing in.",

    "content": "On-chain data provider Arkham Intelligence has started a bounty marketplace that will let people buy and sell on-chain cryptocurrency data.\nThe marketplace, dubbed the Arkham Intel Exchange, will feature a native token (ARKM) that is designed to \"deanonymize the blockchain.\"\n\"We believe that deanonymization is destiny in crypto markets, and that the intelligence technology built by Arkham will serve as a foundation for the self-regulation of the crypto economy,\" Arkham said in a tweet.\nThe token will be issued on the Binance Launchpad with 50 million tokens up for sale, which equates to 5% of the total supply. Each user will be able to buy $15,000 worth of ARKM tokens in the sale, which runs from July 11 to July 17.\nThe new platform uses a bounty mechanism that lets users post \"bounties\" for sought-after data. Blockchain researchers and sleuths can then source and provide information in return for the pledged bounty.\nCryptocurrency hacks and exploits broke records last year with billions of dollars worth of digital assets being stolen from cross-chain bridges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and exchanges. Arkham aims to combat the proliferation of crypto hacks by incentivizing on-chain research, although concerns have been raised by several privacy advocates on Twitter.\nArkham has raised over $10 million from two rounds of equity financing with the latest equity round at $150 million, according to Binance's research page. Whilst 5% of token supply is allocated to the token sale, 20% will go to core contributors, 17.5% will go to investors and 17.2% will be put toward the foundation treasury.\nARKM Airdrop\nArkham also plans to distribute ARKM tokens to early adopters of the data intelligence dashboard. The program rewards those who promoted Arkham's growth by sharing referral codes, according to a follow-up tweet. The company said it took a snapshot on July 8 in advance of an airdrop on July 18.",

Eligible projects from pre-seed to Series A, will be able to apply for the program, which includes up to $200,000 in Google Cloud credits, over two years, as well as other technical support, the press release said.\nGoogle, a Web2 powerhouse, has been pushing further into the Web3 world in recent years by helping developers use its technical expertise to build projects. Earlier this month, the Celo Foundation said that it was working with Google Cloud to offer workshops and cloud computing services to developers and Web3 founders building on Celo.\nLast year, BNB Chain, a blockchain closely linked to the crypto exchange Binance, said it was joining with Google Cloud to support the growth of early-stage Web3 and blockchain startups.\n“Google Cloud has been working closely with Web3 companies for several years,” James Tromans, head of Web3 engineering at Google Cloud, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “We are committed to supporting the growth of the Web3 ecosystem, and the expansion of the Google for Startups Cloud Program to the Web3 community reinforces our goal of equipping blockchain developers with the tools they need to succeed.”\nOther program benefits will include early access to Google Cloud’s Web3 products and training on latest cloud-based technologies, according to the press release.\nThe program will give projects access to capital from various partners, including a total of up to $3 million in investments from the Polygon Ventures Ecosystem Fund. Eligible projects could also receive a $1 million grant from each of Google Cloud’s foundation partners: Aptos, Celo, Flow, HBAR Foundation and the Near and Solana foundations, the press release said.\n“The expansion of the Google for Startups Cloud Program for Web3 means giving startups the ability to build on our fully managed, serverless platform, as well as the resources and community to be successful without creating technical debt that slows them down,” Tromans said in the statement.\nThe move comes as Google Cloud’s topmost competitor, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is ramping up its own efforts to increase its market share into the Web3 industry. In January, layer 1 blockchain Ava Labs said it partnered with AWS to accelerate Web3 adoption, and a month after, AWS posted that it's looking to hire Web3 staff for its cloud services.",

    "title": "Avalanche Crippled by Bug Triggered by Unusually High Volume, Engineer Says",
    "summary": "The blockchain, which had been touted for its ability to handle a high volume of transactions, was slowed to a crawl by an unusually high number of transactions.",
    "content": "An Ava Labs engineer gave a rundown of the small code bug that severely crippled the Avalanche blockchain last week.\nIn a Sunday Medium post, blockchain engineer Patrick O'Grady wrote that increased congestion on the network triggered a “non-deterministic bug” related to how the high-throughput, proof-of-stake blockchain keeps track of transactions.\nFunds were never at risk, O'Grady notes, though the high-profile misstep has a valuable lesson for the blockchain industry.\nAvalanche launched in September 2020 with the claim it could process 4,500 transactions per second. It’s backed by prominent cryptocurrency firms including Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Bitmain and Initialized Capital. It also has an academic stamp of approval, having been designed by Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University.\nThe blockchain is usually grouped with other so-called Ethereum killers, or blockchains designed to solve the scalability problems that have plagued the second-largest blockchain since inception. While positioned to steal market share from Ethereum, Avalanche also has been billed as a way to complement and connect – rather than strictly compete – with its forbear.\nAvalanche has three “default chains,” including the so-called “contract chain” that supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine and its Solidity coding language. It’s this chain that was part of this week’s issue.\nYou can read a full accounting of the problem that arose. But in short, in order to boost transaction throughput, Avalanche’s three chains remain separate and distinct from each other, each performing within a set range of transaction-types, up until the moment an asset has to hop over to another chain. That process was placed under an incredible strain, following the launch of a new decentralized money market called Pangolin.\nAn atypical amount of users and volume created an atypical amount of blocks to be processed. This, O’Grady notes, triggered a bug that was creating false cross-chain “mints.” In O’Grady’s words: “This caused some validators to accept some invalid mint transactions, while the rest of the network refused to honor these transactions and stalled the [contract]-chain.”\nImportantly, no double-spends occurred. “The bug did not affect regular transactions, coin transfers, asset transfers, coin destruction, or smart contract invocations. Avalanche never allowed any user to successfully send the same funds to two recipients,” O’Grady wrote.\nA read of the issue was ready just hours after the initial issue, though a fix was harder to come by. Given Avalanche’s decentralized nature, it would be impossible to get all the nodes to collude and rollback problematic transactions.\nInstead, as O’Grady writes, a solution was found through incremental deployment of a patch – basically the way any software is updated.\nBlockchains are complex things, built by human beings, but run by machines. An issue that was small enough to bypass during an initial inspection can snowball as a network grows. In Avalanche’s case, the bug didn’t bring down the network but it did pour ice water over some of the boasts made about the network’s ability to handle high-throughput prior to launch.\nAVAX, the blockchain’s token, is trading hands at around $41.20, down from $53 on Feb. 11 when the problem occurred.",

    "title": "Time Is Running Out to Win the Blockchain Race",
    "summary": "Tech and financial services companies might think they have plenty of time to develop a \"blockchain strategy.\" If history is a guide, they don't, says EY's blockchain leader.",
    "content": "History is full of companies that missed out on big technological changes. Many of them thought they were carefully timing their participation in the market, but I believe they may have been looking at the wrong measures of adoption and consequently made the wrong decisions. That pattern is about to repeat itself with blockchain. The issue here is that when it comes to technology, the battle over standards and market leadership is usually decided before mass adoption.\nThe result is that by the time most companies notice that the market is entering a mass-adoption phase, it’s too late to change the course of the market. The market for personal computers arguably started in 1977. A decade later, in 1987, less than 15% of all American households had a personal computer, but by then, Microsoft Windows was the market leader with more than half the market. (Great perspective from Asymco.com here and here and here.)\nThe pattern repeated itself in the smartphone category. Nokia can be said to have kicked off the market with the Symbian ecosystem in 2000. Email-focused smartphones followed in 2003 and then touch-based smartphones in 2007. By 2011, even though adoption was still less than about 20% of the market, we already had the same two market leaders we know today.\nThe pattern appears to have largely repeated itself in the world of cloud computing and networking systems. Even though both markets are largely based on open-source technologies and well-understood published standards, they remain dominated by the original leaders, even after decades of determined and big spending competition. The market leader in networks has a 50% share, and the market leader in cloud has a 32% share.\nAnd so there is a lesson here for the world of blockchain: Time is running out. That’s true for alternative blockchains, for legacy players, for everyone who isn’t already knee-deep in this business to become a serious player. Depending on the starting point you select (Bitcoin in 2009 or Ethereum in 2015), we are seven to 12 years into this market development. Estimates vary, but the more reliable ones point to between 8% and 10% of all Americans already own some cryptocurrency. The window to create a leadership position seems to close around 10-12 years after a market is created, and so that time is near, if it hasn’t already arrived.\nJust how close we are to the end of the game can be hard to discern in the day-to-day fog of competitive warfare. Between 1985 and 1990, you wouldn't have been in bad company if you had picked up a Commodore Amiga (as I did) or an Atari ST. In the mid-2000s, you were in similarly good company if you eschewed complicated touch screens for the reliability of a smartphone with keys.\nNot only would you have been in good company for choosing different smartphones or PCs, you would have also been right in pointing out the enormous flaws in the market leaders. A black and white PC in 1985? Only 640 kilobytes of memory? The same kinds of absurdities can be found in the world of blockchain. The carbon footprint for Bitcoin and the transaction gas fees (the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum) can only be described as obscene.\nThese problems did not destroy their ecosystems, however. They got fixed, often imperfectly and with much grumbling, and people moved on. When PCs with extended memory arrived, the solution was criticized as a clumsy workaround. People bought them in huge numbers anyway. Expect roughly the same reception to any “solution” to Bitcoin’s carbon footprint.\nI believe the dominant players in the world of blockchain are clearly visible now as well. Bitcoin represents a bigger market capitalization than every other blockchain combined and appears to be on track to become the preferred digital store of value. Likewise, Ethereum has more developers than every other blockchain combined, and is similarly on track to becoming the preferred economic infrastructure for the next generation of developers. At the same time, companies like Aave, Binance, Coinbase and Compound Labs are busy staking out the high ground in this ecosystem around specific value propositions.\nI’ve spent five years at EY doing everything I can to make sure that we don’t just participate in this market, but that we lead it. I don’t think I will know if we succeeded for another decade, but I am sure that the critical time is now, and I find myself struggling at times to communicate to others my intense sense of urgency in a market that many think is just in its infant stages.\nIf there is one final reason to act with urgency, it’s not just that the window for market leadership is closing. It is also unlikely to reopen. There were better operating systems back in 1987 than the market leaders, and that was also true in 2000, 2010 and 2020.\nThe most astonishing aspect about market leadership in technology is how little it depends on the technology itself. There is always something better out there. The strength of the platform may have started in the technology, but in the end, it is much more driven by the total investment, the installed base and the developer community.\nIn the next year or two, you can expect many technology and financial services companies to explain their plans to enter the blockchain market. In nearly every case, they will cite the low penetration of the technology in their industry or market as evidence that it’s “early days yet” and they have “plenty of time” to formulate their strategy and leverage their legacy market position. It isn’t. They don’t.\nThe views reflected in this article are the view of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.",

    "summary": "China's BSN could be met with geopolitical resistance as it continues to extend its global reach.",
    "content": "The Takeaway:\nA state-backed blockchain infrastructure project from China aims to be the dominant internet services provider for decentralized applications (dapps). Its first-mover advantage is significant, as are the geopolitical risks.\nThe project, called the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), is expanding globally as U.S.-China relations become increasingly tense. BSN is a Chinese state-sanctioned blockchain project, but few may realize the network is supported by U.S. technology companies.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google are among the major cloud service providers for BSN’s overseas data centers.\nThis arrangement is notable, given the U.S. government’s hawkishness on Chinese technology. The Trump administration is considering a ban on Chinese social media app Tik Tok, Congress approved $1 billion for rural telecom carriers to ditch services from Huawei and the U.S. Commerce Department restricted semiconductor companies from providing chips to Huawei.\nAt Wednesday's House antitrust hearing, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg painted the China-U.S. tech competition as a zero-sum game. According to Zuckerberg, “China is building its own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.”\nThis charged environment could potentially spell trouble for BSN. “China tries to grab the lead in blockchain and dominate this domain and that may end up putting this BSN project further into the spotlight of the U.S.-China tech competition,” said Paul Triolo, practice head of geotechnology at Eurasia Group.\n“This would be the perception in places like Washington,” he added.\nU.S.-China technology competition has been ongoing for decades, but the focus is shifting from search engines and social media to more fundamental levels of technology like telecom equipment provided by Huawei, Triolo said.\nTension between the U.S. and China reached fever pitch earlier this month as the U.S. shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston and China took over the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in retaliation. In a recent speech, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed U.S.-China engagement as a failure.\nIt’s unclear whether these tensions will calm in the near future, even if a new U.S. president is elected.\n“Even if we get a new administration in the U.S., for example, under [former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joseph] Biden, there is still going to be a lot of scrutiny on China from the technology front,” Triolo said.\nThere is a real risk that technology that doesn’t present a national security risk will nonetheless be banned because of politics, said Graham Webster, China digital economy fellow at New America, a think-tank with a focus on public policy issues.\nAmazon, Google and Microsoft did not return requests for comment by press time.\nContainment\nOne way to limit Chinese tech companies from growing and developing global services is to pressure their suppliers to sever ties with them.\nThe U.S. prohibited Huawei’s major provider – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) – from using American tools to make chips if it produces any product for Huawei. The Chinese company denounced the move as a “pernicious decision.”\nBSN could potentially end up in a similar situation, given the prominence of American firms as its overseas data center hosts.\nThe Chinese network does not build or own any of the data centers where it runs its technical infrastructure; 90% of BSN’s domestic data centers are provided by the telecom company China Mobile. Most overseas data centers will be provided by Amazon’s AWS, given the scope of the cloud services provider’s operations across the globe, according to BSN.\nBSN pays these cloud services providers to use their servers and integrates the servers with their software.\nRead more: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption\nThe network has two data centers hosted by AWS in China. It also uses a few global data centers built on Microsoft’s cloud computing arm and Google Cloud Platform. BSN has one data center from Google Cloud based in Tokyo, one from Microsoft in Johannesburg and two from AWS in Paris and California.\nDapp developers can more quickly and easily access services from BSN if they use a data center that is physically close to them. That's why overseas data centers are crucial in terms of providing internet services for the global blockchain community.\n“If I were the Chinese company, I would be careful about setting up a system that really depends on continued services in the U.S.,” Webster said. “Anybody who wants to use the global version of this Chinese network should take into account the risk that a data center in the U.S. could get taken off the network because of geopolitics.”\nOne motivation for curbing Chinese tech companies’ global expansion is data security concerns.\nBlockchain technology clearly provides a structurally unusual level of security and integrity, but there is a battle going on over data localization and cloud services, said James Mulnevon, director of intelligence integration at SOS International, a Washington, D.C.-based defense and intelligence company that supports U.S. government agencies.\n“The world is clearly becoming a ‘splinternet’ with national boundaries and domestic regulations overturning the previous ‘techno globalism’ motif,” Mulnevon said.\nU.S. cloud providers offer services to a wide range of clients and it is hard to tell what specific cyber security concerns would exist if they allow Chinese companies to use their services, Webster said.\nNo immediate threat\nSo far, BSN’s global expansion has not met with challenges from U.S. regulators, perhaps because it is relatively new. Or maybe it’s just that few Washington lawmakers can actually make sense of it.\n“Part of the reason that BSN has not met with challenges from the U.S. policy makers as the other emerging technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence is that blockchain technology is not well understood,” Triolo said.\nThe U.S. government is considering restricting Chinese cloud services companies from operating in the U.S., but has yet to address the question of U.S. companies hosting applications that have a China connection.\nLast May, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) denied China Mobile’s application to operate telecommunications services in the U.S. This could mean Chinese businesses trying to build cloud-based networks in the U.S. need to be aware of the geopolitical risk, said James Mulvenon, director of Intelligence Integration at SOS International, a DC-based defense and intelligence firm.\n“I would be wary about big investments in these kinds of transnational cloud networks because regulators seem very grumpy about them right now,” Mulvenon said.\nRead more: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision\nLawmakers who do have concerns might be reassured by the fact that even if the Chinese government does ask for data from BSN nodes hosted overseas, it may not be able to get it.\nThe Chinese government has a very expansive view of extraterritoriality, Mulnevon said.\n“The Chinese government certainly believes that Chinese companies operating abroad (even when they are incorporated abroad) are subject to Chinese law,” he said.\nTheoretically, the Chinese government would solicit data from a Chinese company like the one behind BSN regardless of where it is run, meaning it could ask for data stored in the network’s overseas data centers. However, Red Date, the tech firm that architected BSN’s technical framework, has claimed the network does not have access to user data, due to its technical structure.\nRed Date CEO Yifan He previously told CoinDesk that BSN’s technical framework fully protects its users’ data privacy and functions like an adapter that better connects developers with data centers where they can run nodes and build applications. He even invited skeptics to examine the network’s code for themselves.\nThe China connection\nThe BSN Development Association is led by the State Information Center of China (SIC), a public institution under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning committee in China. State-owned tech conglomerates China Mobile and China UnionPay are also deeply involved in building the network.\nIt is certainly rare to get a government affiliate to endorse and lead the effort for a large-scale blockchain infrastructure, and for two of the largest Chinese tech giants to support the network. However, unlike China’s national digital currency, higher-level government agencies such as the Chinese central bank and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (MIIT) do not appear to be involved in BSN yet.\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the Chinese government and BSN is not clear. But given BSN’s state connection, its reliance on major U.S. cloud services providers could be a point of contention on the Chinese side as well.\n“No foreign firms sit on any BSN leadership committees. As stated in official documents, Beijing intends for BSN to be a ‘global infrastructure network autonomously innovated by Chinese entities,’” according to a May report from Eurasia Group.",

    "content": "Safety and data protection are major concerns when it comes to the growing use of commercial drones, but blockchain could provide a working solution, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT).\nThe tech report says commercial usage of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is becoming increasingly prevalent in today's society in applications ranging from consumer deliveries to emergency response to transporting medicines and organs for transplant.\nHowever, logistics relating to the safe management of swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as well as air traffic management and reliable operations near \"high-risk\" areas such as crowded areas or airports are proving problematic. That's where the tracing and tracking of individual drones via the blockchain can make a difference, the DoT says.\n\"Blockchain technology is being looked on to deliver a framework that can be used by stakeholders in the commercial drone industry, as it can ensure security and provide for identity management as well as providing a supporting role in aircraft traffic management, UAS conflict management and flight authorization,\" according to the report.\nSee also: Drone Data Service to Create Blockchain-Based Black Box\nIn certain instances, blockchain technology could be used to address particular trust and integrity issues when it comes to drone systems, too. Flight data recorders (black boxes), for example, provide data to help investigators understand what a UAV was doing before an incident occurred, similar to those installed in all aircraft in the airline industry.\nA blockchain-based flight recorder, or \"black box,\" could enable law enforcement to be proactive in monitoring drones' flight patterns in real time, providing the information to help navigate around a perceived threat or incident. It could also help industry regulators track and review drone flight data to make smarter decisions about the safest route to a particular destination.\nThe Federal Aviation Industry (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have begun leading an industrywide standardization effort for drone traffic management. Since 2018 Boeing has been developing a traffic management system for all drones that use artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, the report notes.\nNASA has also proposed a blockchain-based framework for the FAA-mandated automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) system enabling aircraft privacy while guarding against spoofing, denial of service, and other security risk factors.\nSee also: IBM Patents Blockchain to Stop Drones From Stealing Packages\nWhile drones show \"much promise\" across various industries, their automated nature makes trust \"a significant issue.\" Additionally, the integration of AI into UAS \"may require regulations ... beyond industry best practices,\" according to the report.\n\"Blockchains might be part of successful and effective regulation, ensuring that machines operate in a trustworthy manner through the use of monitoring via a blockchain-protected recording of their activity, the DoT concluded.",

    "title": "The Future of Everything Is Free",
    "summary": "Blockchains are about to make a lot of things effectively free, and as a result they will transform how business and finance are done, says our columnist.",
    "content": "Lately, free stuff has gotten a bad rap. It’s not uncommon to hear people say things like, “If you’re not paying, you’re the product not the customer.” It’s clever and thought provoking, but mostly intended as a put-down to the rubes getting their social media for free. (That includes me). But maybe it’s time to rehabilitate the idea of free stuff being a good thing, because nearly everything will be free soon.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nI can still remember when, as a child, long-distance phone calls to family members on different continents was a special occasion for holidays and birthdays. Off-shoring information technology and outsourcing took off in the 1990s, in large part because telecommunications became so cheap as to be, for all practical purposes, free. Once phone calls and data communications were basically free, why not put developers and calls centers anywhere you can find great skills and low costs? Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty as a result.\nAre phone calls really and truly free? They are not. Nor is bandwidth or CPU power, but in a very important sense, the marginal cost of additional bandwidth or compute power is really free. Once you have paid for a hard drive, for example, using space on it that was empty, really costs nothing at the margin. And in many cases, marginal costs have a much bigger impact on our behavior and our opportunities, than averages or up-front costs.\nGPS is another good example of the power of truly free stuff. Because using GPS is free of charge to everyone worldwide, entire industries have been built upon this technology – there are thought to be around 8 billion GPS-enabled devices worldwide driving an economic impact of over $250 billion annually.\nGPS, like social media, is also a powerful illustration of the idea that a completely free is much better than nearly free. Nearly-free things still come with transaction costs and impose cognitive load on users to figure them out, as well as operational complexity in getting payment. Nearly every user of an online social media service could afford to pay $1 annually for the service, yet charging even that small amount would result in a huge reduction in users.\nBlockchains exist because software, CPU cycles, bandwidth and storage have at the margin, become so cheap as to be effectively free. This sounds counterintuitive when people are spending hundreds of millions on mining rigs, but those are an extreme and specialized case. Blockchains simply could not have existed in the 1960s and 1970s when my mother was programming mainframes and my father was using them for nuclear physics. Computing time was expensive and you booked it in advance.\nBlockchains are an enormous waste of computing power by any reasonable historical standard. Everyone checking everyone else’s work? Insane, unless what has become free is computing power while what is valuable is trustworthy transaction processing.\nWhen the marginal cost of computing power and connectivity approach zero, a lot of amazing things start to happen: mobile maps with turn-by-turn directions, always-available encyclopedias and phone calls that turn into all-day video hang-outs with friends and family. In competitive markets, the price of products gradually converges with the marginal cost of making them, which means that companies must constantly add more value to stay ahead of what will soon be entirely free.\nSee also: Paul Brody - Public Blockchains Are Set to Reshape Global Commerce\nIn the last year, the U.S. and quite a few other countries have embarked upon a whole new experiment in the real economy by going so far as to make money, in many respects, free. In addition to air-dropping (to borrow a blockchain term) trillions of dollars on the American public in the first COVID-19 stimulus package, interest rates remain at or near-zero in much of the world and central banks are directly injecting liquidity in the capital markets. This seems to have worked out very well.\nThe COVID-19 airdrop was our first-ever real experiment with what might be called trickle-up economics. It was a spectacular success. Some economists estimate that 18 million people in U.S. were saved from poverty by this package. Not everyone is on board, including many people in the blockchain community who believe free money will lead to high inflation. This did not happen in 2008 and it isn’t going to happen in 2020.\nI believe scarcity should be for collectible kicks, not health care, food and education. I believe the greatest achievement blockchains have to offer to make even more things effectively free. Instead, I think the blockchain community should embrace the possibility of free capital as enthusiastically as it has embraced free software and air-drop payments.\nBlockchains are about to make a lot of things that have historically been very expensive effectively free, and as a result they will transform how business and finance are done.\nInitial public offerings are a good example. IPOs are expensive, ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to hundreds of millions when the full cost of going to market is totaled. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) did much the same thing, for a fraction of the cost. Some of these costs were related to what might be politely described as regulatory arbitrage, but much of the savings also came from bypassing the very complex system that currently controls access to public markets.\nSee also: Paul Brody - Why CBDCs Are Really Game-Changing\nThere are a few other things that blockchains are about to make much cheaper, perhaps closer to free than ever before. One of them is cross-enterprise system integration. Historically, tying together your enterprise systems with those of a supplier or partner is a project that runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. On a blockchain, using standardized smart contracts, it will be in the tens of dollars. This will make adding new suppliers or expanding globally a remarkably simple process.\nFree capital is also transforming the world of blockchains. When the risk-free rate of return falls to zero, the attraction of taking risk suddenly goes up as investors pursue returns. Projects with more risk are now affordable, indeed, they are aggressively being pursued by investors. You can also use more capital in your projects. This is going to help speed along key technologies like optimistic rollups (a type of Ethereum scaling solution).\nOptimistic rollups also benefit from near-zero capital costs and cut blockchain transaction processing costs. They tie up your capital for a week or so while the different participants verify their end of the transaction, but the lower the cost of capital the bigger the benefit of using this technology. This allows for far more transactions at a much lower cost on the Ethereum blockchain. If capital was expensive, embracing this technology would be a tough choice.\nIf you want to think about the future of your business, imagine what it will be like if a critical part of your business was suddenly free. And don’t stop yourself from ever thinking there are some things that cannot or will not one day be entirely free. Free labor? How would you describe the work of online reviewers? Free air travel? Have you flown with some discount airlines? The fare is nearly free because the entire trip is basically a guided tour through a series of shopping malls. I have solar panels on the roof of my house. The marginal cost of electricity on a sunny day for me is zero. Free might just work out for everyone.\nSo go ahead, think about what your business will be like if everything is free (or very close to free). And think about what your company will be like if you are the first to offer your product for free.",

Over the past year researchers have blasted blockchain and internet-backed voting platforms as insecure and prone to bugs, prompting some election authorities to pull out of plans to use them.\nStaffers did not share researchers' fears.\n“Although some have raised concerns about the use of online systems for voting, those concerns are more specific to secret ballot elections than they are to public Senate votes,” they wrote.\nRead more: 11 Lawmakers Urge US Treasury to Consider Blockchain for COVID-19 Relief\nThat’s not to say a Senate blockchain would be a completely safe blockchain. The staffers were acutely fearful of a “51 percent attack” scenario in which a malicious actor seized the power of consensus by taking majority control of the voting chain.\nAssuming one could prevent a 51 percent attack and also shore up any bugs, cryptographic or otherwise, the staffers were bullish on blockchain voting in the Senate. They wrote that it adds transparency and lowers the risk of incorrect vote tallies.\n“With its encrypted distributed ledger, blockchain can both transmit a vote securely and also verify the correct vote,” the memo said.",

    "title": "Swiss Government Makes Moves to Encourage Crypto Businesses",
    "summary": "The Swiss government is making key legislative changes to financial laws to improve legal conditions for blockchain businesses.",
    "content": "The Swiss government is encouraging blockchain startups to set up shop with new laws that lower legal barriers to such businesses while leaving favorable tax laws untouched.\nThe National Council, Switzerland’s equivalent of the U.S. House of Representatives, unanimously passed a legislative package changing about a dozen financial laws on June 17. The changes, proposed by the Swiss Federal Council, are intended to remove legal barriers to applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.\nOn June 19, the Federal Council acknowledged a report prepared by the Federal Department of Finance that concluded there was no need to make special amendments to existing tax laws with regard to blockchain. The report was commissioned by the Federal Council in 2018 when the government decided to examine existing tax laws and assess any need for amendments.\nSwitzerland has long been a blockchain startup magnet. The city of Zug, in particular, was a popular location for token-funded projects during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, earning it the nickname Crypto Valley.\nWhile ICOs have faded, Switzerland’s enthusiasm for blockchain technology has not.\n“It’s known that Switzerland is very much trying to encourage blockchain business. It’s a political objective,” said Rolf H. Weber, professor of financial market law and chair of the working group for regulatory issues at the Swiss Blockchain Federation.\nThe changes were largely based on a Federal Council proposal filed last year, and will now be passed on to the upper chamber, the Council of States, for a final vote this fall.\nThrough communications specialist Joel Weibel, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration said Swiss laws must guarantee legal certainty and the openness of authorities to new technologies.\nThe new laws\nAs it exists now, Swiss law is cumbersome, particularly when applied to the transfer of security tokens, Weber said. All transfers must be done in writing, like the traditional exchange of a bond. But the new legislation will make the transfer of security tokens easier, Weber said.\n“In my opinion, the most important changes are in company and securities law,” Weber said.\nUnlike any digital asset before it, a token has the same characteristics of a piece of paper, or written agreement, said Christian Meisser, CEO of Swiss blockchain legal consultancy fim LEXR AG.\n“Why not give it the same properties as a piece of paper? If you transfer a token, you also transfer any right of ownership linked to it. That is the revolutionary aspect of the new Swiss law,” Meisser said.\nAccording to Weber, as soon as the law is enacted, owners will be able to freely register and transfer their security tokens within distributed electronic ledgers, and providers of ledger technology will be allowed to offer those services without legal ramifications.\nNew provisions made to bankruptcy laws would allow owners to appeal to authorities to reclaim their assets.\n“This is not possible today with digital tokens because with tokens you don't have proof of ownership. It’s similar to cash. You can never extract or withdraw cash from a bankrupt estate,” Weber said.\nThe new laws also contain eight provisions describing how providers of digital ledger technology and trading platforms can obtain a license from the financial authority.\nEven though the legislative package passed without opposition, according to Meisser, left-leaning politicians raised concerns the new laws failed to address the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, a process that requires large quantities of energy and resources.\nThe broader framework\nInstead of proactively regulating new financial instruments, lawmakers in Switzerland typically try first to apply existing laws, said Luzius Meisser, founder of Bitcoin Association Switzerland\n“Once that doesn't work anymore, then we create a new law,” Luzius said.\nIn his view, Switzerland does not look at blockchain technology or crypto assets as unique entities, but as extensions of existing instruments.\nAccording to Weber, the new laws would change the broader framework to improve conditions for owners and providers of crypto assets.\n“You may say this is a ‘blockchain law’ because all changes relate to blockchain business models. But in contrast to a few other countries like Malta or the Principality of Liechtenstein, Switzerland is not going to implement blockchain law in a narrow sense,” Weber said.\nReducing taxes\nTwo days after the National Council vote on June 17, the Federal Council decided prevailing Swiss tax laws will not need to be amended to include special considerations for blockchain technology.\nAs things stand in Switzerland, bitcoin mining is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) while some security tokens are exempt from withholding tax, and there is no capital gains tax on investments.\nAccording to Luzius, Switzerland has a withholding tax placed on dividends earned from traditional securities such as bonds or shares. Weibel from the tax authority said this tax also applies to “shares in tokenized form” to ensure all investors are treated equally.\n“But current Swiss law also allows participation in the company’s profit without levying the withholding tax on the income related to this profit. This option is now also available in the attractive form of tradable participation tokens,” Weibel said.\nIn simpler terms, there are certain special taxes in Switzerland that do not apply to security tokens but apply for securities, Luzius said.\n“Lawmakers say they are okay with not filling this gap for now because the market for security tokens is still very small,” Luzius said.\nTo encourage earnings through investment, the country does not tax capital gains on any investment, and the Department of Finance report assessing the need for new tax laws concluded there was no need to start with crypto.\n“This is very good news for the crypto space because it means less taxes at least for now,” Luzius said.",

    "content": "Bitcoin traders urged caution as prices for the cryptocurrency slid toward $50,000 for the first time in two weeks while the options market braced for volatility ahead of a record $6 billion contract expiration Friday.\n“This is a time to make sure that you have some dry powder and are not overextended,” Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower, said in an emailed comment. “It seems as though buyers are stepping back, and instead of buying the dip are simply waiting on the sidelines to see what happens.”\nRead More: Bitcoin Traders Brace for Record $6B in Options to Expire Friday\nThe largest cryptocurrency was unchanged to slightly lower Thursday, at around $52,100 as of 19:19 UTC (3:19 p.m. ET). Earlier, prices slid as low as $50,360. Bitcoin hasn’t traded below $50,000 since March 8, well off its all-time high above $61,000.\nU.S. stocks were barely higher Thursday, churning below record highs, while Asian and European markets were lower. Some of that weakness could be hampering risk-taking spirits among bitcoin traders.\nThe U.S. dollar has strengthened recently to new highs in foreign exchange markets. Bitcoin is negatively correlated with the greenback, which means they often trade in opposite directions.\nThere’s also the monthly expiration looming Friday in the bitcoin options market. Analysts have warned the “max pain” point – where buyers have the most to lose and sellers the most to gain – would occur if the price plunged to around $44,000. The risk is considered remote but plausible.\n“We're currently looking for support in the range between $50,000 and $48,000,” Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk. “Any concrete signs of recovery are likely to show up after the options expiry on Friday.”\nIn the meantime, CoinDesk reported Thursday that blockchain data might be turning more bullish: An unusually large number of bitcoins are being withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and going to an illiquid status – possibly an indication they’re being taken down by long-term holders who are unlikely to sell their tokens anytime soon.\nRead More: Long-Term Holders Keep Accumulating Bitcoin Amid Latest Sell-Off: Blockchain Data\n“Support only holds as long as there are a multitude of large buyers willing to step in if prices decline,” Steinglass said. “We’ll all have to wait and see.”\nEther faces near-term pressure\nEther (ETH) was down on Thursday, trading around $1,605.95 and slipping 1.86% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).\nA key support level to watch is in the range of $1,500 and $1,600, according to OKEx Insights’ Naseer. If that support fails, a deeper sell-off could ensue.\nEther “has been unable to bounce back in the absence of a strong signal from bitcoin,” he said.\nA key factor that analysts are dissecting in the ether market is the role of dollar-pegged stablecoins in the fast-growing digital economy, much of which is centered on the Ethereum blockchain.\nRead more: Ethereum’s Transition Could Be Months, Not Years, Away\nAccording to Messari research analyst Ryan Watkins, Ethereum is at risk of becoming “dollarized” because of the prevalence of stablecoins including tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC).\n“Ethereum has dollarized, and the dollar is ultimately controlled by the Federal Reserve, clouding dreams of an independent monetary system,” he wrote.\nThe market has taken notice, and one solution might be so-called non-pegged stablecoins. By sacrificing a “fixed exchange rate,” one of three points in a triangular currency model known as “the impossible trinity,” a new type of stablecoin might be able to achieve an independent monetary policy.\nWatkins explained the concept in this tweet thread.\nOther markets\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in red Thursday.

Plus, Twitter’s staff are amping up reliance and machine-learning tools to help identify non-authentic user behavior, aka propaganda.\n“I appreciate the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity,” he said. “Pseudonymity is built identity. … We want to protect that,” he said.\nThe appearance comes after the now-infamous Twitter hack of July 2020, when the platform suffered its most prominent attack in years. A 17-year-old hacker is still being tried for multiple fraud charges in Florida for infiltrating some of the world’s most prominent accounts and soliciting bitcoin payments.\n\"Security is not anything that can ever be perfected, it’s a constant race,\" Dorsey said. “The more we’re giving the individual the keys, the safer we’re going to be.”",

    "summary": "Find out why some of the world's largest companies are turning to these specific blockchains to revolutionize their businesses.",
    "content": "An \"enterprise blockchain\" is a type of permissioned blockchain that can be used to streamline business processes at scale, such as track supply chain goods or settle global payments.\nCorporations believe this type suits their needs better than a public blockchain network, such as Bitcoin, because the visibility of their data can be restricted to a select group of people.\nWhile there are different types of blockchains, they are all essentially digital records of financial transactions and data that are shared among a group of entities. They also use cryptography to make it difficult for malicious agents to manipulate the history of previous transactions.\nFacebook, IBM, JPMorgan, Walmart and Intel are just some of the big companies exploring enterprise blockchains and how this modern technology can be leveraged to improve transparency and optimize existing business operations.\nEnterprise blockchain FAQs\nHow is an enterprise blockchain different from other types?\nA vast majority of enterprise blockchains are \"permissioned blockchains,\" meaning companies have direct control over them. For instance, they can block transactions that do not comply with their rules, or if law enforcement asks them to do so.\nThis is one of the biggest differences that sets permissioned ledgers aside from public ones like the one Bitcoin is built on. Public blockchains exist outside the control of any one company or government and are resistant to censorship. This is why bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been used successfully to circumvent international sanctions and even combat domestic cases of extortion.\nWhile companies aren't keen on this aspect, many have determined that they might be able to use the underlying technology to revolutionize payments and other areas of business.\nSome of the main characteristics of enterprise blockchains include:\nWhat are the types of enterprise blockchains?\nEnterprise blockchains are generally permissioned, falling into two categories:\nEnterprises could also conceivably use a public ledger system like Bitcoin, but most choose not to. Microsoft's identity project ION is an outlier for doing so.\nWould my company benefit from using one?\nBlockchains can be useful, but not every company needs one. CoinDesk has put together a chart with some of the questions you might want to ask and answer before proceeding down the rabbit hole.\nComputer science researchers put forth a similar, more formal paper for determining which scenarios blockchains are best suited for.\nHow popular are they?\nA global survey of companies conducted by Deloitte in 2019 found 53% of respondents said that \"blockchain technology has become a critical priority for their organizations in 2019,\" a 10% increase over 2018.\nWhat are some crypto startups and organizations working on enterprise blockchains?\nWhat are some prominent companies exploring enterprise blockchains?\nBig companies with household name recognition are exploring this type of distributed ledger technology and don't want to be left behind.\nNotable companies exploring them include:\nWhere are companies in terms of adopting enterprise blockchains?\nMany companies have been exploring the advantages of enterprise blockchains for years. But the technology is far from taking over the world just yet. Most companies are still in the testing phase and haven't rolled out production-ready versions. Whereas before companies working on these solutions have mostly been rivals, recently many of these same companies have been partnering with existing blockchain projects.",

    "summary": "Casper is an Ethereum competitor that aims to launch in the first quarter of 2021.",
    "content": "China’s Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) announced that it has integrated with the Casper Network, a layer-1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that forked from Ethereum.\nThe integration means the Casper Network will be available to developers on BSN after its mainnet launch in the first quarter of 2021, according to the firm’s press statement, which was shared with CoinDesk.\nThe partnership is part of BSN’s efforts to become a global blockchain infrastructure services provider. The state-backed project aims to offer cloud services and a standardized development environment, where decentralized applications (dapp) developers across various blockchain networks can build or run their dapps on the same platform.\nBSN was co-founded by Chinese state-owned telecom giant China Mobile, UnionPay and IT startup Red Date in April 2020. It has integrated some of the most popular blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Cosmos and Palkdot. BSN claimed its inclusive platform can help dapp developers reduce operational costs and improve flexibility with regulatory oversight.\n\"Casper is the first fully decentralized, scalable and highly secure proof-of-stake blockchain,” Mrinal Manohar, CEO and co-founder of CasperLabs, said in the statement. “Via our close partnership with BSN, we look forward to helping promote the continued adoption of this important public technology across global markets.\"\nAs one of many possible Ethereum competitors, the Casper Network hopes to improve security without sacrificing the scalability as a PoS network. Advised by Ethereum Foundation’s researcher Vlad Zamfir, the Casper Network has raised $14.5 million via a Series A funding round in 2019 from investors such as Arrington XRP Capital and Hashkey Capital.\nCasperLabs partnered with Singapore-based exchange BitMax to launch a token sale for retail investors in March 2020. The exchange predominantly offers trading services to traders in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia and India.\n“We are confident in both the Red Date and CasperLabs teams to spearhead the adoption of the Casper network and blockchain technology in China,” Omer Ozden, Chairman of RockTree Capital, which invested in CasperLabs’ Series A round, said in the statement.",

    "content": "Chinese blockchain infrastructure provider Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) has integrated cross-chain protocol Polkadot, cloud computing startup Oasis and China-based public chain project Bityuan into its network.\nThe additions are part of BSN’s effort to bring a variety of blockchain projects under one standardized development environment within its own technical framework. It also aims to provide data processing and storage services to the in-network projects.\nThis is just the latest sign of China’s ambitions to become a blockchain superpower, by creating an infrastructure that is used by projects and developers world-wide. The state-sanctioned network, which aims to be the internet of blockchains, launched the global version of its network in July, allowing developers to access public chains to build or operate their decentralized applications (dapps). BSN later announced it would make 24 public chains permissioned and add them to its domestic version in China by the end of November.\n“We anticipate Polkadot to be used by developers across the world to build and run innovative protocols and applications,” said Björn Wagner, co-founder of Parity Technologies behind Polkadot. “The BSN integration will support developers on that journey by enabling them to seamlessly connect to the public chain.”\nWhile Polkadot helps connect both public and permissioned chains with each other on its protocol, it is set to join BSN’s Open Permissioned Blockchain Initiative to provide blockchain services in the Chinese market where decentralized public chains are heavily scrutinized by its government.\nBSN will integrate Substrate, which is a native framework used to create dapps in the Polkadot ecosystem, as a standard permissioned framework for developers to deploy and operate private chains on BSN, Yifan He, executive director of BSN Development Association, told CoinDesk.\nDapp developers on BSN will also have access to the Oasis Network, which claims to help developers build private and scalable decentralized finance applications.\n“The Oasis Network’s privacy features can also create a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data that allows users to take control of their data and earn rewards for staking it,” Jernej Kos, director at the Oasis Foundation, said in a statement.\nFounded in 2018, Oasis has raised over $46 million via a private token sale in the same year. Among its backers are its lead investor Andreessen Horowitz’s A16z crypto fund, Binance, Polychain, Pantera and Electric Capital.\nBSN will also be integrating Bityuan, which aims to provide blockchain solutions to companies in China.\n“I am seeing commercial use cases built on the Bityuan framework are surging in China recently,” He said. “I believe with this integration BSN will get developers around the world to be excited about building dapps that are enterprise-based and commercial oriented.”",

He served on the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, before rotating off at the end of 2020.\n\"Right now it's clear it's a store of value,\" Kaplan said of the largest cryptocurrency. \"It obviously moves a lot in value, which could keep it from spreading too far as a medium of exchange and wide adoption, but that can change.\"\nLately, that movement has been up, in dollar terms. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has increased eightfold over the past year, to about $61,400 as of press time, for a market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion.\nA growing number of big investors, including legendary hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller, have said bitcoin might serve as an effective hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.\nAn alternative perspective would be that the U.S. dollar has lost nearly 90% of its value, when expressed in bitcoin terms.",

Since 2018, authorities have offered immigration incentives to blockchain job seekers, launched a blockchain trade finance platform and brokered industry ties.\nThose efforts appear to be paying off in more ways than one. Hong Kong had four times higher than average demand for blockchain professionals in a 2019 LinkedIn report, which ranked blockchain as the region’s top rising skill set.\nDiversity in blockchain focus\nHong Kong’s heightened interest in blockchain jobs and firms spreads across the industry, the Treasury report shows.\nOf 2019’s newcomer blockchain firms, 45% were enterprise blockchain companies, 27% built digital asset trading platforms, 14% were digital asset custodians and 9% focused on trade finance settlement.\nAn additional 5% were “exploring the area of security tokens” according to the Treasury report. That cautious wording may be a function of security tokens’ nascent regulatory status. Hong Kong’s financial regulator issued guidance on security tokens in March 2019 and rules for the exchanges that trade them in November.\nSee also: Hong Kong’s First Regulator-Approved Bitcoin Fund Targets $100M Raise\nBut the Securities and Futures Commission’s trading platform rules are only an “interim solution,” according to the report.

    "title": "Enterprise Blockchain Doesn't Work Because It's About the Real World",
    "summary": "Recording bitcoin transactions on a blockchain is fundamentally \"more accurate\" than using a blockchain for, say, birth certificates.",
    "content": "Blockchain has come a long way since its 2008 debut as the ingenious technology underlying Bitcoin. Today companies and governments the world over are exploring new applications in which blockchains track, not the flow of digital currency, but things and events in the real world. But this tether to reality is enterprise blockchain’s Achilles heel.\nTo see why, let’s go back to where it all began. When bitcoin first appeared, a common reaction was: Why would anyone exchange their hard-earned dollars for that? The answer, it’s become clear, is that bitcoin is valuable, and that is a good reason to own some – or, better put, to hold some. How much bitcoin you and everyone else holds is recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain.\nBut this is a funny kind of “record.” Most records memorialize real facts, facts that are independent of the records themselves. Take your birth certificate. It records a real event, your birth, which exists apart from the certificate. This is why it is possible for your birth certificate to be inaccurate. It could simply get the facts wrong about when and where you were born.\nBitcoin is different. The blockchain records everyone’s bitcoin holdings, but those holdings are not independent of the blockchain. Quite the opposite: How much BTC you hold depends entirely on what the blockchain says. (Philosophers call this kind of dependence “metaphysical ground.”)\nSo calling the blockchain a record of people’s bitcoin holdings is misleading. There are no real facts, existing independently of the blockchain, about how much bitcoin everyone holds. Instead, it’s better to say the blockchain just dictates how much bitcoin everyone holds. What it says, goes.\nThis means the blockchain has a remarkable property: It is guaranteed to be an accurate guide to people’s bitcoin holdings. Because the blockchain dictates how much bitcoin you hold, it can’t fail to be right in what it says about that.\nSee also: Brady Dale - Don’t Follow the Suits, Follow the Weirdos\nI’ve mostly been talking so far about blockchain’s application to cryptocurrency. It’s in those applications that the blockchain is guaranteed to be accurate (bracketing so-called double-spends or other rare events). But there are many other applications that lack any such guarantee.\nTake a case that has already come up: birth certificates. Births are real events in the world. We can design a blockchain to record those events, but the events themselves are independent of the blockchain. Unlike your bitcoin holdings, no blockchain can dictate when and where you were born. And that means it is possible for the blockchain to be inaccurate. Nothing prevents the blockchain from just being wrong about your birth.\nOf course, just as it is very hard for anyone to tamper with the transaction statements that make up the Bitcoin blockchain, it will be very hard for anyone to alter your birth records once they have been added to the birth certificate blockchain. But that does nothing to ensure those records were accurate in the first place.\nThe same goes for many other enterprise applications of blockchain. Consider supply chain management. We can design a blockchain to track diamonds from mines to jewelers, but that does not mean the diamonds are where the blockchain says they are.\nOr consider health care. We can record on a blockchain that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean the shot has really gone into your arm.\nSo we have two big groups of applications of blockchain technology: the ones in which the blockchain is nearly guaranteed to be accurate, like Bitcoin; and the ones in which it is not, like birth certificates. Call the applications in the first group accurate and those in the second group non-accurate.\nI don’t want to say that we should only ever pursue accurate applications of blockchain. Some non-accurate applications can still deliver accuracy, if they’re supplemented by something else. For example, if we have some way to ensure that birth certificates are accurate when they’re added to the blockchain, we can be sure they will remain so – even though the blockchain on its own doesn’t guarantee their accuracy. And maybe there are non-accurate applications where accuracy is unimportant or where the concept of accuracy just doesn’t apply.\nBut the distinctive potential of blockchain technology lies in accurate applications – applications where the blockchain contains data, not about some independently existing reality like births but about a reality the blockchain itself dictates, such as bitcoin holdings. In these cases, the blockchain (almost) can’t be wrong.\nSee also: Paul Brody - Public Blockchains Are Set to Reshape Global Commerce\nFor a long time, the only accurate applications were to cryptocurrency. But that is changing. The current non-fungible token (NFT) boom is a prime example. The fact that MetaKovan paid over $69 million for a NFT of Beeple’s digital artwork “Everydays” is not independent of the blockchain. Quite the contrary. His holding that NFT depends entirely on the blockchain saying he does. The blockchain dictates who holds which NFTs.\nWhat other accurate applications are there? We might try to extend the example of NFTs to the ownership of intellectual property like copyrights and trademarks, or even real property like land and houses. Of course, a house exists independently of any blockchain, but not necessarily from the fact that you own the house.\nA reworking of the foundations of property law seems unlikely anytime soon. But perhaps a more viable, accurate application is to voting. A jurisdiction (say, West Virginia) could recognize a blockchain, as opposed to a paper ballot, as the final word on what votes were cast. It could be guaranteed to give an accurate vote count.\nThe price of accuracy is unreality. The Bitcoin blockchain is accurate only because what it “records” isn’t real: Bitcoin holdings are shadows cast by the blockchain itself. Enterprise blockchains reach beyond these shadows into the real world, but in doing so they abandon the surety that is the technology’s distinctive promise.",

However, the agency scrapped that plan in the guideline's final form in November.\nIn general, China's Sichuan region has the issue of excessive hydropower electricity being wasted every year during the rainy summer season.\nFor example, the Garze prefecture government, another mountainous area in Sichuan, has said hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kWh of electricity just in 2017, with a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh that went to waste.\nAs such, the spring and summer season are usually a welcome time of year for bitcoin mining businesses in China because there will be abundant and cheap electricity resulted from the hydropower excess.\nBut this year, bitcoin's stagnating price movements ahead of the network's halving event due in two weeks have cooled down bitcoin miners' expansion investment.",

    "summary": "China’s banking and digital payment giants are using blockchain technology to add transparency to charity organizations' donation distribution networks.",
    "content": "Tens of millions of dollars have been reportedly raised to help Wuhan, a city in central China with 11 million people, to recover from its coronavirus outbreak earlier this year. However, charities in China are not widely trusted.\nNow, China’s digital payment and banking giants have been building blockchain-based platforms to tackle miscommunication between charities and the affected communities, as well as a lack of transparency in the current donation distribution system, CoinDesk Japan reported Monday.\nAlibaba, parent of AliPay, released the technical framework and industry standards for blockchain platforms for charities in September. It plans to increase transparency by tracking donations on the company’s enterprise blockchain and make it easier for people to make donations via its authentication function.\nTencent also made an effort to record donations to a nationwide charity campaign on its enterprise blockchain TUSI. The annual campaign, held on Sept. 9 every year, raised over $3 billion from more than 43 million individuals and 14,000 companies in 2019, CoinDesk Japan reported.\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of the major four state-owned commercial banks in China, included blockchain use cases for charities in a 2020 white paper on the technology’s adoption in the financial services industry.\n“During recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, ICBC has launched and promoted blockchain platforms to track donations,” the bank said in the white paper. “The Red Cross Guangxi branch and Zhuhai Charity Headquarter are currently on our platform and we will gradually invite more organizations across the country.”\nTrust crisis\nThese moves echo the State Council’s call to use emerging technologies, including blockchain, to improve the charity system in China and restore the general public’s trust in Chinese charities.\nChina’s Red Cross, one of the largest charities in the country, was criticized for not getting supplies to hospitals that were fighting the coronavirus in February. A state media outlet livestreamed a suited man loading a box of face masks into a truck with the characters on it saying “Vehicles for Government Officials” next to a Red Cross warehouse.\nRead more: Telegram CEO Donates 10 BTC to Pandemic Relief Effort\nAnother scandal caused more long-lasting damage to the Red Cross' reputation. A woman named Guo Meimei claimed she worked for the Red Cross and angered Chinese netizens by showing off her lavish lifestyle on social media in 2011. Unsubstantiated rumors said she had connections with a high-ranking Chinese official in the Red Cross and misused some funds in the charity. The organization had received tens of millions of dollars in donations on the heels of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.\nIn its proposed policy in 2016, the Chinese Red Cross Foundation said it would set up an independent third-party institution to audit and supervise the management of its supplies and donations, according to a document on the State Council's official website.",

    "summary": "...by at least two measures, that is. Decentralized finance users probably top 1 million.",
    "content": "As the Coinbase public listing approached, many analysts were looking for a $100 billion valuation. The cryptocurrency exchange, founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, hit that mark briefly after listing, but COIN has settled down to a less-rarified valuation.\nMeanwhile, CoinGecko calculates a total market capitalization of $128 billion for decentralized finance (DeFi), the corner of the cryptocurrency industry that represents a wide range of lending, trading and betting activities carried out almost entirely on blockchain networks using tokens as proceeds and collateral. The top five tokens on CoinGecko's list are UNI, LINK, LUNA, AAVE and CAKE.\nThe following chart is from a CoinGecko page that tracks the combined market cap of all DeFi tokens:\nCoinbase, it should be noted, listed DeFi as a potential competitor when it filed for a public listing, but for whatever reason, market caps aren't how we usually talk about the DeFi market. We usually talk about the value of assets people have deposited in DeFi apps to earn yield.\nBut that measure gives a similar reading: There is now more than $100 billion worth of assets locked up in DeFi.\nThese get to be very large numbers, numbers that are worth reviewing to illuminate a story that somehow continues to be missed even as cryptocurrency has started going mainstream.\nHere at CoinDesk we have focused on DeFi on Ethereum because DeFi originated on Ethereum, and it is where the best-known entrepreneurs have committed to operating.\nThose aforementioned deposited assets are referred to as total value locked (TVL). TVL on Ethereum, using the most widely cited data site, DeFi Pulse, is $66 billion as of this writing, more than quadrupling since Jan. 1 when it was $15 billion.\nMeanwhile, DeFi has taken off in a big way on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). According to Defistation, the current TVL on there is $38 billion, led by PancakeSwap but also including money markets filling a similar role to Aave and derivative solutions that fill a similar role to dydx.\nDeFi on BSC has grown much faster than on Ethereum; it first hit $1 billion in TVL only at the end of January.\nDeFi vs. ICOs\nHere's a chart that compares funds entrusted to Ethereum's many DeFi smart contracts in the last year or so to funds that went to founders in initial coin offerings during the 2017-2018 boom (an updated version of one published here):\nIt should be noted that DeFi Pulse was in the midst of updating how it tracks the TVL for the robo-adviser for yield, Yearn Finance, when this was made, and so those numbers aren't in this graph. According to Yearn itself, though, it has had several billion dollars tied up.\nRead more: DeFi reshapes the CoinDesk 20\nWhile the 2020 surge was known as \"DeFi Summer,\" it's already evident the market is much bigger now.\nFor example, TVL first broke $1 billion in February 2020. It broke $10 billion in September, on Ethereum. Earlier this month, the money market platform Compound broke $10 billion in TVL all on its own.\nTuesday night, the original DeFi protocol, stablecoin minter MakerDAO, also broke $10 billion for the first time.\n1 million users? Maybe 2 million?\nRichard Chen, at the venture firm 1confirmation, has been assembling on-chain data about users using Dune Analytics. One chart is worth citing here in particular.\nThis shows there are at least 2 million wallets that have interacted with DeFi protocols. So that probably means something like more than a million individuals, maybe even close to two? It's very hard to say, but it is also worth noting that sometimes individuals participate in DeFi via third parties. So while some users hold many wallets, it's also true that some wallets represent many users.\nWhatever the real count of users, the amount of money changing hands shows these applications are real businesses. The site Crypto Fees has been tracking usage fees charged on different DeFi applications. The top DeFi applications it lists (Uniswap, SushiSwap and Compound) show a seven-day average of daily fees collected ranging from $1 million to $4 million.\nIf there's one kind of finance that everyone understands, it is lending. The blockchain software company ConsenSys just released a first-quarter report on DeFi on Ethereum, showing a growing market for loans:\nDeFi represents a much more credible narrative with more substantive businesses because it shows products with genuine returns and provides a way for people to earn impressive yields on deposits rather than making wild bets and hoping.\nWild bets are the best way to describe much (though certainly not all) of the investing that took place in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 to 2018. That boom drove the prior bull run, and the public appeared capable of making that connection.\nFour years later, the cryptocurrency industry is in a bull run again, but the public appears incapable of connecting it to these billion-dollar deposits into this new iteration on finance. For whatever reason, the main topics are, again, bitcoin's price and, somehow, non-fungible tokens and dogecoin.",

    "content": "A hospital in China sent the first electronic bill to a patient on its blockchain-based invoice management platform on Monday.\nThe People’s Hospital of Chengmai County, a public hospital in the Hainan province of South China, is the first hospital to issue and keep track of invoices on a blockchain in the province, according to a report by Chinese state media China News Service.\nWhile not the first in China, Hainan is one of the few provinces that have successfully incorporated blockchain technology into their public institutions’ online administrative platforms.\nThe hospital sent invoices to so-called “ticket holders” on its patients’ phones. The patients can check the immutable medical and billing records for reimbursement without going to the hospital, according to the report.\nThe platform is now only available in the city but it is set to branch out to the rest of the province as the local government is focused on applying blockchain technology to processing official documents for other public institutions.\n“Building on the pilot projects, we will optimize blockchain-based platforms and move more administrative work onto the chain so that government agencies can share information through the same system,” an official from the province’s ministry of finance said.\nThe southern Chinese province has preferential economic policies to lure blockchain companies to open offices in the province. The province capital Haikou is home to some of the leading Chinese blockchain companies, including Huobi China.\nProvincial governments have carried out a variety of blockchain innovation initiatives since Chinese president Xi Jinping called on the nation to “seize the opportunities” to develop the technology in his speech in September 2019.\nThe Beijing government unveiled its holistic plan to encourage financial services companies to better serve the capital markets with blockchain technology, while Shanghai included two blockchain projects in its list of 57 strategically important high-tech companies that will receive monetary and intellectual support from the city.",

    "title": "'Decentralized ID at All Costs': Adviser Quits ID2020 Over Blockchain Fixation",
    "summary": "ID2020 was moving too fast to adopt unproven technology, including distributed ledgers, for immunity passes, said prominent researcher Elizabeth Renieris.",
    "content": "An adviser to the ID2020 Alliance, which aims to bring digital identities to billions of people, has resigned over the organization's direction on digital immunity passes and COVID-19.\nIn her resignation email Friday, Elizabeth Renieris cited ID2020’s opacity, “techno-solutionism” and corporate influence along with the risks of applying blockchain to immunity passes.\n\"At this stage, I can no longer even describe what ID2020's mission is with any confidence,\" wrote Renieris, who was one of six members of ID2020’s technical advisory committee. \"All I can perceive is a desire to promote decentralized identity solutions at all costs.\"\nRenieris (an occasional CoinDesk contributor) is a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and an expert in cross-border data protection and privacy issues. She was previously in-house counsel at two digital identity startups.\nHer concerns about the technology, which highlight the trade-offs between health and privacy during the pandemic, are spelled out in a white paper published in mid-May. She says the introduction of immunity passes could interfere with people’s privacy, freedom of association, assembly, and movement.\n“Blockchain-enabled ‘immunity certificates’ or ‘immunity passports’ for COVID-19, if implemented by public authorities, would have serious consequences for our fundamental human rights and civil liberties,” she writes.\nThe discord within ID2020 hints at larger debates around where to use distributed ledger technology (DLT), and where it may create more problems than it solves. But when it comes to the issue of immunity passes, the stakes seem higher.\nRenieris worries about how the influence of corporations like Microsoft may influence the development of these systems.\nKim Cameron, Architect of Identity at Microsoft, sits on ID2020’s board, and Kim Gagné, newly appointed as Board Chair, also worked at Microsoft.\n“Who is doing the building here is a critical vulnerability, as critical as any technical challenge,” said Renieris. “This is 100% a hammer looking for a nail.”\nTicket to ride?\nImmunity passports or certificates are digital or physical documents that individuals would receive if they had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. Traditionally, development of antibodies after a disease offers some level of immunity, though scientists are still working to sort out whether this is the case, or how long such immunity might last, when it comes to COVID-19. Potentially, immunity passports allow people to return to work and have greater freedom of movement.\nSee also: Immunity Passes Explained: Should We Worry About Privacy?\nIn late April, the World Health Organization warned against the idea of immunity passports, and said there was “no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.” But countries such as Chile said they would move ahead with such passes, despite the WHO’s warning.\nThe ID2020 Alliance is a public-private partnership, with partners including Microsoft, Accenture and Hyperledger. It hopes to develop a global model for the design, funding, and implementation of “digital ID solutions and technologies,” according to the website.\nID2020 published a white paper in April urging policymakers, technology providers, and civil society groups to collaborate to ensure that digital health credentials or “immunity certificates,” if implemented, are designed to protect privacy and civil liberties.\nAccording to Renieris, the paper initially cited the Covid Credentials Initiative (which is advocating for immunity passes based in part on blockchain) and Microsoft’s work with blockchain. It said these are potential solutions for privacy and identity questions around immunity passes. But when Renieris queried their inclusion, the section was dropped because, says Renieris, ID2020 did not want to deal with the tech problems those initiatives would raise.\nThe initiative neglects to acknowledge any technology-specific risks of a blockchain based approach, instead highlighting generic risks that could apply to any technological solution, said Renieris. While she says she was told the paper would be published as Executive Director Dakota Gruener’s personal view, the press release that was put out around the paper framed it as an ID2020 paper.\n\"I cannot be part of an organization overly influenced by commercial interests that that only pays lip service to human rights,\" she wrote in her resignation. \"The stakes are simply too high at this stage.\"\nID2020, Microsoft respond\nIn a statement to CoinDesk, Gruener said technology solutions are not a panacea for the pandemic and must be accompanied by robust, fit-for-purpose trust frameworks and legislative and regulatory actions to ensure ethical implementation and transparency.\nID2020 has sought feedback from civil liberties and digital privacy groups to ensure that these considerations are built into the technical architecture of any digital health certificate system.\n“The stakes are high and we have one chance to get this right,” said Gruener. “Even with these safeguards in place, digital health certificates may still be insufficient to meet the current challenge. However, absent such safeguards, we can be assured that they will do more harm than good.”\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it's deliberately trying not to have an outsized influence in this area.\n“For the last two years Microsoft has been working with industry partners in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and ID2020 to lay the groundwork for an open standards-based, privacy-enhancing, identity system which will give people control over where they store their personal information and who they share it with,\" said Alex Simons, the company's corporate vice president for identity program management.\n\"A key tenet of this effort is designing the system so that no single company or organization, including Microsoft, owns or controls it. Instead, to be trusted, we believe the system has to be inherently decentralized,\" Simons said in a statement.\nAs CoinDesk reported previously, a number of organizations and companies are actively exploring the idea of immunity passes based on blockchain technology.\nSee also: Citizen App’s New Contact Tracing Feature Raises Privacy Red Flags\nRenieris wrote the paper published in May with global health researcher Sherri Bucher of Indiana University School of Medicine,and Christian Smith, CEO of Stranger Labs, which researches, develops, and designs advanced technologies that enhance privacy and security.\nIn it they criticize the CCI initiative ID2020 initially touted, which proposes combining a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard for Verifiable Credentials (VCs) with non-standard decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and DLT. The architecture is a product of premature standardization, experimental technologies, and speculative requirements, the authors argue, questioning whether these solutions can support such a critical role in public safety as immunity passes.\nThey also criticize the lack of a proven method of private key management for end-users, especially in offline instances, which digital immunity passports would likely have to include, and say the VC specification merely “provides a data model, not a complete protocol or end-to-end solution.”\nUPDATE (May 29, 00:15 UTC): This article was updated after publication with additional comments from Elizabeth Renieris and from a Microsoft executive.",

    "summary": "The company told CoinDesk that even though ICOs and fiat-to-crypto trading are not allowed in China, crypto-to-crypto trading is not banned.",
    "content": "The Chinese government doesn't officially allow its people to buy cryptocurrencies with cash, and the country is working on a digital version of its yuan that would be closely controlled by authorities.\nBut guess what is apparently allowed? Decentralized finance, known as DeFi, encompassing the fast-growing realm of mostly autonomous, blockchain-based software projects designed to automatically lend and exchange cryptocurrencies, and maybe someday replace banks.\nConflux, a blockchain startup backed by the city of Shanghai, said Wednesday it has formed a strategic partnership with the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx's decentralized public blockchain, OKExChain, to help DeFi projects enter the Chinese market. Conflux claims to be the only \"public, permissionless\" blockchain endorsed by the government. The term \"permissionless\" indicates that control over the network is decentralized.\nThe partnership will allow Conflux to \"wrap\" tokens from selected DeFi projects with its native token CFX, which was recently listed on OKEx. In crypto industry jargon, \"wrapping\" a token means it's retrofitted into a new token that can move over another blockchain, similar to the way a truck trailer might be loaded onto a railroad car.\nThe Conflux project could help these emerging DeFi projects to receive \"full support\" of the OKExChain ecosystem, a representative from Conflux told CoinDesk. OKEx, the exchange behind OKExChain, is one of the so-called Big Three cryptocurrency exchanges closely linked to the Chinese market, including Binance and Huobi.\n“Conflux is the only regulatory-compliant public, permissionless chain in China because we specifically did not have a public token sale, which has allowed us to remain compliant and in good standing within China,” a company representative told CoinDesk. DeFi projects “don’t necessarily need Conflux to enter the Asia market, but Conflux-wrapped assets are considered regulator-friendly in China, so we’re offering a compliant way for projects to list on a public exchange in China.”\nAs part of the announcement, Conflux revealed eight new DeFi projects in the first cohort of its program, all of which will have their tokens wrapped to CFX and can move freely between Conflux and OKExChain. These \"wrapped tokens\" are backed by an equal amount of CFX, the news release said.\nRead More: Shanghai Government Invests $5M in Blockchain Startup Conflux\nThe company told CoinDesk that even though initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fiat-to-crypto trading are not allowed in China, crypto-to-crypto trading is not banned, meaning that Conflux can “remain compliant and serve as a point of entry for projects interested in entering the local market.”\n“The Chinese government is mainly trying to protect its citizens while seeking to better understand the value of public blockchain technology,” the company said.\nLittle known to the Western world, Conflux has received considerable attention in China both from state and media outlets. The company recently received millions of dollars in grant money from the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee and Xuhui District government, part of Shanghai’s municipal government.\nA video clip on state-owned satellite TV station Dragon Television described the Conflux blockchain as having been “developed by Shanghai.” The report went on to note that the network's performance has exceeded that of Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of transactions per second and transaction confirmation times.\nOn Weibo, China’s equivalent to Twitter, some users even called CFX the “Shanghai token” due to the startup’s close relationship with the Shanghai government.\n\"It's very encouraging to see such high-quality blockchain projects like Conflux Network that are committed to transparency, decentralization, interoperability and regulatory compliance partnering with OKExChain,\" Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, told CoinDesk through a representative. \"These are the qualities that will enable strong and sustainable growth moving forward and attract developer talent from the wider ecosystem.\"\nUPDATE (March 24, 2021, 14:25 UTC): In an earlier version of this article CoinDesk reported the eight DeFi tokens selected by Conflux would be wrapped to CFX tokens and traded on OKEx, based on a company press release. After publication, representatives from OKEx and Conflux clarified the DeFi tokens would not necessarily be listed for trading on OKEx, but that the selected DeFi tokens can move freely between Conflux and OKExChain.",

    "title": "How the DeFi Craze Made Its Way to China",
    "summary": "DeFi is booming in China, with startups adapting and building on popular western projects within the nation's active crypto economy.",
    "content": "When Nervos co-founder Guoning Lü saw a few China-based decentralized finance (DeFi) projects raise millions of dollars in a matter of hours, he knew the DeFi craze had officially reached the East.\nOne project saw its total value locked (TVL) climb from $2.9 million to $14.4 million within two weeks after launching in August, before tripling three days later. The project called DODO, a liquidity provider founded by a Chinese development team, now has total value locked (TVL) – the total amount of assets staked in the protocol – of over $100 million, ranking 16th in DeFi Pulse as of press time.\nDeFi is one of the hottest trends in the crypto world. So it’s not surprising the DeFi craze would find its way to China, which has an active cryptocurrency community despite government restrictions on trading and token sales.\nChinese startups are playing a crucial role in the DeFi boom with highly localized and nimble adaptations of western projects as well as a marketing apparatus that is laser-focused on Chinese crypto communities, industry watchers say.\nFrom July through the middle of October, the number of searches for DeFi has soared on China's social media platform WeChat. It has almost doubled during this period of time, according to WeChat Index, a data analysis tool that includes keyword searches, articles and forwards in WeChat moments.\nMajor Defi projects, such as NEST, DForce and YFII, all with huge Chinese followings, have raised millions of dollars in the span of a few weeks and topped the TVL ranking on DeFi Pulse.\nNot just copycats\nChina often has a reputation for adapting western products to local markets, or in some cases mimicking them. Compound alleged China-based DForce “stole” its code and Chinese liquidity mining site YFII cloned another foreign-based project, Yearn.Finance (YFI).\n“Admittedly, many Chinese projects copy code from western DeFi pioneers such as the liquidity leader Yearn.Finance and decentralized exchange UniSwap,” Nervos’ Lü said. “However, Chinese companies are making innovations in localizing the original products and that is what makes DeFi products more popular in the country.”\nDeFi-friendly crypto wallets, centralized exchanges’ financing schemes for retail investors and targeted marketing strategies are among the localized products and services that Chinese startups have created to pave the way for DeFi inside the country.\nChinese DeFi startups reach many crypto investors through wallets.\n“Not many people know how to use DeFi applications directly given its complex technical features and financial schemes,” Lü said. “However, many Chinese crypto wallets simplify and optimize processes for users to participate in DeFi projects.”\nHangzhou-based imToken, for example, is one of the most popular mobile wallets in China. It has a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), Tokenlon, enabling its users to trade tokens from different dapps on Ethereum, EOS and TRON within the wallet.\nWhile the wallet is natively integrated with blockchain protocol Kyber, the in-wallet DEX is built on top of the code from another DeFi project 0x. Founded in 2016, imToken secured $10 million through a Series A round led by IDG Capital two years ago.\nWhile some U.S. counterparts may also provide similar services, such wallets have emerged to be one of the major channels for Chinese investors to participate in DeFi, Lü said\nTrading costs are another hurdle for retail investors to participate in DeFi. As most DeFi dapps run on Ethereum, transaction fees on the blockchain have become prohibitively high for smaller investors.\nCentralized exchanges, which are major players behind the Chinese DeFi scene, have a solution for that, said Jason Wu, CEO of decentralized crypto lending startup DeFiner.\n“Centralized exchanges are pooling money from retail inventors to invest in DeFi so that millions of Chinese smaller investors can afford the high gas fees in the projects,” Wu said. In turn, these centralized exchanges increase trading volume and earn more fees by listing and trading the native governance tokens of such DeFi projects on their platform.\nSpreading the word\nCommunity building and marketing strategies are crucial to the success of a DeFi project. In China, key opinion leaders (KOLs), in-person meetups and online Ask Me Anything (AMA) gatherings are all key parts of the crypto marketing apparatus, Jason Wu said.\n“The crypto space, including DeFi, is very KOL-driven,” said Sharlyn Wu, chief investment officer at Huobi DeFi Labs. “For a new project coming to the market, you need a number of KOL to support it and the KOL will influence a bigger group of audience to get into the projects.”\nMany of the KOLs in China understand English, and they translate and process the western thought leaders’ content to inform the Chinese crypto community, according to Jason Wu.\nThere are three tiers of KOLs, says Sharlyn Wu. “The KOLs in tier 1 dig into white papers, code and the formula of economic models and the tier 2 KOLs basically translate to the Chinese community. Tier 3 KOLs are the ones who move things to the border retail market.”\nThese Chinese influencers tend to be researchers, venture capitalists and crypto journalists, Sharlyn Wu said.\nNow, in-person meetings and conferences are coming back as China appears to have contained the spread of coronavirus. DeFi-themed gatherings have increased recently in China, Jason Wu said.\n“Last week, I attended three conferences across three Chinese cities. Some of the conferences held more than 1,000 participants,” said Jason Wu, who has launched his own DeFi project recently. “There are retail investors, but most people there are business development managers from centralized exchanges, DeFi startups and crypto media members.”\nWu said Chinese KOLs tend not to use Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, as their main social platform. He noted there are many limitations on topics you can post about, such as direct trading between fiat and cryptocurrencies.\nWeChat is also where most online meetings take place in the crypto community. Through Ask Me Anythings (AMAs), crypto investors ask Chinese KOLs about new DeFi products and the latest industry trends.\nAccording to Jason Wu, Chinese crypto media also plays an important role in informing people of new DeFi projects, in addition to organizing conferences. They tend to focus on the technical side of the crypto business since the Chinese central bank restricts the promotion of crypto trading.\nDeep pockets\n“Capital in crypto is always on the lookout for returns, and DeFi has offered a great opportunity.” Lü said. “When liquidity mining took off earlier this year, the capital started not only flowing into but concentrated in the DeFi space.”\nThe capital that backs Chinese DeFi projects might not come from new capital but two existing forces that have existed in the Chinese crypto industry for a long time, he said.\nOn the one hand are the industrialists who have invested in infrastructure and ecosystem, who share dividends as the whole space grows, he says. On the other are institutional investors that tend to be more speculative and prioritize short-term gains.\nChina’s deep pockets in crypto can be traced back to its crypto mining industry with miner maker giants such as Bitmain and MicroBT.\nChina-originated centralized exchanges such as Huobi, KuCoin and Binance have also been a driving force behind many crypto crazes in China.\nHowever, helping DEX upstarts could become a problem for China-originated centralized exchanges such as Binance. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said centralized exchanges might have to share the crypto trading market with DEXs.\nBinance, Huobi and Kucoin, three exchange giants birthed in China, have made efforts to get into the DeFi space. Binance recently rolled out its patented blockchain, where developers can build DeFi applications on the platform, while Huobi launched DeFi Labs to back DeFi hopefuls. All three exchanges have listed DeFi assets such as governance tokens for trading.\nThe first wave that hit China’s DeFi scene is casino-style gambling, Sharlyn Wu said, noting there has been too much speculation in the market. But this could change. And China may not always be in the position of following the West.\n“Even though Asia was initially behind in the first wave of the DeFi from the U.S., I think developers in China will lead DeFi the way they have led CeFi,” Sharlyn Wu said.",

    "content": "Nuggets, a digital identity and payments platform, has developed a way to accept deliveries without needing a physical signature to combat a spike in fraud and chargebacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUsing biometrically verified contactless delivery technology secured with blockchain technology, the London-based firm wants to equip consumers with the means to provide verified proof of identification while still maintaining the social distancing required under coronavirus measures.\nNuggests says the contact-free signing system would help counter a rise in delivery fraud and chargebacks amid the pandemic. Since customers no longer have to sign for deliveries in order to maintain distancing, fraudulent chargebacks are skyrocketing. Citing figures from the U.K., Nuggets also said failed deliveries have also cost courier firms as much as £1.6 billion (US$2 billion).\n“Merchants are so overstretched with increased orders, staffing issues and supply chain fulfilment problems that having to dispute chargebacks ends up at the bottom of the list,\" said Nuggets CEO and co-founder Alastair Johnson.\nSee also: FATF Releases Guidance on Global Digital IDs as Use Cases Grow\nDuring a delivery, the courier would use an app to scan the receiver's digital ID (issued by Nugget) to verify they are indeed the customer who ordered the item(s).\nWhen the customer is successfully identified, the parcel is delivered and a proof of delivery is immediately sent to the company at which the purchase was made. Nuggets said the system \"guarantees verified delivery of a package to the right recipient,\" while using a blockchain allows for the secure communication of customers' biometric and payment information.\nE-commerce has seen a huge boost in recent months, due largely to coronavirus stay-at-home orders. Global courier DHL \"has seen volume growth of more than 36% in domestic volume and 28% cross border volume from the daily averages seen in February,\" industry publication Aircargo News reported on May 14.\nSee also: Immunity Passes Explained: Should We Worry About Privacy?\n“The combination of the astronomical costs facing our eCommerce businesses, from fraudulent chargebacks to failed deliveries and fake user reviews, big savings can be delivered by having Nuggets integrated, said Johnson.\nCoinDesk reached out to ask the firm when its technology might see real-world adoption but did not immediately hear back.",

    "summary": "The DADA Art Collective is using blockchain to promote Black Lives Matter and calls for police reform. Here's how tokens can be a form of protest.",
    "content": "A blockchain-centric art project is pushing the boundaries of modern art with a controversial digital display.\nThe DADA Art Collective, a loosely affiliated group of roughly a dozen visual artists across the globe, teamed up with the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces OpenSea and Mintbase plus the file-storage blockchain Arweave to publish the names and faces of American police officers accused of killing unarmed black people.\nThe project, No Justice No Peace, was published June 6 in collaboration with crypto veteran Dennison Bertram, founder of the DappHero project.\n“The collective got in touch with me,” Bertram said. “Social justice is something that I’ve always been interested in. They’d already minted and created these tokens. … It’s a fascinating demonstration of how to do social protests using blockchain technology.”\nThe DADA Collective’s Judy Mam said 10 artists contributed to this piece to support Black Lives Matter and police reform, with pictures of 30 officers along with their alleged crimes and case statuses.\nThe artists leveraged Arweave’s blockchain to create a wallet associated with each person killed, holding tokens that have data for the corresponding officers’ information.\n“The private keys of the wallets that control these tokens have been destroyed. No one controls these tokens. These tokens can’t be censored, modified or taken down,” the project’s website says.\n“Blockchain is itself a political statement, the ability to organize outside of government control,” Bertam said. “What about decentralizing justice or human rights or other aspects of society that are critical to the ways people live?”\nAnd yet, this project raises tricky questions about the ethics of immutable digital records. In Europe, lawmakers have introduced a \"right to be forgotten\" with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even in the United States, Mam said the artists behind this project prefer to stay anonymous because some jurisdictions limit access to evidence that might incriminate police officers.\n“The police do take action against [outspoken] people,” Mam said. “These [visual pieces] are tokenized but they’re not for sale. … It was about making a statement.”\nBlack Lives Matter\nWith simple text beneath black and white photos, the message is clear. There’s scant artistic flourish in this piece.\n“We don’t forget. We find out who you are,” Mam said. “Maybe someday some of these men will get a [prison] sentence. … But at least now there’s a record that is there forever, immutably, of these people and their crimes.”\nThe criminal justice system failed to proceed with formal charges in most of these cases, despite community efforts, according to research from Bowling Green State University. This piece is just one of many activist projects already curating public lists with such information. Howard University student and crypto aficionado Gerald Nash, who was not affiliated with the “No Justice No Peace,” said he thinks the project is interesting.\n“People should take into account this isn’t an organization doing unbiased research,” Nash said of the art collective. “As a black person and someone who wants to see justice. ... I see no difference between this and holding up a sign.”\nOf course, “censorship resistance” is a relative term. Governments could make it difficult to access affiliated websites and keyword searches, even if the blockchain data remains unaltered. Some experts would also argue a blockchain’s immutability depends on its incentive structure and participants, which likely are not infallible. The Arweave blockchain’s distribution is still nascent, with less than 3,000 members in the project’s Discord group.\nEven with these limitations, University of New Hampshire law professor Tonya Evans agreed this art project is an interesting use case – memorializing information.\n“I would compare it to what news reporters do … [but] reporters have to be very thoughtful about ways to correct the record, even if that’s to add to and not take away from,” Evans said, describing American freedom of speech laws. “Code is also speech. It will be interesting to see what type of innovation emerges during this period with regards to protecting free speech.”",

    "content": "The Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), the blockchain infrastructure provider backed by the Chinese government, plans to offer blockchain analytics and financial auditing services for Ethereum developers in its network through a new partnership with Big Four auditor Ernst & Young (EY).\nThe London-based accounting firm will provide BSN’s Ethereum users in China with two compliance products – EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer – according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.\nEY OpsChain will integrate procurement and traceability functions into BSN, where its users on Ethereum can run procurement activities using tokens and smart contracts. The EY Blockchain Analyzer will offer blockchain analytics and financial statement audits to the users.\nThe new compliance services could further boost China’s efforts in the blockchain race against the U.S. More BSN’s users will be able to build and run blockchain projects in the network without worrying about compliance issues.\n“China is one of the largest markets for blockchain technology in the world, and, while EY teams have been operating there for several years, this is the EY organization’s first big step in deploying the EY blockchain platform in a scalable manner,” Paul Brody, global blockchain head at EY, said in the statement.\nBSN was co-founded by state-owned telecom giant China Mobile, UnionPay and fintech startup Red Date in April 2020. The project aims to provide cloud services and a standardized development environment for blockchain developers.\nBSN is split into two versions: a domestic version, where only permissioned blockchains are available, and a global version, which allows developers around the world to build or run decentralized applications (dapps) on public chains adapted to its development environment. BSN “localized” Ethereum in its domestic version by making it an open permissioned blockchain, which could be controlled by an enterprise.\n“Initial availability will focus on the planned open permissioned version of Ethereum in China with a future extension to a controlled access version of the Ethereum network across the globe when it becomes available,” the statement said.\nThe move came after New York-based Ethereum hub ConsenSys teamed up with BSN in January. That partnership aims to bring ConsenSys’ enterprise ledger, Quorum, to China’s nationwide blockchain project.\nBSN was co-founded by state-owned telecom giant China Mobile, UnionPay and fintech startup Red Date in April 2020. The project aims to provide cloud services and a standardized development environment for blockchain developers.\nEY has also joined the Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium (FISCO), a Chinese non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the use of blockchain for financial applications. The accounting firm will use FISCO’s platform to make its compliance services available to more users in China and other Asia-Pacific regions, according to the statement.\n“By offering both FISCO BCOS and Ethereum, EY professionals will serve clients within China and across the Asia-Pacific region and connect those users to the global blockchain,” Brody said. “I see this as a key step forward in connecting the world’s largest economies through blockchain technology.”",

    "content": "TechCrunch is currently hosting its Disrupt NY 2014 conference, spiced up with a hackathon and an interesting ‘battle’ between 30 startups. Of course, no disruptive tech event would be complete without digital currencies, so TechCrunch obliged.\nRipple’s Susan Athey and Blockchain’s Peter Smith took to the stage at the event to share their thoughts on cryptocurrencies and the current state of bitcoin.\nMedia obsession\nAthey cautioned against the media’s incessant focus on the bitcoin exchange rate.\n“I think the focus on the exchange rate is a little overrated. I mean it’s fun to watch the price move around, but if I wanted to send funds to you, say, in Japan, I only care about the bitcoin exchange rate for about 10 minutes,” she said. “The level of the exchange rate is really irrelevant for its use as a transaction medium.”\nWe have heard similar statements from bitcoin execs in the past, but the focus is slowly shifting toward matters generally considered more important, such as VC-funding of bitcoin companies and the real-life applications of cryptocurrencies and block-chain technology.\nAthey pointed out that even gold has a premium on top of its intrinsic value. As bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it’s value is solely premium, she said, explaining:\nShe further said there were some deviations from historical trends, but it is possible to imperfectly predict the value based on the transaction volume.\nExchange warning\nAsked to comment on the demise of Mt. Gox and its effect on bitcoin, Peter Smith said the overall impact will be relatively small.\nHowever, he also used Mt. Gox as a cautionary tale, as an example of why bitcoin startups should not centralize their operation – namely their bitcoin storage. Smith said Blockchain never takes possession of the funds, always keeps its software open source and works to decentralize trust rather than centralize it.\nSmith explained that centralized exchanges are vulnerable and that almost all services that have ‘centralized trust’ have suffered significant security breaches and incurred losses, adding:\nSmith went on to criticize the basic concept of centralising trust.\n“I don’t think that business models that take away the core value proposition of the bitcoin protocol are a good idea,” he said.\nThe bottom line is, Smith believes startups that centralize trust are doing it wrong.\nImages via TechCrunch",

In other words, if someone used a blockchain ledger to store information, the bill would legally recognize that person's rights to that information.\nSimilarly, the bill states:\nIf signed into law, the bill would make Florida the latest state to recognize blockchain records and smart contracts. Last year, Arizona passed a similar measure, with identical notes on confirming blockchain records as electronic records, as well as giving smart contracts legal force.\nA slightly different bill\nin Vermont, when passed in 2016, allowed for the use of blockchain-based data as evidence in court.\nFlorida flag image via KMH Photovideo / Shutterstock",

The service has seen more than 800% growth year-over-year: it had just over 110,000 registered users as of January 2013.\nThe company told CoinDesk it received 13,192 entries to the contest, which was open to anyone who liked the Blockchain.info Facebook page. It then used Rafflecopter to generate a winner using a Random.org number generator.\n\"We wanted to do it differently this time, so that all users could participate through Facebook or with an email address,\" a spokesperson for Blockchain.info said.\n— Blockchain.info (@blockchain) January 15, 2014\nAs the winner, Wright had the option to receive either 10 BTC ($8,786 at market price as of the time of writing) or a vacation of equal value through BTCTrip.com.\nWright told CoinDesk that he elected to receive the 10 BTC prize package, as his minor status might prohibit him from truly enjoying his vacation. But, despite the implications, the young photographer says he plans to spend his money responsibly.\n\"I have been getting a lot of suggestions to buy cocaine and hookers, but I'm probably going to save instead,\" Wright said.\nWright learned of his prize through an email from the Blockchain.info team giving him just 24 hours to respond to claim the prize. Because of the nature of the email, Wright initially thought the prize was a scam, but says he was thrilled once he confirmed its validity online.\nThe high school junior aspires to go to college in Colorado with his brother, and says he will dedicate 1 BTC to his shopping list in preparation for the big move. But, though his focus is on the future, Wright says the increased notoriety is having implications at his high school. He noted that he's already been approached by several casual acquaintances about the prize.\nSince the price of bitcoin hit $1,000 USD, Wright says he has become involved in cryptocurrency, but primarily in dogecoin due to its low mining difficulty. Wright currently runs CoinWrite, a content and news outlet that pays writers in cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin, bitcoin and litecoin.",

    "summary": "The blockchain could very well change the infrastructure of the Internet. Here's what the new Internet could look like in 10 years.",
    "content": "Joel Monegro has been part of the Union Square Ventures Investment Team since July 2014. Previously, he co-founded three startups, ran a boutique software development shop, and studied Computer Science and Economics.\nThe first thing Brad [Burnham] taught me when I joined Union Square Ventures is that one of the greatest things about working in the venture capital business is that you get to look at markets from a very different vantage point. Every day, we have the privilege to learn what the future is going to look like from the companies and entrepreneurs who are building it. It’s thrilling, especially if you’re technology geeks like we are.\nWe spend a lot of time looking at everything that’s going on with bitcoin and the blockchain. This involves emailing, tweeting, texting, calling, skyping and meeting with teams all over the world who are building next-generation technologies and applications that leverage the blockchain to undo many of the paradigms that dominate the software business today.\nSome are just ideas, some are products already in the market. Some have flopped, and some have gone on to raise millions of dollars in funding. Being exposed to all of these has allowed us to identify certain patterns and trends that are helping us build an image of what’s coming. I’d like to begin sharing with everyone, as well as invite you to help us think through this.\nThis is what I think the architecture of Internet applications is going to look like in 10 years. This is just a simple illustration and it leaves a lot of important insights and issues out. I’ll try my best to explain the thinking behind it below. To keep things short, we’ll run through every part of the stack from the bottom up, and do a deep dive on each in future posts.\nThe basic idea is that everything inside the gray rectangles is decentralized and open source. For now I’m calling these the shared data and protocol layers. Nobody controls these parts of the system, and they’re accessible by any person or company. If we use bitcoin as an example, the blockchain is the shared data layer and the bitcoin protocol is a decentralized protocol that’s part of the shared protocol Layer.\nYou’ll notice that each layer gets thinner the higher up you go. You’ll also notice that the shared data and protocol layers cover about 80% of the entire stack. Internet applications today are built on top of open, decentralized technologies like TCP/IP and HTTP, but if you were to graph the current Internet application stack like above, those open, decentralized protocols would probably only make up about 15% with everything on top being private and centralized.\n1. Miners and the blockchain\nIf you know a little about how bitcoin works, you know what miners are. In a nutshell, miners are the nodes in a network of computers who, together, verify all bitcoin transactions. In exchange, the algorithm rewards them with bitcoin. Because bitcoin has real-world value, the operators of these machines are incentivized to keep them running. If you’d like to learn more about mining, this is a great explanation of how they work.\nThe blockchain is the public ledger that holds a permanent record of all bitcoin transactions, and is maintained by the miners. It’s not controlled by a single entity and it’s accessible by everyone. You can read more about the blockchain here.\n2. Overlay networks\nThis is where things start to get interesting. Developers are starting to build networks that work in parallel to the bitcoin blockchain to perform tasks that the bitcoin network can’t, but that make use of the bitcoin blockchain to, for instance, timestamp or validate their work.\nOne example is Counterparty. Another might be sidechains. Whatever form these overlay networks take, the one thing they have in common is their connection to the bitcoin blockchain, and how they benefit from its network effects to achieve liquidity without having to bootstrap their own alternative cryptocurrency and/or blockchain like alternative solutions such as Ethereum require.\n3. Decentralized protocols\nThanks to the blockchain, for the first time we can develop open source, decentralized protocols with built-in data (thanks to overlay networks and the blockchain), validation, and transactions that are not controlled by a single entity. This is where the traditional architecture of software businesses begins to break down. The best example of a decentralized protocol on top of a shared data layer is bitcoin, and we’re already well aware of how it’s affecting money and finance.\nCompanies like eBay, Facebook and Uber are very valuable because they benefit tremendously from the network effects that come from keeping all user information centralized in private silos and taking a cut of all the transactions.\nDecentralized protocols on top of the blockchain have the potential to undo every single part of the stacks that make these services valuable to consumers and investors. They can do this by, for example, creating common, decentralized data sets to which any one can plug into, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions powered by bitcoin.\nIn fact, a number of promising teams have already begun working on the protocols that will disrupt the business models of the companies above. One example is Lazooz, a protocol for real-time ride sharing and another is OpenBazaar, a protocol for free, decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces.\n4. Open source and commercial APIs\nProtocols are hard for the average developer to build on top of, so there’s an opportunity in making it easy to connect to them. Whether it’s a good business in the long term is up for debate, but I think it’s a very important part of the stack.\nMaking it quick and easy for developers of any skill set to quickly build an application and experiment on top of these decentralized protocols is paramount to their success.\nThese will be either commercial services or open source projects. Good examples of this trend are Chain's APIs and Coinbase’s Toshi for bitcoin. They both serve the same purpose, but Chain is a hosted, commercial service, and Toshi is open source.\n5. Applications\nThis is the consumer-facing part of the stack. Applications built atop this architecture will, in most cases, work very similarly to the ones we have today – just like Coinbase works similarly to PayPal.\nThe big difference to consumers, however, is that because they are built on decentralized protocols, they will be able to talk to each other, just like different email applications and bitcoin wallets can interoperate.\nOne thing I like about this stack is that it’s growing from the bottom up. First we had miners, the blockchain, and bitcoin, and now we’re building everything else on top. As far as I know, the most significant revolutions in technology have been built this way.\nThis imposes a very interesting set of challenges for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors as so much of the value in the current Internet stack will be commoditized by this architecture. But the best thing about this stack is that the user is better off thanks to lower or nonexistent take rates, switching costs, individual ownership of data and consumer market power.\nThis article has been republished here with permission from the author.

    "summary": "The BitLicense may have dominated media coverage this week, but a deeper dive show many of bitcoin's larger problems linger on.",
    "content": "Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.\nBitcoin's Wild West days may be numbered, or so the headlines would have us believe.\nThis week saw the release of the final version of the BitLicense, New York's long-awaited, and still heavily debated, state-specific regulation for bitcoin businesses. Unsurprisingly, the news was extensively covered in the media, and often heralded as a milestone in the evolution of the emerging technology.\nMany stories used legitimizing language and headlines that foreshadowed that bitcoin had taken yet another step toward inclusion in the wider financial world.\nHowever, the technology's growing pains were still on display this week, as it continued to be associated with illicit Deep Web-based activities and development issues dogged one of its most well-funded startups.\nMilestone legislation\nThe victory lap for the BitLicense came swiftly following its 3rd June release, with the mainstream narrative all but arranged to trumpet the government's stamp of approval.\nThe Wall Street Journal's Michael J Casey wrote a piece, which noted:\nIn the article, Casey quoted Lawsky's statements in which he voiced his belief that the legislation struck the appropriate balance between protecting customers and rooting out illicit activity, while showing commitment to not \"doom promising new technologies before they get out of the cradle\".\n\"Whereas some have questioned why existing money transmission regulations can't be used for virtual currency businesses, Mr Lawsky said those Civil War-era laws simply wouldn't work for digital currency, a technology unlike anything we had ever seen before,\" said Casey.\nMore marginalized were the many dissenting voices who occasionally appeared in such content, arguing that the BitLicense would discourage the same spirit of innovation that propelled the early Internet.\nExtensively covered by Western mainstream media, the news was also picked up by less likely outlets around the world, showcasing the technology's growing appeal abroad.\nKommersant, a Russian Daily, ran a headline which implied bitcoin had been legitimised as a digital currency; a loosely translated version read: \"Cryptocurrency Recognised A Full Part of The Financial Market\".\nThe article said:\nSuch articles could no doubt have an influence on coming conversations regarding regulation that is seeking to ban the technology in Russia under rules for monetary surrogates.\nNail in the bitcoin coffin\nIt wasn't all good news for bitcoin.\nFollowing Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht's life sentence last week, it was not surprising to see how the debate around bitcoin's use in illicit activities was reignited.\nForbes published a piece by Jason Bloomberg in which the author outlined the digital currency's link to the Deep Web.\nHe wrote:\nBacktracking slightly, Bloomberg asked how significant the demise of Silk Road was for bitcoin, noting that this was part of an ongoing debate.\n\"Controversy, however, is nothing new for bitcoin. In fact, it seems the story of this digital currency consists of nothing but controversy,\" he wrote, adding: \"In fact, perhaps the greatest challenge for bitcoin is divining the technology's true purpose. Early innovators often espoused radical Libertarian goals for revolutionising the banking system and with it, the world economy\".\nDespite this, the author proves seemingly negative about bitcoin's performance.\n\"Bitcoin soon became a haven for criminals – not just Silk Road, but any number of money launderers and other shady types who gravitated toward an anonymous, relatively safe method for conducting financial transactions, in particular across national borders,\" he said.\n'Total crypto breakdown'\nElsewhere, Blockchain struggled to right its news narrative, which has been marked by the kinds of security issues that may be alarming given that it closed $30.5m in funding late last year.\nThe Guardian ran a piece with an alarmist headline given the small number of users apparently affected, writing:\nWhether intentional or not, the latter seems to imply that Blockchain's bug could potentially affect bitcoin as a whole, as opposed to just users who store their holdings on Blockchain's wallets.\nWriter Alex Hern explained:\nHe continued: \"The bug affected users running Blockchain’s app on Android version 4.1 or older [...] it resulted in one specific address being generated multiple times, leading to a loss of funds for a handful of users.”\nAccording to Hern, the bug was due to a series of questionable development choices:\nIt seems that Blockchain used two sources to create the random numbers, pulling a random number from Android's built-in generator, and then connecting to online service Random.org to obtain the second combination.\nHern noted that on some Android devices, the built-in random number generator failed to connect and report back Blockchain's app.\nThen, the battering continued.\nMichael Mimoso wrote a piece for Threat Post with \"Crypto Calamity For Blockchain Android App\" as its headline.\nDescribing Blockchain as one of the busiest bitcoin wallets, the article said: \"Shoddy crypto is being blamed for the loss of bitcoin for an unnamed number of Blockchain users.\"\nIt seems that New York's plans to regulate digital currency companies, at least for now, will do little to help solve the pain points for companies still struggling to gain wider adoption.\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock.",

    "content": "Bitcoin wallet and block explorer provider Blockchain has unveiled its latest Android wallet update, announcing the news at The North American Bitcoin Conference (NABC), an ongoing two-day industry event taking place in downtown Chicago.\nThe official launch follows the release of early previews provided by the company in June, a leak that coincided with Blockchain's debut of its new customer onboarding tool, Bitcoin.com.\nBlockchain CEO Nicolas Cary framed the announcement as part of a broader update to the company's wallet service that will find it issuing more news through the summer. Combined, this initiative will help the company better meet the scale that it excepts as more consumers join the bitcoin ecosystem.\nCary said:\nNotably, the updated Android wallet integrates with user address books and includes an in-app merchant map that can be leveraged to find bitcoin businesses.\nClick below to view a gallery of app images:\nMerchant mapping\nOne of the more novel aspects of the new app is its inclusion of a merchant directory that the company says uses a \"fully verified database\" to let users discover local businesses that accept bitcoin in a similar way as traditional merchant directories such as Yelp.\nImages provided by Blockchain show that in-app business directory pages include the phone number, address and website of bitcoin companies, as well as a description of their services.\nUsers can also search an interactive map that includes five unique, color-coded pins to specify the nature of the business and its services.\nReimagining interaction\nKeonne Rodriguez, Blockchain's product lead, said that the goal with the app redesign was to focus on user experience, and images show that personal finance management services may have influenced the final release.\nFor example, the wallet dashboard allows Android users to see their balance and divide their funds into categories such as \"Vacation\", \"Car\" or \"Savings\" to better manage their finances.\nAdditionally, the wallet will enable peer-to-peer transactions without the recipient needing an existing bitcoin wallet, providing bitcoin users with a way to bring more interested individuals into the ecosystem.\nConference update\nThe announcement followed a Saturday speech by Blockchain COO Peter Smith, who spoke opposite CoinSetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz at the NABC.\nThe event\nalso featured speeches from notable industry leaders such as BitPay senior software engineer Jeff Garzik, OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao and Bitcoin Shop CEO Charles Allen.\nFor more news and breaking announcements, follow CoinDesk's live Twitter coverage of the event.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article stated that the event was attended by OKCoin CEO Star Xu.

    "title": "Venture Capitalists and Bitcoin Companies React to Apple’s Blockchain Ban",
    "summary": "Could Apple's decision to axe the last bitcoin wallet app cause long-term damage to the bitcoin ecosystem?",
    "content": "News that Apple had pulled the Blockchain.info app from its App Store broke in the early hours of this morning (UK-time) and the short-term effect seemed to be a dip in the price of bitcoin.\nAt midnight (GMT), the price was $822. Some 15 minutes later, Blockchain tweeted its response to Apple's decision and, over the course of the next hour, the bitcoin price fell to $793. By 08:30, the price had fallen to $783.04, the lowest it has been since 2nd January.\nAt the time of writing, the price is back up to $802, but this is still 8% lower than yesterday's high of $874.\nJeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the bitcoin company that raised $9m in funding last year, said he's not convinced the price drop was caused by Apple's actions. He said:\nNic Cary, CEO of Blockchain agreed, adding that any time significant news breaks about bitcoin, the price moves one way or the other. However, he doesn't consider the latest price drop to be an issue.\n\"Bitcoin is extremely resilient. I'm confident the price will rebound quickly. Bitcoin is impervious to Apple's app store policies,\" he said.\nThe effect on VC activity\nCary also doesn't think Apple's decision will have any wider-reaching implications. He certainly doesn't think the move will put a dampener on VC activity in the bitcoin space.\n[post-quote]\n\"VCs understand that Apple's harsh anti-Bitcoin policy is nothing new. Coinbase raised $25 million after their app was yanked last year,\" he said. \"The largest migration of human and financial capital is underway into bitcoin projects and we're just getting started.\"\nJeremy Allaire also doesn't think Venture Capital firms will be put off investing in bitcoin companies because of Apple's harsh stance on digital currency apps.\n\"Quality VC firms are not news-driven in their decisions. Those that are excited about bitcoin are taking a long view and are interested in how the space is going to evolve,\" he said.\nAllaire believes companies can build \"outstanding\" applications that can be used on iOS in a browser and that these can accomplish 99% of what can be done in a native app.\nVC activity in the bitcoin space certainly doesn't appear to be slowing down. Blockchain, BitPay and Bitstamp are all rumoured to be in the process of raising mammoth funding rounds.\nLosing favour\nIt's evident that Apple's actions have lost it a fair few fans over the past 24 hours. Twitter, Reddit and other forums are awash with negative comments aimed at the tech giant.\nBarry Silbert, CEO of Second Market and founder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, voiced his disappointment in a tweet:\n— Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) February 6, 2014\nTwitter user Bitrific was equally disgruntled by the move:\n— B I T R I F I C (@bitrific) February 6, 2014\nEx-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya threw in his two cents' worth, too:\n— Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) February 6, 2014\nCary said his company has received a \"tremendous response\" from the bitcoin community, in the form of hundreds of supportive comments and messages.\nHe went on to stress Blockchain isn't giving up and highlighted that his colleagues have already started engineering an HTML5 app that will launch soon on Blockchain.com.\n\"Of course, users can download our Android app anytime - in fact, it's having a record day. Apple is losing ground across the world and they will find themselves on the wrong side of history here. We'll just leapfrog them,\" Cary concluded.\nEradicating competition\nAllaire speculated that there are two possible reasons why Apple has banned bitcoin wallet apps. The first is conservatism – that the company is fearful of the perceived risk that comes with bitcoin.\nThose on the risk assessment side of Apple's policy team may be looking at the bitcoin-associated federal indictments, law enforcement actions and money laundering stories that are flying around and decide it's safest to steer clear, at least for the time being.\nThe second motive Allaire suggests is that Apple wishes to cordon off and gain a position of advantage in the digital payments space. He said:\nHe doesn't, however, believe the company will launch its own digital currency, just that it will maintain an advantage in digital payments by blocking bitcoin apps that can be used for sending and receiving funds.\nAllaire believes that if this were the case, though, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would step in to prevent Apple from using the App Store to monopolise the market.\n\"There is precedent for this,\" he said. \"When the iPhone came out and Google wanted to launch Google Voice as an app on iOS, Apple banned it and wouldn't approve any voice apps. The FCC then took action.\"\nFor the mean time, Apple is sticking to its guns and making it extremely difficult for bitcoiners to stay loyal to the brand. Something tells me Android is going to see a spike in new users over the coming days.",

    "title": "Apple Removes Blockchain Bitcoin Wallet Apps from its App Stores",
    "summary": "Apple has removed the only remaining bitcoin wallet app from its App Stores, leaving users with plenty of questions.",
    "content": "Apple has removed the Blockchain wallet app from its iOS App Stores, leaving iPhone and iPad users with no native bitcoin wallet options for their devices.\nApple offered no explanation for the action and no option to appeal, other than saying the removal was due to \"an unresolved issue\".\nThe Cupertino company's move did not come as a complete surprise, as Apple had previously banned bitcoin wallet apps Coinbase and CoinJar, and insisted encrypted messaging app Gliph remove an option that allowed users to send bitcoin. CoinJar is still available for download on the local Australian App Store.\nBlockchain\nhad been available on the iOS App Store for over two years, and had been downloaded more than 120,000 times. Its native app for desktops was also removed from the Mac App store, though the slightly more open nature of OS X means users may still download and install this version from non-Apple sources.\nBacklash\nBlockchain\nwas scathing in its criticism of Apple's decision, posting the following statement on its blog:\n\"[The app] had no customer complaints, and a broad user base. The only thing that has changed is that bitcoin has become competitive to Apple’s own payment system. By removing the Blockchain app, the only bitcoin wallet application on the App store, Apple has eliminated competition using their monopolistic position in the market in a heavy handed manner.\"\nAfter its removal of bitcoin wallet apps from its App Stores for often vague reasons, others have also questioned whether Apple might be trying to enter the mobile payment space itself, where bitcoin wallet apps would become its competition.\nEven Coinbase, one of the most popular bitcoin payment processors in the US, had its iOS app blacklisted just three weeks after it launched.\nUsers who previously downloaded bitcoin wallet apps may continue to use them, though updates are not possible and a device reset would see the apps gone forever.\nBlockchain.info\nThe company and team behind the Blockchain app, also called Blockchain, was a one-man operation started by British developer Ben Reeves until the summer of 2013 when the team expanded to accommodate bitcoin's popularity boom. Reeves built the site Blockchain.info initially as an academic research tool to explore bitcoin's public ledger and the secrets it divulged about the curious workings of the bitcoin economy. Since then it has become the most regularly referenced site for anyone examining strange transactions, alleged crime, mistakes, and other obscure anomalies.\nSometimes called \"The Google of bitcoin\", Blockchain's team now consists of 14 people spread around the world on at least three different continents. Its wallet service also grew from humble beginnings as a side project into the world's most popular 'web-assisted' bitcoin storage option, going from 500,000 accounts at the beginning of November 2013 to over a million by the end of the year. The company intends to spin the wallet side of things into a separate commercial entity called Blockchain.com.\nAfter Coinbase's own iOS App Store demise, Blockchain was the only native bitcoin wallet app available to Apple mobile device users. Launched in April 2012, its initial submission was rejected by Apple but the app was allowed into the store after some UI/UX tweaks. Its interface was thus more limited compared to its Android counterpart, but it was stable and had not been updated for iOS7 possibly due to fears that updates would need to be scrutinized again by Apple's approval team and risk a ban. In the end, it seems, Apple decided not to wait.\nBitcoiners abandoning Apple?\nApple's move could see a greater exodus of its bitcoin-using fans away from iOS and towards Google's Android platform, which has several wallet options that continue to be developed and updated to meet bitcoin's increasing popularity.\nKyle Drake, lead developer at Coinpunk.com, is working on a mobile app to run in a browser, eliminating Apple's ability to block it via an App Store ban. Upon hearing the news of Blockchain's fate he issued his own call to action:\nBlockchain's statement continued to question whether Apple was any longer on the side of the rebels and innovators it once claimed as its base.\n\"Unlike Apple, Google has accepted hundreds of bitcoin-related applications even though they also compete against the company’s own payment system 'Google Wallet'.\"\n\"Bitcoin is a revolutionary new peer-to-peer currency and payment system that is empowering millions around the world, especially the unbanked and underbanked who can use it to gain access to international banking facilities with nothing more than a smartphone.\"\n\"Bitcoin’s use for international payments from family members sending money home to support entire communities in the developing world and for charity fundraising and fund distribution will be severely affected by this decision. As of Wednesday, bitcoin is no longer available to those using iOS devices, once again leaving them to the mercy of oppressive currency controls and governments in some of the worst regimes in the world.\"\nThere is also an active petition on Change.org to allow bitcoin wallets to run natively on iOS devices, though whether it would elicit any official response from the notoriously silent Apple is doubtful.\nImage credit: App Store Icon | Robboudon",

    "title": "Bitcoin Startup Blockchain Releases Code for 'Thunder' Payment Channels",
    "summary": "The development of payments channels on the bitcoin network took a step forward today with new technology released by wallet startup Blockchain.",
    "content": "Bitcoin startup Blockchain has released the first version of a payments channel prototype that finds it moving its research efforts into how transactions on the bitcoin network can be made faster and more effective into the public eye.\nThe startup, which has raised $30m in one public round of funding, announced the alpha release of the ThunderNetwork today. Best described as a Blockchain-led effort into the implementation of payment channels, the technology seeks to allow bitcoin users a way to conduct off-blockchain transactions that settle against the bitcoin blockchain at a later date.\nGiven the sometimes high cost of settling against bitcoin’s blockchain, which can fluctuate (sometimes greatly) with demand for block space, the ecosystem has long sought to bridge bitcoin’s ability to be denominated into units as small as one one-hundred-millionth of a bitcoin with the fact that fees to settle such transactions against the blockchain are generally prohibitively higher than such values.\nTo date, the most prominent effort to bring payments channels to the bitcoin network has been the Bitcoin Lightning Network, an open-source project that has since coalesced into a startup called Lightning, which boasts some of the community’s more notable developers.\nStill, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith sought to stress that the announcement represents a significant step forward for the bitcoin network given that the technology is useable at a limited scale today. Further, while spearheaded by Blockchain, he emphasized that ThunderNetwork can now be built on by the wider community of bitcoin developers.\nSmith told CoinDesk:\nIn a demonstration of the network and its capabilities, Blockchain detailed how Smith and ThunderNetwork lead developer Mats Jerratsch tested how the tech can be used for person-to-person transactions.\nThe technology has already received widely positive feedback, with Twitter mentions even from innovators in the private blockchain side of the ecosystem weighing in on the significance of the release.\nThis enthusiasm was palpable in the startup’s announcement of the news, with the company writing:\nComparisons to Lightning Network\nAnnounced last August, the Thunder Network is intended to be a “low-trust solution” to payments channels, one that used mostly tools available to bitcoin developers.\nAt the time\n, lead developer Jerratsch contrasted this with Lightning, which he characterized as a “no trust” way to achieve the same functionality. These differences can be seen in the design of ThunderNetwork released, as Blockchain is the only company that runs nodes on the network.\nNodes will route transactions using encrypted onion routing, with transactions moving through multiple nodes without any information about the individuals involved being disclosed to these entities. “It will go from my node to your node, to another person’s node, the basic routing methodology,” Smith said.\nThe official blog post provided more clarity, indicating that at each hop, the status of the payment will be renegotiated until the channel is closed and ultimately settled.\nIn interview, Smith sought to position ThunderNetwork as something that can work in conjunction with any implementation of payments channel technology for the bitcoin network.\n\"I think it’s complementary to any lightning network,\" he said.\nProtocol changes needed\nPerhaps most notable about the release is that Blockchain still needs a few changes to be made to the bitcoin protocol so that Thunder transactions can settle against the blockchain.\nThe first, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) was recently merged into Bitcoin Core but is awaiting further development as OP_CSV. Secondly, implementing Thunder will require the merging of SegratedWitness, the long in-development scaling solution that would alter how transactions are stored by the bitcoin blockchain.\nToday, Blockchain said the network is \"suited for transactions among a trusted network of users\", while cautioning that it should not be used for real payments.\nAs for how ThunderNetwork fits into Blockchain’s business strategy, Smith was less clear, though its blog post hinted the startup is currently seeking to expand its team of developers.\nSmith concluded:\nThunder clouds image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Complaints Hit 'Record' Levels at Blockchain Amid Confirmation Delays",
    "summary": "Wallet provider Blockchain has released data that indicates its users are complaining more about service disruptions amid increased network demand.",
    "content": "While debate remains over the origin and implications of the rising transaction fees on the bitcoin network last week, the sudden increase in network use appears to be creating pressures for industry businesses.\nTo date, this has mostly manifested in public calls to action by industry CEOs who have taken to blog posts to detail concerns over the current state of the network. Though there’s disagreement on finer points, those wishing to send a bitcoin transaction today are paying higher fees, or else waiting longer to have transactions confirm.\nIn the midst of this development, bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain has released data that indicates its users are issuing more complaints related to service disruptions, providing a window into how bitcoin’s larger consumer-facing businesses are being affected by the network developments.\nBlockchain CEO Peter Smith indicated in a Medium post today that the startup is seeing \"new records\" for support tickets related to \"unconfirmed transactions\", however, it did not go into further detail.\nData provided by Blockchain to CoinDesk indicates that support tickets in this category rose 110% from January to February, a figure that dwarfed a 14% increase observed from December to January.\nBlockchain co-founder Nic Cary said:\nCary went on to state that support tickets are being resolved on average in just over two hours, but that this is putting added pressure on the company’s staff and users.\n\"Many of the of the voices opining on the state of the network and scaling debate do not serve end users and so they don't really know how frustrating it's getting for regular folks trying to make transactions,\" Cary said.\nLarger debate\nStill, just how much pressure this is putting on startup business models, and how much of a concern this should be for developers, remains a contentious topic.\nBlockchain’s figures come at a time when industry leaders are beginning to speak out on the issue following a private industry meeting from 26th to 28th February in which the topic of how best to scale the bitcoin network was discussed.\nConversation about the event was minimal until a controversial post by Coinbase’s Armstrong on Friday in which he criticized Bitcoin Core developers, calling the team overly ideological and immature. He further advocated for a proposal called Bitcoin Classic that would increase the capacity of transactions the bitcoin network would be able to process in each data block to 2MB, up from 1MB today.\nSuch comments set off a firestorm of criticism on social media, inspiring blog posts by developers such as Oleg Andreev, who argued that as the blockchain system with the biggest network effect, bitcoin does not need to rush to add users.\nRather, Andreev argued advances from other blockchain-based systems will simply be added to bitcoin, meaning users are unlikely to adopt another system despite added fees and longer wait times for confirmations.\nHe suggests that the network’s security and integrity should be paramount, and that they should not be risked on short-term gains.\nNetwork pressure subsides\nAgainst this background, data from 21 Inc indicates that the average fee needed for a 30-minute transaction confirmation was in decline on Monday.\nLast Thursday, users needed to pay 60 satoshis per byte for a transaction confirmation time of roughly 30 minutes, a figure that was up slightly from than the 50 satoshis per byte observed at press time.\nData also indicates that the number of blocks that are near capacity or filled to capacity is subsiding after spiking last week.\nAdding further fuel to the debate are allegations that network activity contributing to last week’s transaction surge should be viewed as \"demand\", and that a capacity increase is needed to accommodate users who are being denied service.\nFor example, some observers believe that individuals or entities may be colluding to drive up the number of transactions on the network to sway the ongoing technical debates.\nHowever, Blockchain's data provides evidence that bitcoin’s users are experiencing issues regardless of the root cause.\nCary concluded:\nImage credit: tigristiara / Shutterstock.com",

    "summary": "The Atlantic's New York Ideas conference played host to a debate on the future of bitcoin on 6th May.",
    "content": "Blockchain CEO Nic Cary spoke at New York Ideas – a conference featuring thought leaders in the business, finance and technology industries held by The Atlantic and the Aspen Institute – on 6th May as part of a panel discussion entitled 'Cash, Credit or Digital: What Happened to My Money?\".\nThe panel\nfeatured Cary, Pryor Cashman partner Jeffrey Alberts and McKinsey & Company principal Philip Bruno, and was moderated by NPR Planet Money podcast host David Kestenbaum.\nThe half-hour talk covered a host of current debates in the bitcoin industry, including whether digital currencies are best suited as a payment mechanism, how governments should regulate the industry, and the potential for governments to shut down bitcoin and similar payment methods should they so choose.\nThe most notable comments came from Cary when he was asked if, given the anti-bank sentiment common to bitcoin enthusiasts, he would welcome the entrance of more traditional financial players like Bank of America into the space.\nCary responded that he would \"love if Bank of America got involved in bitcoin\", suggesting that he would like the company to embrace the wider adoption of technology taking place across all industries, stating:\nAlberts has previously represented clients in digital currency disputes and most recently spoke at Inside Bitcoins NYC, while Bruno is known for his expertise in global payments.\nBitcoin as a payment system\nThe conversation kicked off with Kestenbaum sharing his experience trying to buy lunch using bitcoin – one that occurred before the technology's more recent uptick in adoption. The comment sparked debate about bitcoin's potential use as an everyday payment tool.\nThough Cary related his own experiences living entirely by using bitcoin as a currency, Bruno countered that he believes the speculative nature of bitcoin will perhaps be an obstacle that prohibits mainstream users from achieving a similar experience.\nHe cited his belief that most bitcoin transactions are speculative, saying:\nAlberts offered a different take, suggesting that bitcoin's speculative, deflationary nature – although perhaps prohibiting it from becoming a foundational currency – would not be terribly relevant given that bitcoin could evolve to offer a lower-cost back-end to payment providers.\nRegulator interest in bitcoin\nBruno was the most outspoken on the topic of digital currency regulation, suggesting that these institutions are genuinely intrigued by the prospect of a lower-cost payment system:\nOne key benefit that these organisations see potential in, he suggested, was the social impact of a technology that could enable more underbanked consumers to gain access to financial services. Bruno also noted that major financial institutions are \"very serious about studying bitcoin\", though they have not made any commitments to the technology.\nAlberts chose to view the increasing interest in bitcoin among regulators as a sign of the industry's development, while Cary suggested the initial responses from governments – as in the case of the most recent IRS decision on the matter – are a sign more education is needed.\nBitcoin as the new Internet\nOver the course of the conversation, Cary did his best to frame anti-digital currency sentiment as misguided, given the larger transitions happening around the world. He said that those who do so are \"putting [their] head in the sand of the financial future\".\nCary compared bitcoin to email, suggesting that while consumers may not understand it, they will eventually be able to successfully use it to obtain benefits at a lower cost.\nFurther, he indicated that given this long-term appeal, digital currencies are still an attractive investment, saying:\nImage via The Atlantic",

    "content": "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a new white paper on distributed ledger tech.\nThe HKMA, which is Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, produced the paper in partnership with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI).\nThe move comes just over two months after the two sides began collaborating on blockchain applications, a process that has seen activity amongst Hong Kong banks looking to build a system for sharing mortgage valuations.\nThe HKMA is one of a growing body of central banks experimenting with or exploring applications. In the past year, central banks from Russia, Canada and the United Kingdom, among others, have actively tested the tech for uses in the areas of electronic money and document validation.\nThe paper constitutes a broad overview of the tech, offering a top-down look at some of the use cases the HKMA has examined in partnership with ASTRI. Overall, the paper presents blockchain as a tool that “carries enormous potential” depending on the kind of application.\nThough largely striking a positive tone about the tech, the paper’s authors note that, from the regulatory perspective, risks remain. Specifically, the paper highlights the risk of public blockchains being used to launder funds.\n“The possible risks involved in operating such platforms should not be underestimated,” it states. “These may include operational risks, cyber attacks, and money laundering issues.\nLooking ahead\nThe white paper release is only the first step in a wider process, officials in Hong Kong say.\nDuring an event held earlier today, HKMA chief executive Norman Chan said the government is planning further research. ASTRI is looking to publish a follow-up paper sometime in the middle of next year, building on its past findings and exploring “whether some of this work can be put into action”, Chan explained.\nCoinciding with the white paper release is the official launch of a fintech innovation hub, which, according to Chan, will serve as a test bed for continued experimentations between Hong Kong’s financial firms, startup companies and regulators.\n“The Hub is equipped with high-powered computing resources and supported by the experts at ASTRI to allow banks, payment service providers, fintech firms and the HKMA to brainstorm innovative ideas, try out and evaluate new fintech solutions in a safe and efficient manner,” he said.\nChan added that its regulatory sandbox, which hosted the mortgage valuation system trials, is expected to add more financial institutions in the months ahead.\nThe full paper can be found below:\nWhitepaper on Distributed Ledger Technology by CoinDesk on Scribd\nImage via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "New analysis tool 'CoinJoin Sudoku' finds service provides protection only against casual observers, say security consultant and Blockchain.info.",
    "content": "Bitcoin users in need of serious transaction privacy should avoid popular services like Blockchain's SharedCoin and other CoinJoin implementations, according to a well-known security expert.\nBlockchain CEO Nicolas Cary said he was satisfied with the research and the way it was handled:\nCoinJoin Sudoku\nUsing a software tool he created himself called 'CoinJoin Sudoku', Atlas analyzed thousands of transactions identified as using SharedCoin and determined he could identify relationships between specific payments and payees.\nCoinjoin Sudoku\nworks by searching for common ownership of the multiple transaction inputs and outputs that SharedCoin uses to obscure identity, grouping them where ingoing and outgoing amounts match.\nBlockchain\nhas responded to the warning with a blog post reminding customers that SharedCoin and CoinJoin offer protection only against \"casual observers\".\nHow SharedCoin works\nBlockchain.info's\nWhile transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are open for all to see (at least at the public address level), SharedCoin will collect a group of users wishing to increase privacy and join their transactions into one 'master transaction' before broadcasting it to the network.\nThe transaction that then appears on the blockchain would have multiple outputs and inputs, supposedly making it worthless for analysis.\nCustomers may select the number of times to repeat the SharedCoin process, between two and ten.\nWhile offering enhanced privacy to users, SharedCoin and mixing services hope to better protect all users by making the bitcoin blockchain overall a less dependable tool for connecting bitcoin addresses to individuals.\nNeed for privacy\nBlockchain officially began offering SharedCoin as a free service to its users last November, around the time Matt Mellon's 'CoinValidation' and other services appeared, which promised to track specific bitcoins and addresses connected to suspicious or other investigation-worthy activity. It did not claim, however, to provide 100% protection from such services.\nOlder style mixing tools (also known as 'tumblers') would forward a payment around several different addresses to make the originator hard to find, usually on a private server, or 'off-chain'. Such systems, however, required trust from users that anonymous operators would not simply confiscate or steal the bitcoins before they emerged from the mixer.\nSharedCoin, and the CoinJoin protocol itself, provided a system that required less trust in the operator, by taking advantage of a bitcoin transaction's ability to have multiple inputs and outputs.\nCrunching through transactions\nAtlas analyzed 20,000 transactions across 45 blocks on the bitcoin block chain and found around 2.6% fit the profile of a SharedCoin transaction.\nCoinJoin Sudoku identified groups within a transaction with equal amounts (marked red and blue in the diagram below) then examined inputs and outputs one digit at a time to identify possible relationships.\nCurrently, he wrote, the new tool is still inefficient and required over 30 hours to complete the analysis on a single processor, even with testing limitations he introduced. More thorough de-anonymization would take much longer, though it remained possible.\nThrough this kind of grouping, he could identify a maximum of two users within that transaction.\nAtlas recommended anyone using SharedCoin set the number of cycles to the maximum 10, while remembering that even this did not guarantee 100% privacy.\nTaint\nBlockchain provides a 'Taint Analysis' tool to test traceability of funds and is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of mixers. If it works, users should not be able to identify sending addresses in the list.\nAtlas says the Taint Analysis is a \"poor measurement\" for this, identifying a 100% and 50% chance of relationship between an output and two inputs, where the Taint Analysis had claimed 4.2% and 4.5% respectively.\nHe plans to release CoinJoin Sudoku as an open-source project in two weeks. The delay, he said, was to provide SharedCoin users with adequate time to take the steps necessary to protect their privacy.\nBlockchain response\nBlockchain disclosed that it paid Atlas a bounty (via SharedCoin) for finding the vulnerability and had worked with him to coordinate a schedule to release the information:\n\"As always, Blockchain.info is committed to transparency, the community, and improving bitcoin services for everyone.\"\nThe company invited everyone to visit its GitHub repository to review its many open-source projects.\nBlockchain saw SharedCoin's primary user base as corporations wishing to protect privacy of payroll and bill payments, individuals wishing not to display records of salaries or tips, and political and charitable organizations protecting their donors.\nSharedCoin, Blockchain says, is actually \"not a mixing service\" as it never controls or sends any funds on behalf of its users.\nRepeating a warning often given to anyone who claims the bitcoin payment network is 'anonymous', the company said anyone with sufficient time, money, motivation and computing power could correlate transaction outputs and inputs.\nImage via igor.stevanovic / Shutterstock",

    "content": "UPDATE 25th November, 12:16 GMT: We contacted Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič to ask whether there was any truth in the rumour that the transaction was made by his company, but he declined to comment.\nBitcoin internet hangouts were buzzing today after noticing someone had shifted 194,993 BTC (over $147m on CoinDesk's BPI) in one transaction.\nThe transaction, tagged \"Shit Load of Money!\" by its mystery originator*, appeared on Blockchain.info early in the evening of 22nd November. It is one of the largest transactions in bitcoin's history, by far the largest under bitcoin's recent high prices, and represents 1.6% of all bitcoins now in circulation. (*Correction: as pointed out in the comments below, the tag was attached to the receiving address and not by the originator.)\nBitcoin's distributed nature ensures all transactions are visible on the public record, though users are identified only by 30+ character addresses (and any tags they choose to add). If the address is not already known and the user does not identify themselves in an obvious way, they remain anonymous without analysis or detective work.\nUnsurprisingly, a transaction of that size has prompted the bitcoin community to do some analysis and detective work. The transaction involved a large number of sending addresses, with some of them from blocks mined in February 2010 or even earlier, prompting excited speculation they might be from Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin's absent (and likely pseudonymous) founder.\nOr was it Richard Branson, who caused his own digital currency frenzy today by announcing his company Virgin Galactic would accept payment in bitcoin?\nSatoshi Nakamoto is unlikely to reveal him/herself in such an ostentatious manner, and early coins may have changed hands several times. More possibly the lucky owner is a miner from bitcoin's early days, or a business moving the amount to a more secure form of physical storage. The Washington Post's detective work, done by a researcher into how much block chain information may reveal about users, speculated the transaction might be exchange Bitstamp moving its own funds between addresses.\nWhile 194,993 BTC was moved, it's important to note it has not been exchanged for any fiat currency... that we know of. 'Dumping' such a large amount at once would probably have a negative impact on bitcoin's value.\nOn the bitcointalk forums, some users were less interested in the owners' identity and more impressed by the infrastructure that allowed such an amount to be transferred without any regulatory hindrance, lawyers, or fees (the user paid no transaction fee at all). Even handing over that amount in hard cash would be a logistical challenge.\n\"Beautiful, so effortless to move so much money... I'm sometimes involved with very large cross-border transactions and the logistics of making payments of this size are, more often that not, a complete PITA, with timezones and banking hours getting in the way,\" wrote user runam0k.\nImage credit: Timothy OLeary",

    "summary": "A new wave of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges that exist almost entirely on a blockchain could do away with middlemen.",
    "content": "Newcomers to blockchain may notice the irony – in an industry obsessed with decentralization, some of the biggest startups are centralized, trusted institutions.\nBut while it's true today that single entities are most responsible for the operation of exchanges that allow traditional money to be traded for cryptocurrency, some of the industry's oldest startups are now showing an interest in migrating to a future more in line with the spirit of the technology.\nForcing this narrative is a new wave of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges that exist almost entirely on a blockchain, and that can dispense with the need for a third-party intermediary.\n\"Decentralized exchanges are clearly the way of the future,\" said Hugh Madden, technical director for openANX, a decentralized exchange infrastructure protocol.\nMadden argues that a change in industry business models is inevitable as current designs are a target for hackers, and indeed the still-brief history of cryptocurrencies already includes several examples, most famously, Mt Gox.\nFurthermore, if a centralized exchange operates in a jurisdiction without strong regulatory oversight, the operational and financial transparency of the operation can be limited. And with many such exchanges, customer coins are not technically possessed by the customer until they are withdrawn.\nWith decentralized exchanges, each customer's buy and sell orders are directly matched, sometimes without an order book entirely.\nMichael Oved, co-founder of the decentralized exchange Swap, told CoinDesk:\nNew models\nSo, what's different about decentralized exchanges like Swap?\nFor one, it does not have an order book – buy and sell orders are matched completely peer-to-peer. Swap also doesn't charge fees for its service, financing the platform instead from the sale of tokens customers must purchase to use Swap. (These are more analogous to a one-time licensing fee.)\nOpenANX and Swap, as well as 0x and Bancor, are among the newer decentralized exchanges, though there have been other attempts.\nSwitzerland-based ShapeShift has been in operation since 2014, and according to its CEO, Erik Voorhees, it now processes more than 15,000 customer orders each day for a total daily average of between $10m and $15m.\nMeanwhile, centralized exchanges are continuing to develop their offerings, including wallet and brokerage services, as their customer bases swell due to skyrocketing cryptocurrency prices.\nStill, while the decentralized models may lack in ease of use, they have advantages in other areas. The nascent market may already be more competitive, as newcomers are able to operate without the tight regulatory oversight of their peers.\nThe advantage is obvious, even to established startups.\n\"Decentralized exchanges are complementary to and important for the development of the ecosystem by acting as a middle ground,\" said Megan Hernbroth, a communications representative for Coinbase.\nAlthough, she noted that, today, there are advantages in centralized exchanges:\nA compromise\nYet, it remains to be seen how quickly high-tech solutions will pervade the market.\nThe major impediment to the growth of decentralized exchanges is that they cannot currently exchange cryptocurrencies with fiat currencies; they can only transact between different cryptocurrencies, which allows them to avoid anti-money laundering regulations, among other requirements.\nRelatedly, a lack of liquidity is another issue that can plague decentralized exchanges. Specific to Bancor, its business model was very publicly criticized recently by Emin Gün Sirer, co-director of Cornell University's Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (Bancor strongly refutes the assertions).\nIn a recent blog, Peter Smith, CEO of wallet provider Blockchain, lamented the tradeoffs between the two main types of exchange.\n\"While there are a proliferation of decentralized exchange projects, they focus on pure crypto-to-crypto and are far from practical as end-to-end solutions at this point in time. Real-world banking, compliance and AML is simply not attractive to a small team of highly technical engineers,\" he said.\nBut Smith, too, sees the potential, writing:\nFuture outlook\nIn between now and this bright future, decentralized exchanges are innovating apace. ShapeShift recently launched a product called Prism, which allows customers to build portfolios that track baskets of cryptocurrencies.\nAnd openANX believes it has solved the problem of converting to fiat entirely.\nUnder its model, centralized exchanges in various jurisdictions would tokenize real-world assets, which would then be traded in a decentralized manner with openANX’s help.\nMadden called the largest centralized exchanges \"systemic risks\" to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem as they exist now. He envisions a future in which centralized exchanges still operate, but are focused almost entirely on navigating jurisdictional issues like banking relationships and regulation.\nEven ShapeShift's Voorhees believes these models will co-exist.\nHe wrote in a recent Reddit AMA:\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and ShapeShift.\nDNA sequence image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Several industry heavyweights have responded harshly to Mt. Gox's official explanation for its suspension of bitcoin withdrawals.",
    "content": "Following Mt. Gox's decision to abruptly suspend all bitcoin withdrawals on 7th February, many industry commentators and observers, CoinDesk included, began to feel the writing was on the wall for bitcoin's first and once-largest exchange.\nBut, despite the results of our extensive reader survey and critiques from industry heavyweights like Andreas Antonopoulos, there were those who maintained that given its industry reputation, the company's critics may have been premature in their statements.\nHowever, Mt. Gox's future may be even more uncertain after controversial statements issued Monday further damaged the company's reputation and industry standing.\nThe comments, which blamed inherent problems with the bitcoin protocol for the withdrawal delays, ignited a veritable firestorm of anger on message boards, much of which was directed at Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.\nKarpeles' critics alleged he failed to take responsibility for his exchange's technical failures and management limitations. A swift rebuke from other industry thought leaders soon followed, with many saying that Mt. Gox was being deceptive by blaming previously known issues for its delays.\nAt press time, the Bitcoin Foundation has not responded to requests for clarification regarding Karpeles' standing within the organization.\nRegardless, some industry observers believe that the intent of the statements may not matter.\nBoston University professor Mark T. Williams\nsuggested that there will be little Mt. Gox can do to stem the damage. Speaking more broadly of virtual currency companies in a still developing market, he said:\nThe bitcoin community reacts\nFollowing the announcement, the Bitcoin Foundation moved to contradict Mt. Gox and Karpeles' statements, though it did recognize the underlying problem of transaction malleability they cited has still yet to be completely fixed.\nThe Foundation said in a press release:\nEven controversial members of the bitcoin community, such as BitInstant's former CEO Charlie Shrem, called for Karpeles to step down from the organization:\nSome community members alleged that the comments were meant to buoy confidence in Mt. Gox's service, not harm the community, while others went so far as to suggest that the exchange intentionally crashed prices in an attempt to profit from a later recovery.\nBitcoin developers calm user concerns\nThe development community also distanced itself from Mt. Gox's statements, downplaying the severity of its claims. Bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell suggested that Mt. Gox was spinning the news to its own benefit, but provided evidence that the problems the company addressed are not only real, but that they may take a long time for developers to address.\nAndreas Antonopoulos, Blockchain's chief security officer, moved to calm its users about the issue as well, calling the problem a \"known implementation issue\" that would not affect users of its bitcoin wallets.\nBitcoin exchanges weigh in\nThe leaders of other major exchanges were quickly besieged with requests for comments on the ongoing drama, and all downplayed concerns. Leon Li, CEO and founder of China-based Huobi, shared his views with Forex Magnates, suggesting that Mt. Gox was presenting the problem as larger than necessary.\n\"Wallets sometimes experience small technical problems, but all of them can be fixed and thus won’t cause large-scale withdrawal problems,\" he said.\nJesse Heaslip\n, CEO of Bex.io, the maker of white-label bitcoin exchange software, told CoinDesk that Mt. Gox's technical limitations were the cause of the issues:\nJaron Lukasiewicz\n, CTO at New York-based forex trading platform Coinsetter, told CoinDesk that he agrees with the official response from the Bitcoin Foundation:\nRich Teo, CEO at itBit, said: “Recently, at least one bitcoin exchange has found a flaw in the way they watched transactions on the block chain. This is not a problem with bitcoin or the Bitcoin software, but the way the exchange was watching the transaction for completeness.”\n“itBit does not watch transactions in this way, and malleability of transactions does not affect deposits or withdrawals at itBit,” he added.\nMajor bitcoin indexes remove Mt. Gox\nThe reaction from major bitcoin price indexes may have been the most damaging to Mt. Gox, as the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index was far from the only major price tracker to swiftly remove the once once-dominant exchange from its offerings.\nCryptocoin charts not only barred Mt. Gox from its charts and orderbooks, but offered a reprimand of its actions:\nBitcoinAverage announced its removal of the service via GitHub and Twitter.\n— BitcoinAverage (@BitcoinAverage) February 10, 2014\nA history of turbulence\nWhile the future of Mt. Gox remains uncertain, what is more clear is that this is just the latest setback for a major company that once saw 80% of all trading activity occur on its platform.\nFor a detailed history of Mt. Gox's ups and downs, view our complete timeline here.\nImage credit: Angry businessman via Shutterstock",

Blockchain also acquired multi-exchange bitcoin trading platform ZeroBlock earlier this year.\nCary was a keynote speaker on day one of Inside Bitcoins NYC this month, where he discussed the potential global impact of the technology. There, CoinDesk spoke to Cary about recent developments at Blockchain, how it aims to hold off competition in the market and what it learned from its high-profile service outage in March.\nCoinDesk: Blockchain has accomplished a lot in a short time, operating successfully in three different business sectors. How are you aiming to take your company forward in 2014?\nNic Cary: We're going to launch Blockchain.com as the main consumer-facing wallet site. Our intention for doing that is to spend a lot more time on the user experience and making bitcoin more familiar to regular users.\nBlockchain.info sort of set one design standard for what a bitcoin wallet could look like, and its been copied a lot, and we have to keep making bitcoin easier.

Everything has to get easier, from the signup process to acquiring bitcoins to figuring out where to spend them to inviting friends to the education of bitcoin itself.\nToo many times the conversation of how to set up a wallet starts at a table like this where you sit down across from someone and say that 'I need 30 minutes of your time to learn why this is the most important thing you're going to hear about for the next few months.' That conversation has to get easier.\nBlockchain is an established player in an ecosystem that's very much still growing. Are you worried about competition, especially in foreign markets with this approach?\nNic Cary: We're watching the competitive developments in the landscape carefully, but we're not obsessing about them. This is very early, there's a lot of upside for everyone. I don't think we'll bat 1.000 across everything, but when you think about how these other companies are building their products, you need to think about the innovation. Are they actually innovative or did they just build a new bank?\nWhether you're talking about Mt. Gox or any of the other businesses that had security issues, what you're talking about is a company that held custody and control over user funds and had access to information about their customers.\nThere are two approaches, you can centralise everything and build a new PayPal for bitcoin, or you can embrace the peer-to-peer network and create technologies that basically cut out the trust in the products and the services at all and allow people to directly interface in the bitcoin network, that's our marketing and that's our position.\nWe do not have custodial accounts. That's the biggest difference between us and all the other big players, including Circle, Coinbase, Bitstamp, all the exchanges, they all have centralised control over bitcoins.\nBut this isn't a zero-sum game, there isn't one solution that's going to win out.\nDo you think there's a disadvantage in taking a one-size-fits-all approach to not taking into account localization when building your product?\nNic Cary: For managing our brand, it's going to be challenging to have really localized solutions. I anticipate and expect the wallet market will fragment quite a bit in 2014. I think you'll see companies build solutions for specific countries and specific use cases.\nI could see a wallet service that lives on cell phones and has parental controls, and if a kid leaves a certain region it deducts $5 from the wallet, or it notifies the parent that they spent the funds. I don't have an interest in building these solutions, what we're interested in is providing the piping in the background for it.\nMany of the major exchanges and wallets are still using our APIs to broadcast to the bitcoin network and we provide all these services for free.\nWe hope that lots of people build sweet wallet solutions for whatever country they're in, I'd like it if they used Blockchain's APIs but all of our stuff is basically open-source anyway so they could copy it if they want to.\nYou recently went through a high-profile outage. What did Blockchain learn from this, and what did you learn as its CEO?\nAny time you have growing pains, you're going to need to make new investments in your infrastructure. Because we take extreme care for the security of our services, we don't trust other parties to build things, but that means you have to develop in-house expertise on really complicated server infrastructures.\nNo one can predict how fast bitcoin adoption is going to happen. This has huge costs for companies like mine, especially because we're a free service. We didn't know how fast things would happen in November, we were behind in adding infrastructure, we made a bunch of investments and we're still making investments in anticipating a greater adoption of bitcoin in the future.\nFor us, the lesson is that when you're having a problem you have to communicate with people, it's completely unforgivable to not be transparent about the issues that are happening.\nWe have to get better, and it was intolerably to me to have that happen. We're going to keep learning from it.\nDo you see your company as a leader in the space?\nI think for us, we take the trust of our users so incredibly seriously. You just can't screw that up. I hope that we can be known as being trustworthy and to build a brand around Blockchain that is enduring. I don't want to be thought of as the PayPal for bitcoin, or Google.\nI just want to be Blockchain, that's us. It means that we take care of our users, that we're transparent, that we build open-source software, that you can trust the math and the code and that we'll put it all out there for everybody to see.\nDo you see yourself as a leader in the space?\nMy focus is on building products and services and finding teammates that deserve each other to make Blockchain a happy place. I see myself as the CEO of Blockchain first before any other type of figurehead in any way shape or form.\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nImage via LinkedIn",

Those carve-outs cover law enforcement officials, sellers who use a distributed ledger or similar technology to report sales to the state, and firearm owners who have provided written consent to have their weapons tracked on a ledger.\nSchroer's bill was also careful to differentiate between electronic firearm tracking technologies, which refer to distributed ledgers or other decentralized databases, and official law enforcement tracking systems like the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) database.\nIf passed, the bill states that anyone who illegally tracks firearms on a blockchain could be found guilty of a Class E felony. Class E felonies are the least severe of Missouri felonies and can be punishable by up to four years in jail, according to law firm Carver Cantin Mynarich, LLC.\nNotably, the Missouri bill nearly identical to one signed into law in Arizona in February, which also makes it illegal to track firearms on a blockchain unless the user is in an exempted category (that measure, too, includes carve-outs for law enforcement and the like). That bill was signed less than a month after it was first introduced in mid-January.\nGuns image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Apple is making good on its recent bitcoin policy shift, with a new bitcoin wallet app appearing for download in the iOS App Store.\nThe 'Coinpocket' app is described by its developer as a wrapper for a previously available open source HTML5 version, this time with full access to the camera hardware for QR code scanning.\nWhile its feature set is fairly basic, Coinpocket allows users to do anything they could do on previously-available iPhone wallet apps like Coinbase and Blockchain, which had gone some time without updates before being subsequently removed from the store.\nThe company updated its policy last week to include 'approved' digital currencies.\nFeatures\nThe new app does offer a function that allows the user to 'sweep' funds into wallet from a private key – useful for quick transfers of BTC – along with the ability to generate a BIP38 encrypted version of the private key (although this can take a long time, with some reddit users reporting crashes).\nOtherwise, Coinpocket offers simple send and receive functions and three different sources for current bitcoin price information.\nWith Apple now approving bitcoin wallets, the race is on for developers to create and submit more fully-featured apps for the mobile OS that still has a significant market share in some of the world's richest markets.\nUsers of previously popular apps, like Blockchain's which was downloaded over 120,000 times before being blocked, will now look forward to updates bringing their functionality closer to that of their Android cousins.\nIn-app bitcoin purchases\nIt's not just wallet apps finding new approval from Apple; others have appeared that allow bitcoin purchases from within the app, which also appear to avoid Apple's 30% share of all in-app purchase amounts rule.\nThe eGifter app, for example, now allows users to purchase its gift cards directly with bitcoin, making the dream of spending bitcoin on Walmart purchases via an iOS device – impossible just a week or so ago – a reality.\nThe first iOS app to allow in-app bitcoin spending was the simple betting game Betcoin, which appeared almost immediately after Apple's announcement. Its developer, Omri Cohen, said it was partly an experiment to test what Apple would allow, and was actually submitted before Apple's change of heart to a more favorable bitcoin attitude.\nImage via bloomua / Shutterstock",

For example, the Blockchain wallet app was removed from Apple's app stores in February.\nStill, Held said he is optimistic that Apple will host the platform.\nMore to come\nIn the official release, ZeroBlock was enthusiastic about adding Clark to the team, lauding his development of the RTBTC platform. Further, CEO Nicolas Cary praised Moody, calling him a pioneer and visionary in the bitcoin economy.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Held talked further about Clark's involvement with ZeroBlock, and what customers can expect from the partnership.\nHeld said he is eager to develop his working relationship with Clark, but did not disclose additional details about any planned products.\nThe official release did however offer a teaser, promising \"exciting new features are coming\" to the trading platform, including support for additional exchanges.",

    "summary": "Last week, wallet provider Blockchain represented the bitcoin industry in an official government trade mission.",
    "content": "Last week, wallet provider Blockchain represented the bitcoin industry in an official government trade mission.\nCEO Peter Smith was one of 31 executives to take part in a trade delegation, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, to promote the UK's FinTech businesses in Southeast Asia.\nThe FinTech sector, which now employs 135,000 people in the UK and creates $20bn in annual revenue, is a key part of the Conservative Party's plan to stimulate trade and investment.\nWhile the nation received 42% of Europe's FinTech investment last year, trade body Innovate Finance wants to capture an even greater share of a market still dominated by Silicon Valley and predicted to be worth $46bn by 2020.\nCameron's trade mission coincided with the release of the organisation's 'UK 2020' manifesto which calls for the nation to create over 25 FinTech leaders \"whether by IPO, global market share or by valuation\".\nAlongside the key players in the FinTech ecosystem, Innovate Finance also counts bitcoin firms Bitreserve, CoinFloor and Elliptic as members. Elliptic joined several other FinTech startups on a previous trade mission to America with London Mayor Boris Johnson.\nChampioning business\nThe Treasury's newly appointed 'special envoy' for FinTech, Eileen Burbidge, is a partner at VC firm Passion Capital, one of the backers behind UK exchange CoinFloor.\nThough the government has mentioned bitcoin and blockchain technology in its rhetoric to date, Smith's invitation is more concrete evidence it is championing bitcoin businesses as part of its agenda.\nSmith told CoinDesk:\nThe CEO said he was \"honoured\" to be part of the mission around Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia.\n\"The highlight was having the chance to explain bitcoin, and our company, to the Prime Minister while we flew between cities,\" he added.\nAlongside SMEs such as RateSetter and Earthport, others in attendance included FTSE-100 insurance company Aviva and Rolls Royce, who signed a £340m deal with Vietnam Airlines during the mission.\nThough many of the delegates in attendance had heard of bitcoin, their understanding was limited, Smith said. One of the biggest take-aways from the trip, he said, was the need for better education – which can be something as simple as setting up a bitcoin wallet and receiving funds.\nNewest @Blockchain user! setup @AirAsia founder @tonyfernandes with his first #bitcoin wallet. Cool things coming :) pic.twitter.com/LoXGNpvelz\n— Peter Smith (@OneMorePeter) July 30, 2015\nStimulating the economy\nIn the year since withdrawing his first bitcoin from a bitcoin ATM, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osbourne announced a landmark plan to regulate digital currencies in the UK.\nUnder the proposed laws, bitcoin exchanges in the country will be required to adhere to anti-money laundering regulations, meanwhile companies will be able to opt in to consumer protection standards, coordinated with the help of the UKDCA and the British Standards Institution (BSI).\nThe government is also investing $10m into research on digital currencies, in a joint venture between Research Councils, the Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult.\nUnlike New York's \"inflexible\" BitLicense, startups have praised the UK's measures for their light touch. The FCA's regulatory sandbox has proven particularly useful for many startups who cannot afford up-front compliance costs.\nIn a previous interview, Marco Santori, global policy counsel at Blockchain said:\nThe government's formal consultation on digital currencies is expected to begin this summer.",

    "summary": "Blockchain Merchant is a new payments app designed specifically for merchants and built around the Blockchain API.",
    "content": "Blockchain.info has launched a new payments app designed specifically for merchants. Blockchain is by far the most popular bitcoin wallet and just two months ago the company reached its one million milestone.\nHowever, its new offering is a very different beast. The Blockchain Merchant app is designed to allow merchants to accept bitcoin payments at practically any retail location. The app integrates with your wallet and it can be set up to receive payments in a few easy steps.\nNic Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info, explained: \"Merchant adoption is something we are very passionate about. We want to build beautiful, simple to use applications for anyone to get started with Bitcoin.\"\nEasy as 1,2,3\nOnce the app is installed the user needs to add the receiving address, business name and currency of choice. The user then enters a description and price for items being purchased and the app generates a QR code, allowing the customer to scan it and send the payment.\nAs Blockchain.info explains:\nHow does it compare?\nSo what are the selling points? Well, since the app is free, they aren't exactly selling points, but Blockchain says it has a number of advantages over traditional payment methods and competing bitcoin solutions.\nAs soon as it is installed and set up, the app can start receiving bitcoin payments instantly via the Blockchain API. There are no fees on payments and the app is already getting good reviews on Google Play. The biggest complaint coming from early adopters and reviewers appears to be the relatively limited choice of currencies.\nThe application should run on all Android devices running Android 4.0 or a more recent versions.\nOf course, the elephant in the room is Coinbase. The company pioneered bitcoin merchant apps, but truth be told bitcoin merchant apps are still very niche. The Coinbase Merchant app still has fewer than 5,000 downloads, which doesn't sound like much – and it isn't.\nBitcoin POS (point of sale) and mPOS (mobile point of sale) solutions are still few and far between, but in theory they do offer a number of distinct advantages over traditional payment solutions, including the fact that they are free, offer 0% transaction fees and don't require specialized hardware.\nApple is still not allowing bitcoin apps on iOS, which is bad news for many merchants who rely on iOS POS solutions, usually on iPads.\nHowever, Cary has a plan: “We're going to be giving away android tablets as we roll it out around the world. There are already half a dozen on the way to Paris and we'll announce new launch cities over the coming weeks.\"\nCafe image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Day one of the North American Bitcoin Conference included major announcements from Blockchain, OKCoin and more.",
    "content": "Day one of the North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago kicked off with the surprise debut of the Digital Chamber of Commerce plus a new bitcoin-focused lobbying group that will seek to advocate for bitcoin in Washington – and it didn't hold back from there.\nPacking a diverse lineup of speakers and a loose community feel, the day saw no shortage of major announcements, including Blockchain's release of its new Android wallet app and OKCoin's announcement that it will soon offer USD deposits and withdrawals.\nHowever, the most pervasive topic of the day was not any of these big moves by industry heavyweights or promising newcomers, but the fierce debate over New York's proposed regulations for bitcoin businesses released this week.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, TNABC organiser Moe Levin suggested that it was intentional for the conference to address regulation, saying:\nThough the topic was discussed on several panels, it was perhaps the day's final roundtable discussion – featuring prominent bitcoin lawyer Marco Santori, Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck and Texas Congressman Steve Stockman – that best illustrated the community's outrage at many of the specific rules the proposal would enforce.\nThere, the panelists largely sought to frame the regulation as a reactionary move that would threaten the ability of bitcoin to develop as freely as the Internet did two decades ago. Santori added that he fears the majority of the proposed rules would be passed, but he didn't rule out that a strong reaction from the bitcoin community could impact this outcome.\nAdditional first day speeches included talks from litecoin creator Charlie Lee and investor Trace Mayer, among others.\nRegulation dampens VC spirits\nIn its late morning slot, the TNABC's VC panel showcased a number of big names from major investment firms, including Tally Capital's Matthew Roszak; Future Ventures' Alyse Killeen; Cryptocurrency Partners' Brock Pierce, and others.\nAt the session, panelists debated how quickly the bitcoin industry was likely to grow, whether enabling direct bitcoin investments would help nurture digital currency startups, and how entrepreneurs could best ensure their ideas were greeted favorably by VCs.\nStill, it was regulation that took center stage when the topic of New York's proposed BitLicenses arose. Notably, CrossPacific Capital Partners managing partner Marc Van Der Chijs indicated that the proposal is enough for him to consider avoiding investments in US companies due to their high capital needs.\nEven if clarifying regulation is not forthcoming, however, Roszak's introductory remarks suggested that the VC community, or at least the more enterprising representatives assembled, would still be actively engaged in digital currency even if New York's regulation proposal passed with many of its provisions intact.\nPayPal speaks out\nPerhaps one of the most surprising moments of the show was when, in a break from the schedule, PayPal corporate strategist Roman Leal addressed the crowd with a representative from the Blockchain team.\nThere, Leal indicated he would be open to working with Blockchain and that bitcoin could even be leveraged to help PayPal improve its recently acquired payments gateway, Braintree.\nLeal, who authored an earlier bitcoin report for Goldman Sachs before joining PayPal in May, added that PayPal wants to engage with the digital currency community, but that it still has reservations about the decision – ones that could block any immediate action.\nCiting the lingering regulatory uncertainty hanging over the industry, Leal suggested it could be five to 10 years before PayPal begins working with bitcoin, depending on when this roadblock is resolved. However, Leal suggests as regulation becomes more certain, companies like PayPal will begin to seek out bitcoin projects, saying:\nHuobi hits US conference circuit\nWhile Huobi proved a unique addition to the event's lineup, the company's speech passed with less fanfare than the later presentation by OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao.\nBy comparison, Huobi's slot was absent any large announcements about its operations. Filling in for Huobi CEO Leon Li, who was originally slated to appear at the conference, was Wendy Wang, who proceeded to provide a broad overview of the Chinese bitcoin market that focused on introducing attendees to the ecosystem's major players and honing in on statistics that illustrated those points.\nOKCoin CEO Star Xu was also slated to appear before he was replaced by Zhao, meaning neither company's CEO succeeded in making their US conference debut.\nInternational exhibitors show off\nThe conference's international feel was also on full display in the exhibition section, with a number of notable industry companies from outside the US installing booths in order to introduce their products to American business owners and consumers.\nBooth displays included those by major digital currency exchanges such as Beijing-based Huobi and OKCoin plus bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitOcean, which has launched a bid to purchase the remaining assets of now-defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.\nAlso in attendance were consumer mining equipment manufacturer Butterfly Labs, merchant processor BitPay and block explorer and wallet provider Blockchain.\nInterior images via CoinDesk Chicago skyline via Shutterstock",

HackerOne partners with corporations interested in shoring up potential security vulnerabilities. Across 1,800 total relationships and eight years, though, it's never before kicked a partner out, said representative Samantha Spielman.\nThe news was first reported Monday by CyberScoop.\nSpielman said Voatz’ breach of “partnership standards” made the relationship unviable, despite the program’s past bug-hunting successes.\n“As a platform, we work tirelessly to foster that mutually beneficial relationship between security teams and the researcher community,” she said. Spielman declined to elaborate on Voatz’ standards breach.\nVoatz told CoinDesk in a statement it regrets the relationship’s “temporary pause.” It said that HackerOne had caved to a “small group of researchers who, along with a few other members of the community, believe Voatz reported a researcher to the FBI.”\n“This falsehood and misinformation has been a source of animosity toward Voatz and our partners, who face consistent attacks from these researchers,” the statement said.\nWest Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner said in October 2019 the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating an attempted breach of the app during a pilot program in 2018. West Virginia has used the app in multiple pilots, and Warner maintains that no votes have been altered to date.\nRocky year\nVoatz came under the spotlight in mid-February when a group of MIT researchers released a scathing write-up highlighting myriad apparent security flaws in the app. They alleged Voatz was essentially bunk, criticized its transparency and called up election officials considering the app to maybe think twice.\nVoatz responded with its own criticism. In a sarcasm-laced Feb. 13 press release, it called the researchers’ report unfair and their “bad faith recommendations” irreparably flawed.\nHowever, earlier this month Trail of Bits published a report supporting the MIT researchers' claims. Voatz had commissioned Trail of Bits to analyze its platform.\nVoatz began working with HackerOne in August 2018 and has paid out over $6,000 to researchers through “HackerOne and other avenues” since. It plans to announce its own bounty program “in the coming days.”\nWest Virginia has dropped its partnership with the company.",

Together with New America, my organization, we're going to be working together to tackle the very tough challenge of tax around the world,” he said. “Tax, obviously, is on its face about the most boring topic imaginable, but it turns out that it powers many of the most fundamental elements of our lives.”\nTillemann and his team are looking to make tax systems more efficient, transparent and accountable.\n“So we're working on three big challenges. First, how do we make it simpler and more fair to get taxes from citizens and companies into government? That's a big struggle in many countries. So how do we simplify that process and create a fair playing field where everybody is paying what they should and [not] more than they should?” he said. “The second piece of this is how do we ensure that once those resources are inside the government, they're used effectively? And then the last piece of this is how we engage in the storytelling work around this effort to make it all understandable and coherent for citizens and corporate partners. It's a lot of work.”\nTillemann sees taxes as a cornerstone of civilization.\n“The [U.S.] Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said that taxes are the price we pay for living in a civilized society, and in a moment when civilization is looking a little bit shaky,” he said.",

Among this year's recipients are Vest co-founder Axel Ericsson, Polkadot co-founder Robert Habermeier, MyCrypto CTO Daniel Ternyak and Mechanism Labs co-founder Aparna Krishnan, according to a press release.\nThey join the crypto community's most notable Thiel Fellow - ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who received the award in 2014. Each recipient will be given a $100,000 grant over the next two years to help them build their current and future projects.\nIn a newsletter, Allyson Dias, director of the Thiel Fellowship, said the purpose of the fellowship is to help young aspiring entrepreneurs to find innovative approaches to tackle real-world issues.\n\"Leaving behind the safety of the classroom and choosing to build a business instead isn't easy or glamorous. But our Fellows have found what we suspect to be true more broadly: young people learn best by doing things in the real world,\" she wrote.\nThiel himself is a noted bitcoin supporter. His Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, reportedly invested in $20 million' worth of bitcoin in January, as previously reported by CoinDesk.\nThe technology luminary was quoted last year saying he believes the critics of bitcoin are \"underestimating\" the cryptocurrency and calling bitcoin \"a reserve form of money.\"\nImage via Shutterstock.",

    "summary": "The outbreak has complicated tech upgrades, product development, logistics and business travel at crypto exchanges and other blockchain firms in China.",
    "content": "Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and other blockchain companies are coping with a new reality as the coronavirus outbreak continues to disrupt their daily operations.\nWhile crypto trading, customer service and marketing remain largely intact, the outbreak has taken its toll on technical upgrades, product development, logistics and business travel, according to a dozen executives in China interviewed by CoinDesk.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nFollowing the outbreak, the Chinese government extended its Lunar New Year vacation by one week to Feb.10. Weeks later, a few major Chinese cities remain locked down, and many companies have asked their employees to work from home – including blockchain businesses.\n“We encourage our employees to work remotely after the vacation as there are so many people from every part of China coming back to work,” said Aurora Wong, vice president at ZB Group. “The coronavirus is not a regional epidemic, it has been spread across the country and even to other countries.”\nThe outbreak “has caused psychological stress on people,” Wong said. “While many cities are not technically in lockdown, it is definitely not encouraged to come out for our own health and the whole society to get the epidemic under control.”\nFounded in China in 2013, Switzerland-based ZB Group claims its crypto exchange now serves over 10 million users, with $3 billion in average daily trading volume. It has operations across the world including China, Singapore, South Korea and the U.S.\nAccording to Wong, the outbreak is likely to slow the exchange’s technical upgrade to a new version. The upgrade could include front-end mobile apps for users as well as the back-end trading engine.\nBefore the outbreak, “we were very efficient and fast on upgrading our platform because people across different departments such as the engineering team, product development and marketing could meet and work together to carry out plans,” Wong said.\nHowever, the outbreak has had only a limited impact on daily operations of ZB’s trading platform since the firm keeps a schedule to rotate its staff to maintain the exchange, according to Wong.\nContingency planning\nEstonia-based Bibox crypto exchange, which also originated from China, said it has a contingency plan to tackle the operational challenges due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n“We might relocate our core engineering team to other Asian countries such as one of our Asian headquarters in Singapore or Vietnam where there are much fewer infected cases,” said Aries Wang, co-founder of Bibox.\nAccording to Wang, Bibox’s trading, marketing and customer service have not been affected much, but new product development and networking events with potential investors have been disrupted to a degree.\n“We originally planned a meeting for Chinese crypto funds and private equity firms in London to pave the way for our potential initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in March,” Wang said. “The meeting and IPO would probably be delayed to a later date.”\nFurther, when Bibox lists new tokens, the product development team needs to work very closely with the engineering team, creating custom services for clients and upgrading its own exchange platform. But this requires face-to-face meetings, which are for now rare.\nOKEx, one of the top three crypto exchanges by trading volume, said it’s staying vigilant now that it has resumed business after the vacation.\n“We suggested our employees stay where they already are, avoid crowds as much as possible and reduce business trips,” Jay Hao, the CEO of OKEx, said of its headquarters in Hong Kong.\n“Our offices have been completely disinfected, and we have also prepared protective equipment such as surgical masks, liquid soap and alcohol-based sanitizer for all of our employees,” Hao said.\nThe firm has upgraded its IT systems, such as phone and video conference software, to streamline the process of working from home and ensure normal operations throughout its global offices, according to Hao.\nWorking (and conferencing) remotely\nOutside of trading venues, other blockchain startups in the region say they’ve been significantly affected by the outbreak.\nB-Labs, a blockchain incubation center co-founded by Canaan Blockchain, OK Group and Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University, has decided to reduce rents for some of the startups that use the space and open a platform for them to apply for subsidies.\nConflux, a Beijing-based blockchain firm, is also coping with the outbreak’s ramifications.\n“Coronavirus has affected us in a way that we had to replan many offline events within the Asia Pacific region,” Christian Oertal, chief marketing officer at Conflux, said. “We had to pivot into organizing and participating in online events.”\n“As for office work, everyone at Conflux is working remotely from home. The health of everyone in the company should not be put into any risky situation in current times,” he added.\nAnother part of the blockchain industry which has been significantly affected by the outbreak is mining, the business of running expensive computers that race to solve math problems in order to record transactions and secure crypto networks.\nA spate of miner manufacturers, including Bitmian, MicroBT and Canaan, have expected some of their deliveries to be delayed due to slow logistics caused by the outbreak. Some of the mining farms are short of workers to maintain machines, while a few mining farms have been shut down by local governments as part of the measures to contain the epidemic.\nThe growth rate of mining difficulty, an indicator of the level of competition among bitcoin miners, has been slowing since the coronavirus outbreak, signaling that miners have paused upgrading to newer, more powerful machines.\nIn the most recent two-week cycle, from Feb. 11-25, this gauge declined for the first time since early December.",

    "summary": "For once, U.S. lawmakers had an informative conversation about blockchain technology without posturing.",
    "content": "For once, U.S. lawmakers had an informative conversation about blockchain technology without posturing.\nThe House Committee on Small Business hearing last week lasted only an hour, and only four members asked questions. But in some respects it was far more productive than an eight-hour hearing of the larger Financial Services Committee might have been.\nIt was a sharp contrast from past Capitol Hill proceedings, when lawmakers took their entire allotted time to compare Libra to terrorist attacks or ask pointed questions about how Silicon Valley is biased toward one partisan slant or another. Rather, the small-business hearing saw only detailed questions about the legal or practical implications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.\nThe specific question at hand was how small businesses might be able to use blockchain technology for data storage or fundraising. Ranking member Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) asked if blockchain has any areas which need to be worked out prior to mass adoption. Protocol Labs’ Marvin Ammori answered that user interfaces are probably the key holdup. Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) asked how blockchain can protect personal information and records. PopComm’s Dawn Dickson said an individual can more selectively grant access using blockchain.\nChairwoman Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) opened the hearing by saying that while cryptocurrencies are the obvious use case people associate with blockchain, it is not the only one.\n“Much of the power of the internet is concentrated in a few multi-billion dollar companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon,” she said. “Blockchain technology can help small businesses compete on a more level playing field.”\nThe witnesses likewise focused on practical applications.\n“Blockchain is not a silver bullet, but it can solve problems that small businesses face,” said Dickson, whose company provides software services to retailers.\nNext steps\nDickson told CoinDesk after the hearing she felt it was a positive experience, noting that she had been invited to testify as the operator of a small business.\nPerianne Boring, who leads the Chamber of Digital Commerce trade group, said the hearing was a step forward in relations between Congress and stakeholders in the private sector.\n“The next step is to create incentives for cooperation between companies that access and develop blockchain applications and government agencies focused on helping small businesses innovate and grow,” she said.\nJim Harper, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, described the hearing as another advance in Congress’s push to better understand cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n“Agencies and committees are thinking through the details,” he said.\nTaxation is probably the largest regulatory issue that needs to be tackled, however, Harper said. The Internal Revenue Service has not published much guidance around taxing crypto, particularly cryptocurrencies being used for spending.",

    "summary": "Most Davos experts appear to agree that blockchain technology is best for data collection rather than self-sovereign finance.",
    "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland — When the world’s leading bankers and policymakers gathered this week at the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, their interest in blockchain technology was resoundingly clear.\n“The number one use case of blockchain technology promoted by the government is data sharing,” Zhang Jiachen, CEO of the startup Guangzhishu Technology, said on the sidelines of the WEF. Jiachen said her firm works with several Chinese government agencies.\nRepresentatives from some nations are watching the People’s Bank of China's (PBoC) central bank digital currency (CBDC) experiment with eager anticipation. Neha Narula, director of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, described the dozens of central bank experiments with digital assets in 2020 as “inevitable.” Along those lines, the WEF published a Central Bank Digital Currency Policy-Maker Toolkit Wednesday to help those projects access global standards if they choose.\n“The Bank of Thailand has made good progress on a wholesale CBDC project, called Project Inthanon,” Veerathai Santiprabhob, governor of Bank of Thailand, said in a press statement. “From our experience, we need to identify tradeoffs between benefits from the use cases and their associated risks across different dimensions.”\nIn turn, Jiachen said Chinese technologists are drawing inspiration from the Facebook-initiated Libra project and ethereum, although she declined to say what types of initiatives are inspired by the latter.\n“Can we join a consortium of countries who would like to use a regional digital currency where the PBoC is part of it?” she said in an interview. “There’s a lot of strategic thinking around whether that’s a real option.”\nMultiple efforts\nMost experts at Davos appear to agree blockchain technology should be used for more data collection, not self-sovereign finance.\nFor example, Ibrahima Guimba-Saidou, technology advisor to the president of Niger, said it will be crucial for emerging economies to use digital reporting systems to avoid embezzlement and other financial crimes.\n“My goal is to have a paperless government by 2028,” he said on the sidelines of the WEF. “How could any leader or government official take that money without being noticed? Cryptocurrency brings that; through the blockchain you know where things are.”\nAs with China, Guimba-Saidou said his country is curious about the idea of a regional token.\nIt may be too soon to say whether bitcoin will be used by African nations, he added, but 15 nations in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are in talks about launching a pan-African currency comparable to the euro.\nMatthew Blake, the WEF’s monetary systems lead, said a digital, regional currency in Africa makes a lot of sense, although the euro has proved that cooperative currency governance is tricky at best.\nWhile he expressed interest in watching how bitcoin evolves, Blake was skeptical, at best, of nation-states using bitcoin or allowing enterprises to use bitcoin on a significant scale. Mikail Jabbarov, economic minister of the Azerbaijan Republic, likewise told CoinDesk he struggled to imagine nation-states condoning the use of a decentralized currency.\nWhile he didn’t suggest it should be banned outright, Jabbarov’s primary concern was collecting know-your-customer (KYC) information associated with bitcoin ownership. He was otherwise dismissive of the cryptocurrency’s potential for use cases beyond speculation and illicit activities.\nAt least, in Guimba-Saidou’s case, the focus is on monitoring public servants’ monetary transactions rather than all civilians. Along those lines, to safeguard who can access civilian monetary records and even passive surveillance of broader patterns, the PBoC recently filed a patent for a blockchain-based system for authorizing access to data.\n“We’re going to have a public key infrastructure,” Niger’s Guimba-Saidou said. “That’s how I think we can have the transparency and traceability in place and the accountability that comes from it. All those things have to be done with independent organizations because otherwise one organization could try to grab the information or alter it.”\nReal names\nThere’s widespread concern about bitcoin wallets that essentially allow “secret bank accounts,” according to Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center.\nIn an interview, she said Russia isn’t the only nation with a state-owned nuclear power plant that is also supporting bitcoin mining operations. This trend is also spreading to Ukraine and Moldova, she said, with Ukrainian oligarchs taking dominant roles in the local bitcoin market.\n“When we see a politician declaring bitcoin, we consider him ‘high risk,’” Kaleniuk said. “This money can buy propaganda campaigns. … There needs to be unique identities of natural persons in this data.”\nSome of these central bank projects go beyond mere identity checks. In China, there are already efforts to use government data, everything from healthcare data to telecommunications records, to shape financial services offered by the private sector.\n“The government owns a lot of data,” Jiachen said. “They want to enable the private sector to be able to use them but they don’t want to hand over the data ownership. So we help the government in supporting their data-sharing initiatives.”\nMost raw data isn’t recorded on the blockchain, she said. Instead, blockchain technology is used to prove the records were verified or calculated at the source, without sharing the original source. Jiachen said she hopes there will be strict policies that regulate who can request and access such data. MIT’s Nerula mirrored this concern.\n“I hope privacy is a central concern and that it’s implemented with the Application Program Interface [API] in mind,” Nerula said.\nBigger government\nEven private investors from a variety of countries, who asked not to be named, were curious about central bank experiments but wary of self-custodied assets.\nThose who are optimistic about digital assets in Davos see them as a way to improve governance rather than reduce reliance on it.\n“It’s easier to track the whole monetary flows and then you can make better monetary policies,” Jiachen said. “Now with a blockchain-based system, you will have a better feedback loop.”\nShe said many blockchain efforts, beyond the PBoC currency yet also adjacent to it, are targeting cross-border trade.\nMeanwhile, economist and ethereum community guru Glen Weyl is busy taking meetings with politicians from emerging economies. He said he’s not a fan of China’s Communist approach but he hopes China’s collective and civic mentality can be leveraged to help pioneer value systems beyond traditional assets.\n“Eventually we need to have less money and have forms of value that are more socially contextualized, like weighted edges on a graph that represent favors owed,” Weyl said in an interview. “China has social credit, so in some ways they are much more attuned to the social aspect\" of money.\nIn order to avoid dystopian consequences, Weyl is working with organizations like the World Bank to develop the Data Freedom Act, which asserts data collectors have a “fiduciary responsibility and democratic responsibility” to both protect it and not flagrantly use data without consent. The document is based on providing a framework for “collective bargaining,” Weyl said, to give civilians more power to challenge problematic situations than they would have as individuals.\nSpeaking more broadly about CBDC experiments, WEF executive committee member Blake said the organization wants to \"lean in\" and \"be active\" there.",

    "content": "Bitcoin wallet and blockchain explorer provider Blockchain just launched its first exchange platform.\nBlockchain’s head of retail products, TD Ameritrade alum Nicole Sherrod, told CoinDesk the custodial exchange, called The PIT, can connect to non-custodial Blockchain wallets for nearly instant transfers. Registration opens today, with the ability to trade up to 26 assets rolling out over the next two weeks.\nSherrod said that with nearly 40 million wallets already created – and an exchange matching-engine set up in London’s Equinix LD4 data center – PIT could be posed to attract more liquidity than competitors.\n“That’s what market makers are looking for,” Sherrod said. “They want to co-locate [data center servers] with you, they want to directly connect to your matching engine. It’s the way it’s done on Wall Street.”\nIndeed, Tom Haller, previously the chief software architect for trading systems at the New York Stock Exchange, contributed to the development of PIT’s matching engine.\nSherrod added the exchange will measure speed in “microseconds,” like traditional asset exchanges. However, an anonymous industry expert was skeptical about whether that theoretical speed with remain constant under real pressures. The source said many infrastructure dependencies are “almost impossible to model out,” so the system will only prove itself when tested by “real-world trading volumes.”\nEither way, Blockchain is prioritizing diverse token offerings over margin trading options and the bitcoin software update SegWit, both of which are also on the road map.\n“Beyond the 26 [assets] we already know what our phase two asset listings are going to be, as well as phase three,” Sherrod said, declining to name any assets beyond what the wallet already supports.\nIt remains to be seen how PIT will compete with mainstream exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which also offer a plethora of crypto assets. Coinbase was also a wallet provider and brokerage, before it became Silicon Valley’s iconic unicorn exchange.\n“We’re looking to compete on the overall client experience,” Sherrod said, adding that a new customer support team has become the second-largest division of the company as part of a broader shift to exchange services.\nMainstream exchanges are generally slow to respond to retail users when market activity spikes, so Sherrod argued that beyond speed this is another area where PIT could rival incumbents.\nOnly time will tell if the new revenue flows Blockchain users generate through transaction fees will justify this expansion into the heavily saturated exchange space, with fierce competition for market makers and heavily regulatory costs.\nBlockchain is applying for new licenses in various jurisdictions, Sherrod said, but failed to specify which ones. In the meantime, the exchange won’t operate in any jurisdiction that requires a license, a spokesperson added.\nBlockchain CEO Peter Smith image via CoinDesk archives",

    "summary": "Salesforce announces its first blockchain partners including Arizona State University. The product will add blockchain to its popular CRM products.",
    "content": "Salesforce, the leading provider of cloud solutions for business management, revealed its own blockchain solution today built on the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. Executives made the announcement at the company's tech conference, TrailheaDX.\nThe product, named Salesforce Blockchain, is \"a low-code blockchain platform that extends the power of CRM (client relations management).\" The company says that the solution helps users build and maintain blockchain networks, apps and smart contracts, allowing them to \"create and share blockchain objects in the same process as any CRM data object — with clicks, not code,\" according to Salesforce's press release.\nLow-code is a framework that allows for drag-and-drop programming for complex apps and is gaining popularity in enterprise businesses.\nThe solution also helps integrate blockchain data into sales forecasts and predictions, integrate other existing blockchains with Salesforce, and \"add third parties to their blockchain with a few clicks,\" the company said.\nSalesforce also named the three first clients that are testing the product right now. One of them is the research data company IQVIA, which is exploring the tech to track and validate medical drug labels. Another one, ratings agency S&P Global, is looking into how the solution can speed up the review and approval of new business bank accounts.\nChris Heusler, global chief commercial officer at S&P Global Ratings, said in a statement:\nThe third partner, Arizona State University, is testing tracking academic records on the blockchain.\n\"This network has the potential to be a game changer for integrated, seamless learning — increasing transparency of student achievements and ultimately making the exchange process of academic records easier for both learners and institutions,\" Kent Hopkins, vice president of enrollment at Arizona State University, said in a release.\nWhile currently only selected clients are able to try out Salesforce's blockchain solution, it should be generally available in 2020, the company said.\nA year of exploration\nSalesforce first announced its blockchain plans at TrailheaDX a year ago when the company's CEO Marc Benioff told Business Insider he had been thinking about the idea since the World Economic Forum in Davos that January. At the forum, an attendee approached Benioff and suggested Salesforce should apply the technology in its offerings. Benioff said he was intrigued by the idea.\n“And it’s like you know if you did this, this and this you could add blockchain and cryptocurrencies into Salesforce... And I’m like ‘wow’ and that’s kind of how it works,” Belioff said, according to Ledger Insights.\nEarlier, Salesforce partnered with the blockchain startup Dapps Inc., which in May 2017 announced the release of a product allowing users to integrate the Salesforce system with the Hyperledger, ethereum and bitcoin blockchains, Ledger Insights reported.\nThis April, Salesforce announced that it had joined the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI), the global blockchain think tank with participants like Microsoft, IBM, the Bank of Canada, PepsiCo, Raiffeisen Bank, Polymath and others.\nIn November, Salesforce secured a patent for a blockchain system designed to filter spam and check if emails are changed or otherwise tampered with after being sent. \"Used properly, the immutability and distributed nature of the blockchain can make it impossible to modify information once it has been committed to the blockchain,” the patent said.\nOn May 23, the company published a blockchain primer for the readers of its corporate blog, describing the basic principles of the technology and use cases like money transfers, medical record storage, and supply chain management. It also explained what benefits the blockchain tech can bring to the fields Salesforce is focused on, like customer relationship management.\n\"Blockchain is a technology that promises to fundamentally change how we share information, buy and sell things, and verify the authenticity of information we rely on every single day — from what we eat to who we say we are. And because it can facilitate all of this in secure, efficient, and transparent ways across many different domains, the effects can be transformative — every business, government, and individual can benefit,\" the blog post said.\nSalesforce image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Longenesis Brings South Korean Medical Records to the Blockchain",
    "summary": "A new partnership lets patients and doctors store medical records privately on the blockchain using Bitfury's Exonum platform.",
    "content": "Longenesis, a Riga, Latvia-based but Hong Kong-incorporated company, is bringing medical records to the blockchain in South Korea using Bitfury's Exonum platform.\nLongenesis\n, which was formed in late 2017, provides a suite of modular blockchain solutions for medical providers, supplying everything from user interfaces for patient interaction to medical recordkeeping. But its main focus has become medical-consent technologies.\nWith its platform, every step of the process is linked, verifiable and auditable. The patient agrees to specified care or participation in a study or a trial. They can withdraw that agreement, while the medical provider can offer to extend, modify or amend the agreement.\nAccording to the company, it will be providing its medical-consent platform-as-a-service to Hanshin Medipia Medical Center and Infinity Care. That brings to four the number of business relationships it has in South Korea, currently the company’s primary market of focus.t\nThe key, said Denis Bazinov, Longenesis project manager, is the way in which the system works with pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. They can peruse the anonymous metadata to see what information might be available. They can then offer to the owner of the data—the patient—the opportunity to participate trials or studies or release their existing information to be used in the evaluation of a medicine or procedure.\nBazinov said this is very different from current normal operating procedures. In most cases, consent is handled by using paper forms, and the system for renewing, updating and altering consent is haphazard and inconsistent. Once the data is collected, it is traded in an OTC-like manner, with researchers paying for bulk deliveries of information that may not be reliable or properly collected.\n“What our platform offers is a transparent chain from the patient through to the hospital,” Bazinov said. “Our desire is to make more information available to the researchers, who now face problems of quantity and quality.”\nHanshin Medipia, located in Seocho, Seoul, specializes in testing and health checkups. Infinity Care is the developer of a healthcare algorithm.\nLongenesis is already active in South Korea and has two previous transactions in the market. In April, it signed an agreement with Incheon-based Gil Medical Center to develop a blockchain solution for medical-data management. The other relationship is with Korea’s Terragene.\nThe solution being provided by Longenesis utilizes Bitfury's Exonum, a framework for decentralized blockchain applications. According to Bitfury, the platform is highly secure, transparent and auditable, written using the Rust programing language.\nLongenesis has the exclusive license for the use of Exonum in the medical field.\nThe company notes that the product is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant, so it meets both US and EU standards.\nInsilico\nwas founded in 2014 and has raised a total of $14.3 million, according to Crunchbase. Bitfury, a blockchain company, has raised a total of $170 million over a number of funding rounds. Investors include Macquarie Capital. At the end of 2018, valuation was estimated at more than $1 billion.\nBitfury, which is considering an initial public offering this year, already has significant relationships with South Korean partners. Earlier this year, it established Bitcoin mining operations in Paraguay with Commons Foundation, a Seoul-based group. Korelya Capital, which is based in Paris and connected with South Korea's Naver, was an investor in an $80 million Bitfury funding round late last year.\nImage via Shutterstock.",

    "summary": "Crypto may be seeing an influx of mystics, but that might not be a sign the industry is on the right course, CoinDesk editor Bailey Reutzel writes.",
    "content": "There's a man and a woman dancing beneath a lush wreath held up by four wands, crystals protruding from their tops.\n\"It's a good card to pull.\"\nThe Four of Wands.\nIn front of me – my life – there's good times, happiness, good fortune.\nReading from an online tarot card symbology site, my friend and tonight my forecaster says, \"If you have been working on a project, this card indicates you will reach an important milestone and will have cause to celebrate. You have completed a significant phase of the project and can feel very proud of what you have accomplished so far.\"\nShe continues:\nWho knew my time living around a bunch of \"witches\" in Colorado would parlay so well into my time in cryptocurrency today?\nWhen asked about the hand:shake pre-ICO launch party – where delights included face painting, a palm reader and some mysterious \"restoration\" practice called Jaguar Awakening – someone at the event said, \"It was offensively lavish and not very smart.\"\nHarsh. Not unbelievable.\nThere were nerds and anarchists and conspiracy theorists in cryptocurrency not but a year ago. They're still here, of course. But they've been drowned out recently by the hippies and spirituals and soothsayers.\nAnd they're quite like the psychics I saw in Colorado, living in small cluttered apartments with hundreds of little vials of oils – pine needles and rose buds and seeds soaking in the mixture – filling the cabinets, whose doors are kept open.\nEverything is for sale, but not because they want to sell it, but because if you're suffering from anxiety, depression, a broken heart even, the oils can soothe whatever ails you.\nThere's no harm in a $40 bottle of olive oil mixed with cinnamon and eucalyptus, just like there's no harm in the 10 cent private key these new age prophets are slinging.\nSlinging by the millions.\nSo what? What a deal. The industry says they'll be worth more than that bottle of oil at some point, and not only worth more by price but have a utility you'll want in your future digital life.\nMaybe I will. Maybe you will. Maybe A16z will.\nThere is a problem, though.\nAnother friend of mine, a tarot reader told her she would get married by 23. Six months before that birthday, she had no boyfriend, no prospects even and was freaking out. Those words ate at her.\n\"What if I missed it?\"\nShe had to see another reader.\nDrunkenly the next night, we stumbled into a basement shop, a small neon light in the window, blinking the words.\nIt wasn't tarot, but palmistry.\nBut her palms, they had no such ideas of marriage at such a ripe young age. Instead, they spelled out adventure and travel and big changes.\nAll was well.\nShe didn't miss it. It was never there.\nIt's not hard to get wrapped up in the cards, or the lines, or the aura. It's actually surprisingly easy. Because we're all looking for answers to questions we cannot answer when we want the answers.\nYou can be OK with not knowing. That's the only way I've found even a tiny bit of solace in my life.\nBut it's a struggle.\nIt's the same struggle the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry deals with every day.\n\"What is this all for?\"\nAnd without the answers laid neatly before them in the real world, they've turned to all varieties of pseudoscience and a whole assortment of charlatans.\nFor god's sake, Deepak Chopra, the popular Jesus figure of the New Age and alternative medicine movements, whose ideas have negatively affected people's understanding of science, is leading a meditation at ConsenSys' Ethereal Summit this year.\nAnd it's not offensive to me that some human would lead meditation, it's offensive that some company would pay this human (who has turned a fun, soothing activity into a fear-based cash cow) tens of thousands of dollars that they've made because people believe in the company's idea to lead a meditation at a conference that's theoretically supposed to be about understanding what the fuck all this crypto shit is for.\nBut we've said it for some time now, \"Blockchain is a product looking for a solution.\"\nIt's looking for an answer.\nThe industry is looking for an answer … to why people have quit their kush jobs in banking to join the ranks of startups, to why people have invested billions of dollars – even dollars they can't actually afford to lose – in projects that are only an idea in some nerdy millennial's mind, to why people like me seem to care so much about seeing the technology prosper … and today, they'll use any mechanism, no matter how fraudulent, to prove it.\n\"Oh shit.\"\nMy friend, all the sudden realizes (we've had a few glasses of wine), facing towards me The Four of Wands is in reverse – upside down.\n\"This changes things.\"\nSee in tarot, a card in reverse speaks a different truth, the opposite truth.\n\"The Four of Wands reversed suggests uncertainty about what you can and cannot depend on. You may be placed in a situation which appeases your immediate concerns but does not solve the longer-term issues.\"\nMillions made. But scaling. Governance. Generally cryptocurrency and blockchain's existential crisis.\n\"Is there a situation, a relationship even, that you feel insecure about,\" my friend asks rhetorically.\nShe knows what's going on – (at the time) I'm about to move to New York for a job I know will be a slog, especially given my current life spending my mornings hiking around Pike's Peak and my evenings, drinking wine and waxing philosophical with good friends and a boyfriend.\nI give her a knowing look.\nThe same look I give now to the token issuers who tell me how great it's going to be to put diamonds or marriage licenses or music on \"the blockchain.\"\nBut they don't seem to acknowledge it. Not like she does.\nShe knows she can speak to my very essence.\nThey are still trying to speak to my fingers moving across a keyboard because they want those fingers to speak to someone's wallet, because they just want a little more time to figure out why they've come to put all their effort into something so ephemeral.\nYou can poke fun at it. It's easy enough to.\nBut if you roll your eyes too hard, you might miss the point.\nOr you might also save yourself a lot of stress, heartache and turmoil.\nWho knows?\nFor now crypto community, \"The cards are in your favor.\"\nTarot cards image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "A key metric is hovering at record highs, suggesting investors are likely holding bitcoins even when deep in the red.",
    "content": "A key metric is hovering at record highs, suggesting investors are likely holding bitcoins even when deep in the red.\nThe number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in loss rose to all-time highs above $45 million on Dec. 17, representing a 578 percent rise from the July 1 figure of $6.69 million, according to on-chain market intelligence firm Glassnode.\nA UTXO is basically leftover bitcoins after a transaction. It’s a little bit like getting back change when paying for something in cash using large bills.\nFor example, Alice has 10 bitcoins and needs to pay three BTC to Bob, a merchant. Alice can’t just send out three BTC and hold the rest. Instead, she will have to spend 10 BTC, of which three BTC will be sent to Bob and the remaining seven BTC will be sent back to the address she controls. These seven bitcoins are UTXOs and can be used as inputs in another transaction.\nA loss-making UTXO is the one whose price at the time it was created was higher than the current price.\nThe fact that the UTXO-loss metric is hovering at record highs following a 50 percent price slide from June highs above $13,800 to recent lows near $6,500 indicates investors are likely holding on to their loss-making outputs, according to Alex Benfield, a crypto asset analyst at Digital Assets Data.\n\"There have been 438 days where someone could have bought bitcoin and would currently be at a loss at the time of writing,\" Benfield told CoinDesk in an email. \"About half of these days took place in 2019 (dating back to May 12) and would represent short-term holders of less than one year. The other half dates back to as early as Nov. 3 of 2017 and are over two years old, representing long term-holders. Any bitcoin purchased during one of the days where the price was higher than it is today contributes to the UTXO-loss metric, which will continue to reach new all-time highs if the price continues to drop while buyers hold on to their bitcoin.\"\nMeanwhile, Yan Liberman, co-founder of research boutique Delphi Digital, said UTXO’s in loss can represent long-term holders and cited bitcoin’s market value to realize value (MVRV) ratio as a quicker way to gauge the amount of UTXOs in loss.\nThe MVRV ratio is calculated by dividing market value by realized value. While the market value is found by counting all mined coins equally at current market price, the realized value represents the sum of all coin values based on the last time they moved (sum of all UTXOs).\nThus, a falling ratio implies there are large amounts of UTXOs in loss, Liberman told CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio currently stands at 1.23, having peaked at 2.38 in June, according to data source woobull.com.\nAlso, there is evidence that long-term holders haven’t been selling. The portion of supply held for at least 12 months started the year at 55.6 percent, peaked at the end of April at 60.8 percent, and sat at almost 59 percent at the end of November, according to Delphi Digital.\nFurther, the portion of supply held for more than two years stood at an all-time high of 40 percent at the end of November, having started the year at 34.6 percent.\nAll in all, there is strong reason to believe that “HOLDing” has driven the UTXO-loss metric to record highs.\nThe drop in the number of transactions seems to have played a role as well, according to Glassnode.\nAs shown in the chart above, the seven-day moving average of the on-chain transactions has declined from the high of 378,808 seen at the end of June to lows near 304,000. Fewer transactions mean fewer UTXOs have been created during the price slide.",

    "content": "UPDATE (Dec. 18, 18:50 UTC): An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Waves Enterprise had been chosen as the contractor for the project. It was one of five companies that tested blockchain systems with Rosseti, which has yet to name a contractor to build one, according to an executive whose quotes have been added to the article.\nRussia’s national power grid company Rosseti has tested five systems for electricity bill payments based on distributed ledgers, including ones by software giant SAP and blockchain startup Waves.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nWaves Enterprise, the enterprise blockchain arm of Russia-based Waves, said in a blog post that its pilot involved 400 households in two Russian administrative regions.\nIn the next phase, which is expected to start in early 2020, the entire regions of Kaliningrad oblast and Yekaterinburg will use the system. The next step will be expanding it to all of Russia, according to Waves Enterprise.\nThe system Waves Enterprise developed will access data from the power meters in houses and apartments, store it and distribute consumers’ payments between the company generating the electricity and the power grid operator, according to the announcement. This is intended to make the calculation of the payments more transparent and reduce what households owe for electricity, a debt that has reached over $12.5 billion in Russia in 2019.\nHouseholds will be able to see how much power they are using via an app and choose a more suitable tariff such as opting for one that provides a cheaper price during the night hours, according to the announcement.\nAlong with SAP and Waves, three companies piloted their solutions for Rosseti, said Alexander Sadov, head of the project management at Rosseti Ural, the subsidiary that is supervising the project. They are Digital Horizon, Digital Energy Laboratory and B41.\nThe winner, however, is still to be chosen in a public call for bids scheduled for Q1 2020, and the winner in the bid will be able to build a distributed ledger-based solution for electricity consumption records, with the plan to launch into production in the mid-2021, Sadov said.\n“We see now that the technology is working. With it, we can check that the electricity consumption data is consistent,” Sadov said.\nAccording to him, using a distributed ledger can help prevent the manipulation of data, which can happen when the intermediaries that accumulate the data from consumers pass it to the generating companies for billing.\n“We believe the system should be developed on a private blockchain and on a platform developed in our country, meeting our demands for data protection and cryptography,” the chairman of Rosseti, Sergei Semerikov, said in the press release. Also participating in the pilot was Russia’s largest privately owned bank, Alfa Bank.\nRosseti previously announced another local blockchain pilot in collaboration with Gazprombank, Russia’s oil and gas giant’s subsidiary, and the venture fund Digital Horizon.",

Ultimately, the group managed to conduct over 300 transactions in 19 countries across eight timezones.\nThe app's self-sovereign design is aimed to allow firms' customers to build and maintain their own identities, as well as enable them to approve or reject access requests from banks. When customers updated their data in the test, this was automatically updated for any banks with access permission.\nR3 said in the statement:\nAccording to R3, this can lead to improved efficiency and lower costs at financial institutions by \"eliminating the need for each institution to individually attest and update KYC records.\" The model could also help avoid data privacy and security problems, since only parties with the need to see the data will have access to it, and only those with permission from the customer.\n\"Not only does this project demonstrate how blockchain can allow institutions to retain control of and manage their own identity,\" said David Rutter, CEO of R3, \"but it also validates the design choices we made in our approach to privacy on Corda.\"\nAlso involved in the trial were ABN AMRO, Societe Generale, China Merchants Bank, ING, Raiffeisen and many more.

    "content": "IBM is launching a new app that uses blockchain to allow consumers interested in sustainability to trace the coffee they buy along the supply chain.\nIBM said its new \"Thank My Farmer\" app will allow consumers to track their morning joe from the store where they buy it back to the farm where it was grown. Built in collaboration with traceability platform Farm Connect, which also uses IBM's blockchain, the app is expected to launch sometime this year. It was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\nThe app has the support of 10 leading organizations in the coffee industry, including Beyers Koffie and the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC), the largest association of its kind in that country.\nThe app helps consumers interested in supporting sustainable coffee businesses to make informed choices. In particular, it can be used to promote ethical and environmentally friendly coffee suppliers.\n\"The aim is humanizing each coffee drinker's relationship with their daily cup,\" said David Behrends, Farmer Connect founder and president. \"Consumers now can play an active role in sustainability governance by supporting coffee farmers in developing nations. Through the blockchain and this consumer app, we're creating a virtuous cycle.\"\nCoffee has a long and complicated supply chain. Once grown it has to be shipped, roasted and packaged before finally ending up on retailers' shelves. With so many participants, supply information can become fragmented, making it extremely difficult for consumers to discover where their coffee originated from with any great accuracy.\nThank My Farmer isn't the first initiative using blockchain to make the coffee supply chain transparent. The Ethiopian government last year said it was exploring how to use blockchain to track its coffee exports together with IOHK. Starbucks said last May that it would begin using Microsoft's Azure blockchain providing consumers with a \"complete view\" of its supply chain.\nThank My Farmer uses IBM's blockchain to standardize the information and make it accessible in one place. Consumers scan QR codes on the side of the coffee jar to look at the origins of their purchase and can choose to make additional payments to the farmers who grew the beans.\n\"This project is another example of how blockchain technology can enable a channel for real change,\" said Raj Rao, IBM Food Trust general manager. \"Blockchain is more than aspirational business tech, it is used today to transform how people can build trust in the goods they consume. For business, it can drive greater transparency and efficiency.\"\nInitially available for selected brands in North America and Europe, IBM plans to expand to other coffee producers as well as offer new initiatives, such as support pages for consumers to donate to the local communities where their coffee is grown.",

    "content": "General Motors (GM) may be eyeing a blockchain platform to manage data from future fleets of automated cars.\nA patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office details a process by which self-driving cars would be able to store all their data on a distributed ledger. The document, produced by GM Global Technology Operations LLC, further notes that any data stored could be easily shared among the blockchain's users.\nAs one notable use case for the blockchain-based data, the firm suggested a role in navigation, explaining:\nSharing data between different independent platforms is also proposed in the filing. A blockchain exchange for municipalities, local authorities and public facilities such as airports could, it says, determine the \"validity of permits and licenses to operate as hacks, taxis, or other for-hire services.\" Further, if a vehicle is ticketed, that information could be shared with a blockchain run by the relevant authority.\nTying payments into the system would allow cars to maintain balances to cover charges related to tolls, parking and other fee based services, the filing adds.\nGM has spent considerable time and effort on such autonomous vehicles, announcing in March that it would begin production of their autonomous vehicles next year. The automaker has also already begun efforts to explore blockchain technology. It joined other automotive companies like BMW to form the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) as an effort to push innovation in the blockchain-auto space.\nGM building image via Linda Parton/Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Crypto startup Orbs has been working with the Trump administration to explore blockchain solutions related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.",
    "content": "The Trump administration has tapped Israeli crypto startup Orbs to develop blockchain solutions for the region’s longstanding political conflicts.\nThe disclosure comes this week from a summit convened by the White House in Bahrain to discuss the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The New York Times reported Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said investments in the Palestinian territory would be like a “hot I.P.O.” The White House is aiming to put $50 billion behind it's so-called \"Peace to Prosperity\" plan.\nOrbs cofounder Netta Korin told CoinDesk in an email that her team has been “working with the U.S. Administration and the State Department … on several projects that are currently in stealth mode.”\nKorin, who is also co-founder of the nonprofit Hexa Foundation focused on social-impact blockchain projects, added:\nKorin says the approach is emblematic of “a paradigm shift” in dealing with economic aid to the Palestinian people. “Where the default used to be donations, the future will now be based on investments,” she told CoinDesk. “The solutions that are being sought after will be innovative and game-changing.”\nStepping back, Korin was one of the few Israelis to join White House advisor Jared Kushner at the Bahrain summit. American economist Kevin Hassett even floated the idea of using blockchain technology to resolve land title disputes in the Palestinian territories, which perhaps overlook the fact such conflicts generally involve the Israeli military.\nPreviously, an anonymous source with knowledge of Israeli–Palestinian diplomatic relations told CoinDesk that blockchain solutions for tracking capital flows in the Palestinian territories have been discussed over the past year.\nIn particular, the source said, a meeting last October with U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker and several representatives from the Bank of Israel and the Israeli Finance Ministry explored such blockchain solutions. There were no Palestinians present at the meeting, the anonymous source said, although the Palestinian Monetary Authority is also reportedly exploring blockchain solutions.\nMeanwhile, personal ties between the Israeli crypto industry and government bodies continue to deepen. Korin was previously an advisor to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, General Yoav Mordechai. Plus, Korin’s husband is Nadav Shemesh, a former aide to the Israeli Ministry of Finance Moshe Kahlon. This is hardly unique in Israel. For example, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s niece and nephew, Guy and Galia Ben-Artzi, are co-founders of the blockchain startup Bancor.\nDanny Brown Wolf, head of partnerships at Orbs and former advisor with Israel's United Nations delegation, told CoinDesk that although \"no one thinks technology can solve the conflict\" blockchain solutions could help distribute humanitarian aid to Palestinians and \"support economic development.\"\nOn the surface, it appears not much has changed since the meetings last fall, as the Palestinian Authority boycotted this week’s Bahrain summit. Although Korin declined to name any specific Palestinian partners or project plans, she said her team is working with Palestinians “on both the design of these projects and the implementation on the ground.”\nPalestinian tech-industry leaders did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment. We will update the article if we hear back.\nIn conclusion, Korin added:\nDonald Trump image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "The US Department of the Treasury has just published five tips for building blockchain projects.\nAccording to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service website, the list is based on the lessons staff learned while working on a proof of concept blockchain system for tracking physical assets, such as computers or cars, which began last autumn.\nAfter months of tinkering with distributed ledgers, the first and most important insight offered is for people to ask themselves: Is blockchain technology a good fit for this concept?\nThese are some of the questions the Treasury recommends using to determine if blockchain technology is central to the project:\nIf the answer to several of those questions is yes, the next step could be interviewing a variety of different stakeholders to understand their pain points, the Treasury states. It also recommends seeking out diverse teams and documenting the entire process, to help spot weaknesses and opportunities.\nThe website warns, though:\nThe advice concludes by advising that entrepreneurs carve out time for explaining the basics of blockchain technology to everyone from investors to lawyers. Again, this is because diverse perspectives can help teams get beyond the hype surrounding blockchain experiments.\n“There is no way to sugar coat it – agency governance processes can be time-consuming,” according to the website. “Building enough time into your project plan to present and explain blockchain technology in clear, easy-to-understand terms will help you plan for, and move through the process swiftly.”\nDepartment of the Treasury image via Shutterstock",

It's already pursing similar government contracts around the world, including an oil-tracking platform for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n“The adoption of new digital technology into Canadian industry will help ensure our firms strengthen their competitive advantage,” said Hans Parmar, a media relations manager for ISED.\nTariff concerns\nCanada’s steel industry is a major international exporter, especially to the U.S. But that heavy reliance was rocked by President Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs and the ensuing market uncertainty. Last year, exports were down 22 percent.\nMandic said the tariffs provide a context for Canada’s search for a blockchain-based steel supply chain solution. Asserting Trump’s decision was motivated, in part, by fears of tariff dodgers who route their exports through untaxed markets, Mandic said blockchain’s immutability can verify claims of product origin.\n“What the blockchain provides is the ability to have a specific set of records in specific points of time,” he said. “You cannot go back in time and change the path.”\nISED’s Parmar refuted the idea that the project was launched in response to the Section 232 steel tariffs. But in a statement to CoinDesk he also explained the platform could have blockchain-specific benefits.\n“The technology solution may facilitate trade and domestic policy adjustments, including aligning country of origin marking regimes, certification and labelling if implemented,” he said.",

The filing was published last Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), having been submitted in December 2016.\nCME cites airline frequent flyer programs as one example of where this system would be needed. If an airline chooses to store its frequent flyer customer data on a public blockchain, it would need to have a process in place to change the rules governing the blockchain in case the airline changes the rules or another aspect of the frequent flyer program itself.\nThe application notes that while public blockchains are important for cryptocurrencies, their difficult-to-change nature makes them less than ideal for some private and commercial uses.\nThe application explains:\nThe filing represents the latest blockchain-related intellectual property bid for the derivatives giant.

However, it's a notable indication of interest, as big bank blockchain work has generally been confined to private or permissioned ledgers (though that may be changing).\nThat said, the filing offers ample praise for public blockchains, in which any individuals running the software may successfully approve transactions.\n\"One advantage of block chain [sic] based ledgers is the public nature of the block chain architecture that allows anyone in the public to review the content of the ledger and verify ownership,\" the application states.\nGoing further, such a ledger would allow anyone to verify that a transaction occurred, while using a decentralized platform increases redundancy, thereby “[minimizing] risk of falsification of ledgers.”\nElsewhere, the patent also comments on the slower speed of such a system, suggesting TD Bank may be becoming more accustomed to the attributes of blockchain systems that have been treated by other institutions as drawbacks.\nTD Bank image via Alan Stoddard / Shutterstock",

The overreach of many centralized institutions as it relates to personal data, in particular, has made headlines recently, perhaps the most notable being third-party application's collection of Facebook users’ private information.\nSpeaking on a panel to the Facebook scandal, Christiana Cacciapuoti, vice president of partnerships and platform operations at Mad Hive said:\nJeremy Balkin, head of U.S. innovation at HSBC Bank, echoed that, saying, blockchain adoption, in general, is being sped up by a lack of faith in existing systems.\nUnlike Cacciapuoti who spoke to today's social media platforms, Balkin pointed to financial systems as an example, where people - in particular, millennials - are looking to the nascent technology as a way to protect their privacy and security.\nBut it's not just individuals that are hoping the technology provides a better security architecture for their digital lives, but also large corporates.\nGil Beyda, managing director at Comcast Ventures, said the telecommunications giant is looking into using distributed ledger technology for increased security, not only in preventing networks from being compromised but also in compartmentalizing the potential damage if a system is compromised.\nSecurity holes\nThat said, many of the panelists were cautious about how far blockchain really goes to secure systems - at least at present.\nFor instance, McAfee chief consumer security evangelist Gary Davis warned that blockchain technology has a major flaw: though blockchain itself may be a secure technology, it is surrounded by security holes.\n“It rides on the internet, so by definition you’re putting a technology on something that is proven to be very vulnerable, very prone to attack,\" he said.\nHe pointed to the recent MyEtherWallet hack, whereby attackers were able to drain $150,000 worth of users' ether through a vulnerability in the domain name servers the wallet was using.\nOn top of that, while many see the immutability of blockchains as an advantage, Comcast Venture's Beyda said that feature could become a major issue for people who store their identity or financial information on a platform.\n“[Right now] it’s inconvenient if our identity is stolen, if our credit card is stolen, but we have mechanisms to recover that,\" he said. \"If you have a public-private key pair, and you lose that, it’s gone … if you have a private key, you have access to all of the resources.”\nAs such, he continued, “The first level of attack is not trying to crack the public-private keys, but to steal the private keys.”\nStill, Beyda remained hopeful, saying the industry must be patient as the technologists \"catch up\" with business needs.\nHe concluded:\nDavid Bailey, Gary Davis and Gil Beyda image via Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk",

This, the bank says, helps reduce friction in international payments and ultimately leads to faster processing times.\nThe system is also a way of reducing the risk of money laundering, which is why over 80 Japanese banks have expressed an interest in joining IIN, Sanai said.\nJapan has been under pressure to up its anti-money laundering game since the Financial Action Task Force found \"numerous and serious deficiencies\" in 2014.\nIIN's ability to reduce delays in the payments process would allow the member banks to quickly collaborate with law enforcement in suspected cases of money laundering, an official at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank – one of those interested in joining IIN – told Bloomberg.\nSanai agreed, saying the system makes the screening of payment recipients “faster and more efficient.”\nAs of mid November, there were approximately 365 banks signed up for the initiative from other parts of the world, according to JPMorgan's website. OCBC became the first Singapore bank to join IIN in September.

    "content": "The CEO of Swiss financial services giant UBS Group AG endorsed blockchain technology in an interview, suggesting that it is \"almost a must\" for business.\nSergio Ermotti told CNBC Monday that the technology can help companies become more efficient, thereby reducing costs for certain operations. In general, technology will help firms free up resources, but blockchain in particular \"is a great way\" to increase those efficiencies.\nHe said:\nDuring the interview, Ermotti said that the blockchain technology \"will be as crucial and disruptive, and changing as regulation was in the last 10 years.\"\nThis is not the first time Ermotti has praised blockchain technology without similarly praising cryptocurrencies. During another interview with CNBC in October, he said he was far more bullish on blockchain than he was about cryptocurrencies specifically.\nHis comments echoed those of UBS chief investment officer Mark Haefele, who referred to bitcoin as being risky last year, as previously reported by CoinDesk.\nPutting action to words, UBS is currently backing a blockchain-based trade finance platform, Batavia, in partnership with IBM. CoinDesk reported in April that the platform has conducted its first live cross-border transactions with corporate clients.\nUBS image via Shutterstock.",

    "summary": "Chef Aarón Sánchez showed us how food can hit the blockchain and our bellies.",
    "content": "Chef Aarón Sánchez and IBM teamed up at CES 2020 to create a vision of a blockchain-based food chain. IBM's Food Trust project, of which Sánchez is a part, aims to allow growers, grocers and cooks to track their food from seed to plate.\nThe system, said IBM General Manager of Blockchain Services Jason Kelley, uses the blockchain simply because it is the cheapest way to get everyone –  from the farmer in the field to a tech-loving chef like Sánchez – to connect. Rather than forcing each participant to run massive data stores or buy expensive gear, this blockchain allows for most of the interaction to happen using 3D-printed hardware and cellphones.\nSánchez is the founder of the restaurant Johnny Sanchez in New Orleans and a judge on the television show MasterChef.\nOriginally aimed at managing food supply chains for big corporations like Nestle, the new tech allows for farmers to optically or chemically scan their products using simple electronics. Then, as the food moves from farmer to supplier to kitchen, everyone involved can confirm the product matches the description. In fact, IBM showed off how its technology can \"read\" the colors in olive oil and help identify the manufacturer. One manufacturer, CHO, is already shipping its blockchain-tracked oil to Whole Foods stores.\nWe spoke with Kelley and Sánchez at CES 2020. In fact, Sánchez cooked with blockchain-tracked produce including kale and scallops.\n\"For me, I felt like there were a lot of nameless ingredients, in the sense that I didn't have the connection to the farmer necessarily,\" said Sánchez. \"Blockchain allows you to have a direct connection and a conversation through technology.\"\nSánchez served his blockchain-infused food at the event, showing us that the path to mass adoption may be through our stomachs.",

    "summary": "The largest food company by revenue has doubled down on blockchain pilots.",
    "content": "Nestlé, the largest food company by revenue, announced a pilot program to track its supply chains using blockchain, according to a company statement.\nThe firm partnered with OpenSC, a blockchain platform, to develop the distributed ledger system which will be separate and distinct from Nestlé’s ongoing participation with IBM Food Trust blockchain.\nThe pilot will last six months, and success will be determined by the “feasibility, viability and scalability of the system,” as well as how well the system verifies data, according to a Nestlé representative. Once rolled out, the service may involve a QR code, mobile app, and web portal.\n“For us, it is key that the access to the information is as seamless and easy as possible in order to have participation and traction with stakeholders and consumers,” the spokesperson said.\nThe company said the initiative is to drive the market towards transparency by providing independently verifiable data to the conglomerate’s consumers. They also believe the mechanism will improve food safety and quality control.\n“We want our consumers to make an informed decision on their choice of products – to choose products produced responsibly. Open blockchain technology might allow us to share reliable information with consumers in an accessible way,” said Magdi Batato, Nestlé Executive Vice President in a statement.\nThe program will initially track milk from farms in New Zealand to Nestlé facilities in the Middle East, and will expand to include palm oil production in the Americas. Nestlé will then determine how scalable the application is, noting that some retail items will take time to integrate.\n“With the palm oil supply chain in the America, we can experiment the system at local level. Furthermore, the product itself, being liquid, it adds more complexity to the traceability,” a company representative said to CoinDesk.\nThe data will be collected through each step of the value chain and recorded on an open platform. The company may plan to include data from other monitoring systems, such as satellite imaging of farms, according to the company representative.\n“With the open platform, any update or change made in the system can be seen by all users as it retains the original data, which cannot be deleted,” they said.\nNestlé began experimenting with blockchain in 2017 when it joined IBM Food Trust as a founding member. In April, Nestlé announced that it had begun working with Carrefour to use blockchain to track Mousline potato puree from Nestlé factories to the French retail giant’s stores.\nIn June, Carrefour attributed an increase in sales to its use of transparent tracking.\n“We want to offer consumers what they want. Consumers are more and more demanding for information related to their food. They are eager to understand where the ingredients come from, whether it has been sourced responsibly and how the food is made. Blockchain helps provide consumers trusted data collected throughout the value chain,” said the spokesperson.\n“This open blockchain technology will allow anyone, anywhere in the world to assess our responsible sourcing facts and figures,” said Benjamin Ware, Global Head of Responsible Sourcing for Nestlé.\nIBM Blockchain uses a QR barcode on a product that when scanned provides information such as date of harvest, farm location and owner, packing date, how long the item in transport, and tips on how to prepare it.\nOpenSC was founded in January by WWF-Australia and The Boston Consulting Group Digital Ventures.\nNestlé photo via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Pitch Deck Says Solana Is Courting Dish Network, Kik for Its 'Web-Scale' Blockchain",
    "summary": "Solana is looking to raise up to $12M at a $125M valuation, touting potential relationships with Dish and Kin in a pitch deck seen by CoinDesk.",
    "content": "DISH Network, a major U.S. television services provider, and Kin, the payments platform built by Kik, are reportedly looking to tap up-and-coming Solana as the basis for their blockchain networks.\nAccording to a Solana pitch deck seen by CoinDesk, which indicates the company is looking to raise at least $2 million and potentially up to $12 million, software engineers at DISH could use Solana's protocol as the basis for a tokenized 5G network that could be used to hire space on-chain for web-connected devices.\nDISH is reportedly nearing the final stages of a proof-of-concept demo that uses Solana. The television provider did not respond to a request for comment by press time.\nThere are multiple versions of Solana's pitch deck. Some say Solana is looking to raise $10 million in a strategic round, but others indicate it is only seeking $2 million in a sale of native tokens to retail investors later this month. The tokens are not currently publicly tradable. Solana is targeting a $125 million valuation with the raise.\nFounded by former Qualcomm developers in 2017, Solana claims to provide a scalable layer-1 protocol with a throughput rate hitting 50,000 TPS in tests. That's a little below the 60,000 TPS that Visa handles, according to the card payment processor's 2019 annual report.\nIt isn't just DISH that is reportedly interested in moving to Solana. Kin, the social media and payments network, might also move to Solana's blockchain network, a little over two years after first moving to Stellar.\nAccording to the pitch deck, Kin – which reportedly processes over $1 million transactions per day – has apparently \"outscaled\" Stellar and believes Solana is \"the only solution\" that will allow it to continue scaling in line with its growing user base.\nWhen mobile messenger app Kik – which is currently embroiled in an extended legal tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – hosted its $100 million Kin token sale in 2017, the project said its social media and payments platform would be based on Ethereum. But that December, Kik Chief Executive Ted Livingston announced Kin was moving to Stellar, citing Ethereum's scaling limitations.\n“Stellar was built by the guys at Ripple and the thing we like about it is it’s custom-built for an application like Kin. It’s not like Ethereum where it’s trying to be everything to everybody, and that makes it general purpose and slow,\" Livingston said at the time.\nTanner Philp, Kik's technical adviser to the CEO, told CoinDesk that migrating to a highly scalable network would enhance Kin's performance in line with increasing token network usage.\n\"Solana is one option we thought could be interesting for Kin so we have been doing some initial evaluations, but right now we have nothing to announce,\" he said.\nSolana's pitch deck claims Kin could move over to the new protocol as early as this month. Philp did not respond to CoinDesk's request for clarification on this point.\nIn July 2019, Solana raised a $20 million Series A funding round, led by Multicoin Capital, with NEO Global Capital (NGC), Distributed Global and BlockTower Capital participating. The mainnet is scheduled for launch sometime in 2020.\nA Solana spokesperson declined to comment for this article.",

The measure will now be sent to the State Senate for further deliberation.\nThe bill's provisions seek to prevent town and county governments in the state from imposing restrictions on people who run such nodes in their residences, saying that the matter \"is of statewide concern and not subject to further regulation\" in those local jurisdictions.\nWeninger's measure does not specify whether it is restricted to cryptocurrency miners, but it does state specifically that individuals using computing power to either validate or encrypt a transaction on a blockchain are protected.\nStepping back, the bill is just one of several making their way through the Arizona legislature. Another bill sponsored by Weninger would formally define the terms \"virtual coin,\" \"blockchain,\" and \"virtual coin offering\" within the state’s legal framework.\nIf passed, that particular bill, submitted earlier this month, would define when an initial coin offering (ICO) qualifies as a securities offering under existing law.\nMore significantly, however, is another bill recently passed by the Arizona Senate which would empower the state government to accept taxes in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This bill would, if approved, require Arizona's Department of Revenue to convert the cryptocurrencies into U.S. dollars within a day of receiving them as payment.\nThis bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Warren Petersen (R.-12), and Weninger is sponsoring its House equivalent. Public records indicate that the measure was given a second reading on Feb. 20.\nArizona House of Representatives image via Thomas Trompeter / Shutterstock",

We have to decide which way to go.\"\nEarlier this month, Italy signed a joint declaration along with another six southern EU states saying it would take the lead on blockchain in order to transform its economy.\nMinistry of Economic Development image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Iconloop has signed a deal with Yeolmae Company to provide a blockchain-based certificate issuance service for the company's ARTnGUIDE platform, which acts as an intermediary site for the joint ownership of art.\nThe agreement was covered heavily in the local press. It was confirmed by the company by email and by a release and via ARTnGUIDE's website.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Iconloop's 'broof' service will record the ownership of the artwork, along with the image of that work, in a manner that prevents falsification of the record. A timestamped certificate is issued that displays the image as well as a 'chop' stamp signature.\nARTnGUIDE currently has 16 jointly-owned works listed on its website. The works include five by Lee Ufan, founder of the avant-garde School of Things, and three works of Whanki Kim, an early abstract artist in Korea.\nAt present, the co-ownership of each work is recorded by utilizing an ethereum-based service. The record, which is publicly accessible, includes ownership status and a detailed change history.\nIconloop says that its offering significantly differs from the existing system as it will allow for the recording of the image. It is not clear whether the broof system will completely replace the current records platform or work along side of it.\nThe company works with a wide range of partners, including Samsung, Mirae Asset and KB Kookmin Bank. It also has a coin, ICX, which is ranked 40th globally by CoinMarketCap with a market cap of about $100 million.\nARTnGUIDE was formed in 2018. The first work purchased via ARTnGUIDE was Kim Hwan-ki's Sanwol (1963). It was acquired in October 2018 for 45 million won ($37,000) and sold about two months later for a 22 percent gain, according to the company.\nPainting via CoinDesk archives",

To simplify the process to build applications, the new service allows customers to use smart contracts templates and other functional components designed to increase efficiency.\nAccording to the company’s website, the Xuperchain network has nearly 3.5 million users and has processed over 450 million transactions. The network has seven masternodes including Tsinghua University and streaming services giant iQiyi to help and verify transactions on the platform.\nBaidu announced in May it would make its Xuperchain network open source to the public and look into the potential challenges its prospective users could encounter.\nThe new service is not the company’s first effort to help developers build their own applications. In February, Baidu Cloud launched Baidu Blockchain Engin (BBE) to tackle storage and computing issues for developers when they try to build applications.\nThe company debuted its Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform in January 2018. The platform aims to provide blockchain infrastructure for applications. However, unlike the new service, the platform requires companies and developers to have their own blockchain first.",

    "content": "Tezos Foundation, a non-profit, educational wing of the smart contract and Dapp platform, announced Roman Schnider, co-creator of PricewaterhouseCoopers Switzerland's blockchain initiative, to supercede Eelco Fiole as Chief Financial Officer.\nSchnider’s appointment to the Zug based firm will begin summer 2019, about six months after investment executive and adjunct professor of financial ethics Fiole filled the position. Fiole was hired during a period of executive expansion, which Tezos Foundation President Ryan Jesperson called at the time, “an important step forward by strengthening its internal expertise and capabilities.”\nA leader within the blockchain community since its record-setting $232 million ICO in July 2017, Tezos has also been wracked by internal and external conflict.\nThe Etherium-like distributed, peer-to-peer, permissionless network delayed the distribution of its tokens due to internal miscommunication. Additionally, three lawsuits were filed in November 2017 accusing the Tezos Foundation of false advertising and securities fraud, as XTZ tokens were sold but not registered as securities.\nSchnider first became familiar with Tezos protocol in July 2018, when he was hired to perform an independent, external audit of the firm, cited as the first time a major U.S. accounting firm worked with a large-scale blockchain organization.\nAt the time, the Tezos Foundation commented, “We believe that accountability and trust will be central pillars of any successful entity operating in the blockchain space.”\nSchnider will join the Tezos Foundation after over 14 years at PwC, where he served as financial director. In 2016, he launched the department for blockchain and cryptocurrency assurance.\n“Roman’s experience makes him the ideal finance and operations specialist for our team. He is already familiar with the opportunities and challenges blockchain projects face and has a deep understanding of the Tezos Foundation from his time at PwC Switzerland,” said Jesperson, in a statement.\nBefore joining the Tezos Foundation, Fiole spent more than twenty years in the financial services industry, including co-founding Alpha Governance Partners, an international risk-governance focused fiduciary services firm. He has not said where he will go next.\n“We want to thank Eelco for his contribution to the development of the Foundation and wish him all the best,\"Jesperson said.\nTezos currently has a market cap of $812,826,137 and sits at 19 in token rank on CoinMarketCap.",

    "content": "A new blockchain-powered startup led by three physical scientists promises to paint the world in diamond dust.\nDUST Identity's service, known as DUST Ledger, allows users to enroll all manner of physical objects onto a blockchain, the founders claim. The system uses a product called the Diamond Unclonable Security Tag (DUST), a coating that uniquely identifies an object when it's placed under a scanner. The coating is tagged to the specific object, be it a shipping container or transistor, allowing users to track the product's provenance around the world, DUST Identity says.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nThe team announced Monday that it is now part of the SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain, allowing that service's enterprise users to paint their objects and enroll them on the ledger at will. Plans start at $3,600 a month for users who want to try the tech.\nThe company previously raised $2.3 million from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and also got cash from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, for its work in logistics and tracking.\nOne of the co-founders, Ophir Gaathon, has a deep background in diamond materials and received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Columbia University. His partners, MIT professor>Dirk Englund, and MIT Ph.D. Jonathan Hodges, have backgrounds in quantum photonics and optical system design, respectively.\nInitially, they joined forces to figure out how to use diamonds in quantum computers.\n\"It was clear that there are several very interesting applications that can be greatly impacted by the use of diamonds,\" said Gaathon. \"However, we realized that, for any commercial application, there are three fundamental things that we need to tackle first: know how to make and nanoengineer diamonds at scale, how develop the hardware technology that can 'talk' to our diamonds, and how to build an intuitive software interface platform that will enable any user to extract value from our diamonds.\"\nFor the third part, DUST turned to the blockchain – specifically, a private one built using the Hyperledger Fabric platform.\n\"We started to look at the security threats facing supply chains – specifically how electronic parts that can jeopardize defense platforms and critical assets,\" said Gaathon. \"We found that, in many cases, the issue (and cause of friction) is that the parts or the data about the parts (or both) are difficult or impossible to identify, link, and trust. Trusted physical identity was simply missing. So we decided to build it. And that's how DUST was born.\"\nDUST competes with other, more-established products like near-field communication (NFC) tags and other nano-coatings. But if the blockchain lives up to its promises, perhaps in the near future diamonds will be a logistician's best friend.\nDUST scanner image via DUST Ledger",

Each job description either calls for experience with blockchain tech or the ability to apply it in a banking context.\nA recently closed ad on LinkedIn also suggests the bank has plans to use Ripple's distributed ledger-based payments network in some form. The post for a treasury product manager indicates the role \"leads the product management team for the Ripple Project.\"\nThe new hire would be responsible for \"driving product strategy and growth, overseeing daily product management routines, and overseeing the development of new initiatives that result in an innovative and highly-competitive product offering.\"\nBank of America did not respond to requests for comment by press time.\nThe lender is also a member of the Marco Polo trade finance blockchain consortium, founded by startups R3 and Trade IX.\nIn March, the bank’s chief technology officer, Cathy Bessant, told CNBC that she’s bearish on the technology and that the patents exist only so that the bank can pivot to blockchain quickly if the need arises.\nThat pivot may be coming sooner rather than later. In an application filed in March 2018 and published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) this month, the bank requested a patent for a permissioned blockchain to record internet-of-things (IoT) node data.\nEach of the enterprise payment technology senior architect positions requires experience in \"crypto-technologies,\" a category under which Bank of America includes IoT and blockchain.\nBank of America image via Shutterstock.",

Ultimately, he is seeking to position Ohio as a possible hub for companies working with the tech.\nSmith said:\nAs CoinDesk reported previously, Ohio introduced a bill back in May which sought to treat blockchain data and smart contracts as electronic records, as an effort to make the state a safe harbor for blockchain.\nThat measure was ultimately approved and signed by Gov. John Kasich, making Ohio one of a growing number of states that recognize the legal status of data stored on blockchain.\nOhio state capitol image via Shutterstock",

In its 184-page action plan released March 2, U.K.’s post-Brexit trade broker said it will “seek to deliver” favorable digital trade terms for small to midsize businesses, including those in blockchain.\n“In areas such as data flows, blockchain, driverless cars and quantum technology we have the opportunity to help shape global rules through ambitious digital trade provisions,” the document states.\nThe document did not provide any actual details, and DIT declined to elaborate on its negotiating stance ahead of the talks. Such discussions have taken on heightened importance post-Brexit, especially given the U.K.’s already close trading ties with the U.S.\nPeter Hunn, CEO of the smart contracts API firm Clause, said a deal could be beneficial for the blockchain space.\n“There is a lot that can be done here to provide standardized interfaces using DLT systems and smart contract code that reduce administration, financial and compliance burdens,” he said.\nDIT appears to have prioritized striking a strong digital trading partnership within its coming framework. An entire chapter of the negotiating objectives deal with “digital trade” including data protection, an open internet and cross-border data flows, among other issues.\nThe U.K. seeks to “future-proof the agreement in anticipation of rapid technological developments,” according to an accompanying press release.\nThere are some calls for closer cross-border crypto partnerships within the report. In an included appendix that summarizes the DIT’s trade agreement public comment period, held in summer 2018, some “business associations” are said to have lobbied DIT for closer fintech ties.",

The goal is to monitor and, eventually, expand the reach of a particular ad, according to a press release.\nThe campaign, which started two weeks ago, has featured five of AB InBev's most popular brands, including Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, Limeatrita and Estrellas.\nThe campaign is built around Kiip's new blockchain product, which is designed to enhance transparency and tackle issues like mobile ad fraud by keeping the campaign database available to all players in mobile ad sales.\nDifferent metrics - including impressions, engagement and price - are encoded on the ethereum blockchain, and AB InBev can track these ad activities every hour. This approach reduces the amount of time that the campaign's organizers spend in tracking the metrics. Meanwhile, the ad buyers can pay only for the ads that meet their criteria.\nThe new ad system is only AB InBev's latest move into the crypto space. The Belgium-based behemoth joined a consortium to experiment with the blockchain technology for global shipping uses in March, as previously reported by CoinDesk.\nImage Credit: Shi Yali / Shutterstock.com",

    "content": "A series of ongoing efforts across universities, medical academia, the private sector and even private citizens are harnessing distributed systems in the fight against COVID-19.\nThe projects are attempting to buttress governmental stay-at-home orders that have frozen billions of people in a global effort to flatten the curve. There's no known cure for COVID-19 and there will be no vaccine against the coronavirus that causes it for at least a year, leaving medical practitioners, researchers and innovators to try and find ways of mitigating its impact – and blockchain boosters are finding new fronts to pitch in.\nOne such avenue is in contact tracing. Hasshi Sudler, an adjunct professor with Villanova University's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is leading development of a permissioned blockchain for doctors to trace positive COVID-19 cases, possibly getting ahead of future outbreaks.\n“Medical institutions, whether they know each other or not, whether they trust each other or not, can exchange information about who they know that is infected and maintain contact with who is infected,” over the blockchain, Sudler told CoinDesk.\nThe need is clear: A number of countries instituted lockdowns to prevent the virus’s spread, leading to massive unemployment numbers and a likely recession.\nThe Villanova project is still in its early stages, but around the world other initiatives are racing ahead, or already deployed.\nIn Berlin, startup Spherity has developed a decentralized identity system to help patients keep their social distance while getting medication. Honduran authorities have deployed a blockchain-backed app to track and manage stay-at-home orders.\nSix thousand ethereum miners are now contributing to Stanford University’s Folding@home distributed computing project, which pools GPU power to search for a COVID-19 cure.\nAcademia, too, has begun prodding for novel blockchain pandemic applications. An April 5 submission to the journal Diagnostics proposed a combined blockchain and AI system for self testing.\nLong way to go\nThe cross-industry efforts remain a small part of the fight against the pandemic.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – a critical institution in the U.S. fight against COVID-19 – highlighted the potential for digital technologies to help combat pandemics in a Monday blog post.\nCDC’s post cited two March 27 articles in the journal Nature Medicine that discussed technology in the context of COVID-19. The first commentary mashed up “four inter-related technologies” – internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics and blockchain – and dove into each tech’s surveillance and mitigation capacity. The second weighed responsible technology use against public health imperatives.\nAuthors of the CDC post implicitly endorsed many of the first article’s stated digital technologies by giving examples for each one’s use. AI could help detect COVID-19 cases or develop vaccines; big data could help model viral outbreaks; IoT could be a powerful avenue for public health data collection, but, as the second article noted, would force thorny questions about privacy and ethics.\n“Control of pandemics can require unusual steps that must be measured and limited to the scope of the outbreak to prevent overreach,” CDC authors wrote.\nBlockchain’s likely impact was detailed in the first cited Nature Medicine commentary. There, authors predicted that blockchain would have a low likely impact in vaccine manufacture and insurance processes, and a moderate likely impact in the distribution of medication, which researchers said was already happening in Chinese hospitals.\n“Through the use of blockchain, hospitals could ensure timely delivery of medications with accurate tracking,” the Nature Medicine authors wrote.",

    "content": "Crypto startup Knabu is piloting bank regulatory reporting with Factom, one of the earliest enterprise blockchain companies.\nRevealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the London-based firm is launching the 30-day pilot today.\nKnabu is best known as a payments company with a smart-deposit product meant to help companies mitigate the risks of self-custodying assets on a blockchain. It is simultaneously applying for a UK banking license, aiming to establish itself as a bank that can serve crypto and blockchain firms normally excluded from traditional banking services.\n“The purpose of the pilot is to start proving some of the efficiencies that blockchain brings – specifically as core infrastructure for a bank,” Gabrielle Patrick, founder and CEO of Knabu, told CoinDesk, adding:\nCompliance costs for banks are high because of how many manual processes have to be repeated. Knabu will run know-your-customer (KYC), know-your-business (KYB) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks on customers, encrypt the data, and send it to Factom to be recorded on the ethereum and bitcoin blockchains.\n“We wanted to avoid repeating the same KYC, KYB and AML checks,” Hakim Mamoni, chief technology officer and co-founder of Knabu, told CoinDesk. “[Traditional banks] don’t have the same flexibility in terms of having access to the data.”\nAs a part of wanting to bank other underserved companies, Patrick is interested in also serving small-to-medium enterprises as well as fintech startups.\nThe only customer pilot participant that Knabu would name is crypto trading platform EthBits. IdentityMind will perform Knabu’s KYC and KYB checks while DMG Blockchain will use blockchain forensic tools like Blockseer and Walletscore to perform AML due diligence on customer bitcoin and ethereum wallets.\nThe Factom blockchain builds data chains and then preserves them on the ethereum and bitcoin blockchains using a Merkle root. Factom’s service, which in the past was operated by customers using factoid tokens, is being run entirely by Factom with Knabu pushing data to the firm using an application programming interface (API).\n“This allows us to be able to borrow the security that you get from the power of the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains to verify that your data is what you claim it to be,” Carl DiClementi, vice president of product at Factom, told CoinDesk.\nKnabu CEO Patrick says the pilot is in line with work from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority exploring ways in which financial institutions can digitize regulatory reporting. In the future, Knabu aims to also test reporting capital reserves on Factom’s blockchain.\n“The goal is to rip out any inefficiency and to serve underserved businesses,” Patrick said, adding:\nBank image via Shutterstock",

The system would be designed to be shared between relevant financial institutions as well as the BOK and the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), Korea's financial watchdog.\nThe BOK is unlikely to launch a blockchain bond system until it has greater regulatory clarity on whether it would be ultimately responsible for any failure or accidents, the report reads.\nThe Korean bond market is one of the largest markets in Asia, according to financial data site Cbonds. The government regularly issues debt, which can be purchased by foreign investors. The country has rapidly become a regional leader with the advent of responsible bonds, such as green bonds, where issuances rose to more than $6 billion by June 2019, $2 billion ahead of China.\nThe BOK is said to have been inspired by the World Bank, which has raised a total of US$108 million through two bond sales held on a private version of the ethereum blockchain, together with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nIt's uncertain whether the BOK's proposed blockchain initiative would only be integrated with government-issued debt, or whether it could be expanded to include corporate debt as well.

But as blockchain technology begins to break down borders and empower the unbanked, Zarate is growing concerned it might also be weaponized to illicit ends.\nZarate told CoinDesk:\nTo be clear, Zarate supports the idea that blockchain and cryptocurrencies could give \"greater autonomy\" to individuals, while potentially boosting \"commercial activity.\"\nNow a senior adviser at Washington D.C.-based think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and chairman of the Financial Integrity Network, Zarate was also among the technology's earliest advocates, having been an advisor to U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase since 2014.\nStill, he's adamant there needs to be more transparency about how even governments might use blockchain due to the geo-political nature of the monetary system it could help reimagine.\nKey to the success of the tools Zarate created, for example, was the U.S. dollar's status as the de facto global reserve currency. By creating ways to strategically cut off a nation's access to the dollar, Zarate was able to effectively restrict their ability to wage war or otherwise undermine U.S. interests.\nIn his 2013 book, \"Treasury's War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare,\" Zarate wrote a detailed account of these tools, but also ended with a stark warning about what he called the \"coming financial wars,\" in which the tools he helped create might be used against his own country.\nAnd even though he identifies as a blockchain advocate, in interview, he outlined multiple examples of how state actors are already experimenting with the technology for illicit uses, in the process painting a vivid picture of what could go wrong.\nSanctions evasion\nTo date, the largest and most real threat of blockchain is its ability to help nation-states evade sanctions, according to Zarate.\nAlready, a Swedish startup has been granted a business license to build an infrastructure explicitly designed to help countries evade potential sanctions, with the stated goal of giving investors the ability to back \"good, hard-working companies and individuals\" in Iran.\nMost recently, multiple reports by cybersecurity firms indicated that North Korea was amassing a \"war-chest\" of bitcoin to evade sanctions. Later, a South Korea official formally accused North Korea of stealing cryptocurrency worth \"billions of won.\"\nIndeed, Iran's own temporary sanctions relief has been recently called into question by U.S. President Donald Trump, who last month expanded what are considered strict sanctions against North Korea.\nZarate didn't comment specifically on the potential impact of such sanctions for the number of startups that have launched and are using blockchain solutions as a way to simplify international investment.\nStill, he struck a perhaps forboding tone about what he sees as their possibly misguided intents.\nZarate said:\nGovernment exploration\nAnd Zarate sees a wide range of potential risks.\nSince much of the success of Zarate's sanctions tools relied on the influence of the U.S. dollar as a global standard, anything that undermines that influence could undermine the tools.\nSimply put, the possible threat is that value from state-backed fiat currencies could be siphoned off into cryptocurrencies that aren't technically limited by any borders, thereby undermining the issuers' ability to influence monetary policy.\nWhile the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has said it is unlikely that cryptocurrency would ever impact that ability, central banks and lawmakers around the world are still exploring or seeking to explore this theory.\nAnd though much of that work appears to be benign in nature, other central banks with a history of corruption allegations are also seeking out use cases.\nIt is, of course, possible that these banks are merely exploring cryptocurrencies as a way to increase transparency and perhaps expand the trust of the international community. But one, Venezuela, plans to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency, and it has already come out with the overt objective of circumventing \"financial blockades.\"\n\"We have to be very conscious of the fact that there are actors in the system, both state and non-state that may be willing to disrupt that system,\" said Zarate. \"They may be willing to use new technologies to actually undermine those very systems to affect the U.S. economy and to affect other economies, and frankly, even to profit from it.\"\nResponsible adoption\nIf Zarate has one message then, it's perhaps a warning about possible unforeseen consequences of the technology.\nAlready this week, U.S. lawmakers appear to be growing concerned about the possibilities, too, having convened representatives from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to answer questions on the issue in Washington, D.C.\nUnsurprisingly, questions at the event focused on financial stability. And while both the heads of the CFTC and the SEC indicated they see cryptocurrencies as a low risk, they acknowledged this was likely due to the nascent state of the market.\nZarate draws a similar conclusion, but is perhaps more focused on what happens when that variable changes, and blockchains and cryptocurrencies aren't so academic anymore.\n\"I'm incredibly optimistic about these technologies, but having witnessed failures in the past of regulation and recognition of risk, and cascading risk, I want to make sure that with adoption comes evaluation of where those risks lie,\" said Zarate, concluding:\nJuan Zarate image via Financial Integrity Network",

    "summary": "Sixteen million in Series A for a crypto upstart that has already courted Galaxy Digital and Genesis Global Trading.",
    "content": "Fireblocks, a platform for securing digital assets in transit, announced today $16 million in Series A funding from investment heavyweights including Cyberstarts, Tenaya Capital, and Eight Roads -- the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International. The additional capital will enable the company to build out its infrastructure, and court additional firms.\nSeveral influential customers like Galaxy Digital and Genesis Global Trading have already switched to Fireblocks to safeguard the transmission of their digital assets across exchanges, over the counter brokerages, hot wallets, and cold storage.\nSpurred to action following a series of high-profile hacks, founders Michael Shaulov and Pavel Berengoltz aimed to eliminate the root cause of digital asset hacks and scams, i.e. private key theft, spoofing, and compromised credentials.\nShaulov told CoinDesk, he and his colleague from Lacoon Mobile Security -- which was acquired by Check Point in April 2015 -- “reprioritized” their target clients from “traditional financial infrastructure to crypto,” following the “clearly sophisticated hacking by true professionals, including nation states.”\nWhat they built -- along security engineers from Symantec, Trusteer, IBM security and leading cryptography advisor, Prof. Ran Canetti -- was a cloud-based security platform that eliminates the hassle of copy and pasting addresses and enables the seamless flow of funds.\n“While Blockchain based assets by themselves are cryptographically secure, moving digital assets is a nightmare. After interviewing over 100 institutional customers, including hedge funds, broker-dealers, exchanges, and banks, we concluded that the current process is slow and highly susceptible to cyber attacks and human errors,” Shaulov said in a statement.\nFireblocks enables digital assets to be easily transitioned from any state of storage and primed for immediate settlement and transfer on the blockchain using chip-level security and MPC technology. The platform also allows the use of several layers of security including passwords, biometrics, and two-factor identification, which have become industry standard.\nWhat sets Fireblocks apart, however, is the level of programmable control available to client accounts. The platform allows for tranches of authorization and access among those using the service to control the flow -- in terms of timing and amount -- of transactions. This allows financial institutions that have different types of employees, from traders to operations managers, all with access to digital funds, to set different permissions for different scenarios.\nAt issue was a matter of speed as much as security. Shaulov said, “New uses of blockchain cannot rely on gaps in service. [Investors] need assets to be available, interactable, and transferable.”\n“There was a need to take assets, either native to the blockchain or tokenized assets or securities, and move, trade, sell them in a reasonably fast time frame,” Shaulov said. “Keeping assets locked down in cold storage like a traditional custodian is antithetical in the way [investment firms dealing in crypto] operate.”\nFireblocks released its product last quarter and has already overseen hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital asset transfers, according to Shaulov. “The technology itself can be used for any financial use case of blockchain.”\nThe company is integrated with 15 digital asset exchanges and offers support for over 180 cryptocurrencies, tokens, and stablecoins. Shaulov added that he’d like to build the infrastructure used by small and large merchants as they adoption of digital assets as a payment method becomes widespread.\nFidelity image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Brazil’s major financial regulators have unified their intelligence troves under a blockchain-backed sharing system called PIER.",
    "content": "Brazil’s financial regulators launched an information-sharing blockchain platform called PIER on Wednesday.\nAt launch, the blockchain pulls data from three of Brazil’s four major financial institutions: the private insurance superintendent (SUSEP), the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) and securities regulator (CVM), PIER’s main backers. Social security supervisor PREVIC also plans to join.\nOnce it does, PIER will unite Brazil’s entire financial oversight ecosystem in what CVM called “a vast integrated database” that accelerates the speed with which each can administer its slice of Brazil’s $1.9 trillion economy – Latin America’s largest by far.\nOne use of the platform would be to conduct background checks on political appointees, according to BCB.\n“Our objective is that this system promotes gains to the market, given the more efficient, safe and adequate supervision and enforcement to the new technological scenario that we are experiencing” said CVM President Marcelo Barbosa in a press release.\nPIER grants bureaucrats access to their sister agencies’ real-time records on company sanctions, financial performance and business associates “in seconds,” according to BCB. It’s an easy, online bridge between previously siloed data troves.\n\"This makes it possible to drastically reduce the time period for assessing requirements,\" said Daniel Bichuette, deputy head of the BCB’s Financial System Organization Department, in the press release.\nEach agency envisions using PIER to improve their oversight efficiency. For example, BCB said in a press release that PIER can streamline its vetting of elected officials appointed to financial institution posts – specifically the examination of their qualifications and business reputation. The central bank is charged with conducting such investigations.\nCVM, for its part, said PIER can boost corporate investigations.\nThe project is expected to reduce the time it takes to conduct cross-regulator investigations as well as the cost. CVM did not immediately respond to requests for hard numbers.\nIt's also being seen as a more secure means of storing information.\n\"Building PIER, using blockchain, allows the use of decentralized, tested technology whose native functionalities mean that there is no need to build the system from scratch,\" BCB software manager Eduardo Weller said in the press release.\nBased on BCB’s description of PIER, the underlying blockchain appears to utilize a consensus-based mechanism with multiple nodes and a digital signature system. BCB did not immediately respond to requests for a deeper technical overview.\nBCB will add yet more government databases to PIER over time, saying the system \"has the potential to aggregate databases from outside the financial system,\" the press release said. Possible additions include data from: \"judiciary, trade boards and international financial stability bodies.\"\nPIER’s debut is two years in the making. BCB, which first developed PIER and now administers it, disclosed PIER's existence in June 2018. Project lead Gabriela Ruberg did not respond to a request for comment.\nBrazil’s financial sector often looks to blockchain’s potential. Private banks have issued security tokens on the Tezos blockchain and minted Brazilian real-backed stablecoins on Ethereum. As the PIER press release notes: “The use of Blockchain in financial services has been growing in the market.”\nThe regulators, and especially BCB, have been similarly bullish. The four now running PIER launched a blockchain sandbox in June 2019.\nThis embrace of blockchain’s technological potential comes in striking contrast to its wider views on cryptocurrency. BCB officials have likened bitcoin to a pyramid scheme. Even so, they have stressed that the tech is different from its individual applications.",

It also referred to cryptocurrencies and ICOs for financing.\nBrazil currently has the highest number of cryptocurrency holders in Latin America and occupies the fifth position globally. Experts estimate that 8% of Brazil’s population will own some form of cryptoasset by 2019.\nThe new regulatory initiative comes after the announcement of regulation on cryptocurrencies earlier this year by the Financial Supervision Counsel of Brazil. In this case, the regulation follow the same rules as in money laundering, with fines as high as $5 million for scofflaws.\nLooking for recognition\nAs regulatory efforts defining the limits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology use in business, an increasing number of Brazilian merchants that work with cryptocurrencies still lack proper classification in the financial market.\nThe lack of recognition by financial entities sabotages the growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency, keeping new businesses from properly participating in the fintech space. Representatives in the field pointed out that despite regulations, banks still can close or deny bank accounts to businesses that work with new, untested financial technologies.",

    "content": "Summa co-founder James Prestwich wants to bridge the great divide: bitcoin vs. ethereum.\nNow his firm is teaming up with fellow blockchain startup Keep to launch the Cross-Chain Working Group, which aims to create a protocol for using bitcoin on ethereum-based systems.\nThe group hosted its first meeting on Thursday with more than 40 participants, including curious representatives from interoperability protocol Cosmos and Ripple’s investment arm, Xpring.\n“The goal is to provide a platform for developers, other than those employed by a base chain, who work across chains,” Prestwich told CoinDesk.\nHe said nearly 10 other companies have applied to join this group making tools for developers to work across blockchains, although official membership is yet to be determined.\n“It’s a wrapper but it’s a fully decentralized wrapper. I’d actually call it a new sidechain mechanism,” Matt Luongo, CEO of Keep’s parent company, Thesis, told CoinDesk. “It gives your a trustless peg, a supply peg, between the two chains.”\nIn short, the bitcoin is deposited with a smart contract that requires multiple signatures to unlock funds. Key holders lock up crypto collateral, like ether, which the depositor can seize if the holders misbehave. In the meantime, the depositor is essentially given a crypto equivalent of ethereum-compatible tokens that represent the bitcoin, called tBTC.\nAs such, the user can conduct ethereum transactions like taking a collateralized debt position with MakerDAO’s stablecoin DAI, yet eventually cash out the results as bitcoin. There is clearly demand for dollar-pegged DAI loans, which are generally liquidated for fiat then paid back to unlock the crypto collateral. According to DeFi Pulse, there is roughly $256 million worth of crypto locked in MakerDAO loans alone.\n“Now bitcoiners can get loans and get access to DAI,” Luongo said. “All of us being able to get access to the equity of our bitcoin holdings would be pretty powerful.”\nIt takes a village\nThesis investor Charlie Noyes of Paradigm told CoinDesk tBTC represents “a meaningful improvement over previous efforts to make bitcoin more extensible,” without compromising on bitcoin’s security or decentralized ethos.\nThe working group’s goal is to launch an ethereum-based tester app with access to bitcoin this fall and a tBTCmainnet by Q4. Keep investor Olaf Carlson-Wee of Polychain Capital told CoinDesk he sees this protocol as “critical infrastructure” for the broader ecosystem.\n“Different blockchains, instead of being siloed, will be able to communicate with one another and interact with one another,” Carlson-Wee said. “When you think longer term, is the start of a universe of interaction across blockchains … where tokens can freely move across blockchains. This is the first step toward that inevitable future.”\nSpeaking of the motivation behind forming this group to make tBTCl, rather than both startups doing it proprietarily, Luongo concluded:\nSumma founder James Prestwich at the first Cross-Chain Working Group meeting in San Francisco (photo via Keep)",

    "content": "Avenir Suisse, one of the most influential think tanks in Switzerland, released a report urging the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to start working on a national cryptocurrency.\nThe report, called “Blockchain After the Hype,” proposes an economic model based on the blockchain. It suggests that the next step is to move forward with the creation of a \"franc token\" controlled by the SNB.\nAccording to the new model suggested by Avenir Suisse, developing a stablecoin could convert Switzerland into a “blockchain nation.” The publication presents this goal as a way to upgrade the Swiss financial sector by enabling the trade of cryptoassets.\n“It would facilitate tokenized securities trading if the National Bank and major players in the industry were to drive the development of a Swiss franc token,” the report reads.\nAlso, the centralized asset would be a door to blockchain use in other areas of the financial industry, mainly trade finance and new business models. The approach will help Switzerland move ahead of its peers in Europe while expanding global market possibilities.\n“If it manages to position itself internationally as a pioneer in trading tokenized securities, Switzerland will be able to expand its relatively small capital market,” Avenir Suisse wrote.\nMore Action, Less Talk\nThe need for a cryptocurrency comes after a year of back and forth from the SNB about the impact of cryptocurrency and its plans to use distributed ledger technology to create trading platforms for tokens.\nThe publication also presses for the necessity of a framework for blockchain and cryptocurrency. The think tank recommends that laws must be made adaptable to these technologies.\n“Essentially the law should be changed only in areas where it’s not yet DLT-compatible. But these changes have to be made as soon as possible.”, the think tank says.\nIn the mean time, the SNB's stand towards crypto adoption is still on neutral ground after recently hosting the Conference on Cryptoassets and Financial Innovation.\nSwitzerland is known for its open policy on blockchain experimentation, but the think tank argues that the time for trials is over and that the institutions must move forward.\n“Switzerland now has to take the next step in the development of DLT, morphing from the much-vaunted “Crypto Valley” into a fully-fledged DLT nation,” Avenir Suisse said.",

    "summary": "A team of Russian engineers and entrepreneurs wants to link heavy-duty delivery drones using blockchain.",
    "content": "A metal frame with four small and two large propellers – carrying a container the size of a refrigerator – rises into the air with a roar, hovering above an empty road amidst snowy fields.\nThe video was shot on the airfield near the Russian city of Kazan, which is located to the south-east of Moscow, and the machine is a SKYF drone, designed by a team of Russian aviation engineers.\nAccording to its makers, the drone can carry up to 880 pounds, travel as far as 220 miles and work up to 8 hours. And everything that happens to these drones is going to be recorded on the project's own blockchain, SKYFchain.\nThe SKYF team is trying to crack into a rapidly growing ecosystem, with PwC valuing the emerging global market for drones at over $127 billion in 2016. As of today, drones can only carry small objects, but the SKYF team aims to open a totally new market for heavy-duty cargo drones.\nThe idea is that they'll serve multiple purposes, such as delivering large amounts of cargo, fighting fires and spraying insecticides and fertilizers on agricultural lands.\nSKYF is a decidedly Russian project. The drones are being produced domestically by OKB Aviareshenia Ltd., a subsidiary of British entity ARDN Technologies. Both entities were founded by the same team of engineers and tech entrepreneurs: Aleksander Timofeev and Ilya Rodin – managing partners of the FPI venture fund – engineers Dmitry Arsentyev, Marat Sabirov and Nail Zinnurov, and others.\nTo financially support the project, the team is holding an initial coin offering (ICO). In February, Skyfdrones Services OU, a company registered in Estonia by Alexander Timofeev, registered the token sale with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Form D (Rule 506(c)) exemption, declaring a goal to raise $30 million.\nRecently, this plan was adjusted – thus far, the project has managed to raise around $6 million, and they plan to raise some $500,000 more before the end of the ICO. Timofeev told CoinDesk that 45 percent of the funds will be spent on R&D.\nTrusted delivery\nAccording to Ilya Rodin, SKYF's GR manager, the use of blockchain in this context is aimed at creating a trust layer between stakeholders, including public and private sector interests.\n\"We need a blockchain to create trust between the counterparts: the banks, leasing and insurance companies, drone manufacturers and users, government agencies, licensing bodies, self-regulating organizations, and so on,\" Rodin told CoinDesk.\nThe idea is that the data being stored will encompass various pieces of information about the drones. This includes information about what licenses the manufacturers possess, the drones' flight paths, their performance and data on the people operating them.\n\"Drones are a new thing, banks don't know how to evaluate them and calculate interest rates for them, how to monitor their use,\" added Olga Budnik, a PR director of ARDN. \"So they would rather deny a loan or a leasing agreement than take a risk. And we give them a tool to follow the entire life of a drone.\"\nThe idea for the startup came about in 2014, when Dmitry Arsentyev was trying to create a flying motorbike – but in the end, he wound up working on an industrial drone with Sabirov and Zinnurov. Soon after, they got investment and support from FPI back in 2014, Inc. magazine wrote.\n\"Initially, the guys had a prototype of a self-piloting flying taxi,\" Alexander Timofeev explained. \"We realized that the system was new and viable, but we convinced them to transform it into an unmanned cargo platform.\"\nTimofeev believes that drone delivery will be in demand in the areas with bad road infrastructure. This is especially the case in places like northern Russia and the banks of large Siberian rivers, where bridges are far apart from one another and getting from one side to the other using road vehicles means miles of extra driving.\nPutting drones to work\nEven though things are in the early stage, the startup is pushing ahead with its ambitious plans for its blockchain-connected fleet.\nAt the heart of the project is the token, which the team says will serve a key role in managing the fleet.\n\"From the start of SKYFchain the SKYF drone autopilot will require authorization in the SKYFchain to lift off,\" the project's white paper states.\nARDN has manufactured three drones so far, but the plan is that, by 2021, there will be more than 1100 SKYF drones operating worldwide. Looking farther, the aim is for other manufacturers of air-borne, sea-borne, and ground-borne cargo drones to join the SKYFchain network.\nAnd within that time, the project's backers hope to see as many as 12.5 million transactions made on their purpose-built blockchain.\nWhat's more, company has already secured partnerships with Vietnamese port ITC, a Chinese delivery company ZTO Express and a number of Russian entities, including agricultural, delivery and oil and gas companies, as well as the Department of Transportation of the Far East region of Khabarovsk, ARDN says.\nThe parties involved have signed preliminary agreements to test the SKYF drones for possible applications in their businesses.\nDrone image via SKYFchain website",

    "content": "Telecommunications giant China Mobile is trying to show everyday consumers the value of blockchain by incorporating the technology into an ordinary household product.\nThe company’s internet of things (IoT) unit has developed a water purifier with a built-in computing chip and an IoT module. Like other IoT-connected devices, it will collect data on user behavior, which will be valuable to manufacturers and suppliers.\nBut according to Xiao Yi, a product market director at China Mobile IoT, this smart appliance will stand apart from most by giving consumers something in return for their data – and that’s where blockchain comes in.\nDepending on how long and how frequently consumers use the product, they will earn a blockchain token called PWMC, which they can then redeem for replacement filters, or to purchase other goods.\nThis rewards system will provide an incentive for usage that’s lacking in other IoT products, Xiao said, while at the same time make blockchain relatable for the average person who doesn’t spend all day trading cryptocurrency.\n“Our goal is to also attract those who are not in the cryptocurrency or blockchain community, who may have heard of this technology but not necessarily understand it,” Xiao told CoinDesk, adding:\nTo be sure, the water purifier is far from a mass-market product. Right now, it is available only through a one-month crowdfunding campaign on Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, with a goal to raise 200,000 yuan or $30,000 by Jan. 21. (Buyers will receive only the device; the tokens must be earned by using it.)\nThe sale is being conducted by Chain Infinity, a company based in Guangzhou that was jointly created by China Mobile’s IoT division, as well as Jingtum and MOAC, two China-based blockchain startups.\nThe project was initiated around the end of 2017. Aside from incentivizing user participation with tokens, Xiao said a key purpose for China Mobile IoT to move into blockchain is the technology’s unique feature of recording data in a tamper-proof fashion.\nThe devices feature both computing chips and IoT modules so that they’re connected to the internet without relying on wi-fi, and can run as individual nodes so that consumers’ usage information can be transacted and recorded on a distributed network.\nAccording to Xiao, this data will be recorded on SWTC, a public blockchain built on the byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm launched by China Mobile’s technical partner Jingtum.\nBut wait, there’s more...\nThe water purifiers follow a line of blockchain-enabled televisions that China Mobile rolled out for sale via Chain Infinity on Nov. 11, China’s equivalent to the U.S. Thanksgiving Black Friday sale.\nSimilarly, the TVs incorporate IoT modules and computing chips that connect to the SWTC network as individual nodes for recording information about user behavior.\nFurther, by setting up the TVs, consumers activate a cloud mining contract for the bitcoin network that Chain Infinity has signed with mining farms. Depending on the models, the contract period could last from two to three years, after which a certain amount of bitcoin are promised to the TV owner as a return.\nAnd since all the assets will be stored in crypto wallets created by accounts registered on Chain Infinity, Xiao said they can be used either for buying other consumer goods available on the store or to be exchanged against each other.\n“Based on existing laws, exchanging tokens for tokens or for tangible goods is not illegal, so long as you don’t exchange those into money,” Xiao said. “And China Mobile has SIM cards, pre-paid packages and other consumer stuff. You can either use the tokens directly, or participate in a flexible and yet compliant barter.”\nIn September 2017, the People’s Bank of China notably issued a ban on initial coin offering activities as well as fiat-t-crypto spot trading. Yet since then, over-the-counter and crypto-to-crypto trading have still been accessible to Chinese investors.\nChina Mobile is one of the three large state-owned telecommunications companies in China. Founded in 2006, China Mobile IoT is a fully owned subsidiary that has rolled out various consumer modules and enterprise solutions to enable mobile connectivity for houseware products such as cars and cameras.\nXiao said the water purifier and the TV are the first steps of its blockchain experiment. Further, China Mobile has also signed a partnership agreement with MOAC, another public blockchain project that launched its network in April 2018, to launch a standardized enterprise solution for combining IoT modules and blockchain computing chips.\nThe goal, according to Xiao, would be licensing such technology to other enterprises that are interested in rolling out similar blockchain-enabled IoT products.\nThat said, he added that, depending on the general user’s habits, this concept may not apply to every type of IoT device. Xiao concluded:\nChina Mobile image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Bitcoin Dissident Sees Dark Warnings in China's Blockchain Push",
    "summary": "Grave concerns about the evolution of blockchain technology from someone who lived in China and used bitcoin for its censorship-resistant value.",
    "content": "China’s recent multi-front embrace of blockchain technology has divided the global cryptocurrency community. While some see it as helpful validation, others worry that crypto is diverging further from its anti-authoritarian roots.\nAuthorities in China have long discouraged investment in grassroots cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But the world’s most populous country is making significant progress with plans for a national cryptocurrency that could increase the government’s surveillance powers over the economy.\nCoinDesk spoke with one anonymous bitcoiner who grew up in China and has since moved elsewhere in East Asia. Far from seeing blockchain “adoption” as a march toward liberation, he expects the government to use such technologies to increase its control over the population. After all, the propaganda office for China’s Communist Party announced a blockchain-based application over the weekend that allows members to pledge their allegiance to the party.\nGiven China’s mass detention centers currently being used to “re-educate” over a million Chinese Muslims, this bitcoiner feared local minorities will face even harsher conditions under a fully integrated financial system controlled by the government.\nWhat follows is a condensed transcript of the interview with this greybeard bitcoiner, a programmer who started following the project in 2014.\nThe text has been edited for clarity. We agreed to keep the identity of this person secret because he feared repercussions for his family.\nQ: What do you think about the recent “pro-blockchain” announcements coming out of China?\nIt terrifies the crap out of me.\nCrypto is technology is just like nuclear fusion is just technology: You can use it to create nuclear generators that might benefit a lot of humanity, or you can use it to create atomic bombs. We do need to think about ethics when it comes to these things.\nIf the value is something a totalitarian state can take hold of and use to track every single person and what they’re doing, enforcing the strictest currency controls, then this is what they are going to do.\nQ: Why do you think there are so many people celebrating such news this as a positive indicator for “adoption” in the crypto community?\nPeople in East Asia are very comfortable with the idea that the government is like our parents, that they’ll take care of us.\nEven if they read novels like Brave New World or 1984, the world to them is OK for the most part. But the few people who want to act in a way that the government does not agree with will be persecuted.\nMy parents have been [Christian] missionaries for about 18 years now, and being a missionary is outlawed in China. Our phones were getting tapped, our computer was getting hacked. My parents’ names were on the Chinese police blacklist. People like my parents are called terrorists or Tibetan freedom fighters.\nIn China, there’s very strict capital controls. So when I read about bitcoin, it was like, “This is a great way to store money with real censorship resistance.”\nQ: How did you guys live under such constant surveillance?\nWe had very specific protocols for operational security. For example, when we’re talking over the phone or email, we switch out all sensitive words and make sure our servers are not located in China.\nMy parents once had their WePay and AliPay accounts cut off. But luckily they had cash, fiat currency and physical cash so they could live. If China had been 100 percent digital, there would have been no way for them to survive.\nQ: How does your family use (relatively) decentralized blockchain technology today?\nI don’t send my parents money in crypto. But my biggest fear growing up was that my parents would be deported. In China, after they tell you that you need to leave the country, you need to liquidate all your assets in 48 hours. We used to practice this thing where we’d pack everything we have in less than 48 hours. It was kind of like our drill.\nRight now, all my parents’ assets are in crypto. As long as there’s one of us, somewhere in the world with access to our private key, our wealth is OK. It’s still very difficult for my parents to access their crypto, though. They can’t do it by themselves. They definitely need my help. That’s why I hold most of their stuff. In that way, accessibility [with crypto] is still lacking, even if it provides a store of value. And my parents don’t really understand crypto the way they understand banking services.\nAt the end of the day, censorship resistance is not enough. We need a private way of transacting and a way to make it accessible, understandable to everyone. We’re not there yet.\nChina surveillance image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "The Seoul Metropolitan Government will establish its first blockchain-based administrative services in November, according to a report in the Korean-language blockinpress.\nAt a conference held last month and attended by city officials and representatives of the private sector, specifics of the roll out were discussed, with timelines and goals established. The meeting seemed to revive an initiative that had lost some momentum since first being announced late last year.\nThree priorities were set for completion by the November deadline. The city's blockchain points system will be introduced and residents of Seoul will receive S-coins for the use of public services. They will be able to redeem those points for rewards. Services that generate the coins include paying taxes and participating in public opinion polls.\nSeoul's point system will integrated with ZeroPay, a city-government sponsored QR-code-enabled network established last December. It allows customers to pay for goods and services using their phones and does not charge merchants commissions.\nIn addition to the S-coin, a blockchain service for submitting qualifications without paper documents is also on the list for completion by November, as is the enhancing of the Seoul Citizens Card with blockchain to enable digital authentication for the use of public services.\nBy the end of the year Seoul would like to have its part-time workers rights program up and running. The blockchain-based system will allow part-time and temporary employees to sign simple contracts with employers, keep track of their work histories, and maintain time sheets. It will also help them properly register for the county's four major social insurance programs. The aim is to improve trust and relations between small companies and part-time workers.\nOther programs mentioned but not with year-end completion deadlines include smart healthcare, donation management and online certificate verification.\nWhile the blockchain services will be controlled by the city, they will be operated by private enterprises.\nSeoul has been discussing the implementation of a blockchain strategy for some time. Mayor Park Won-soon has campaigned on a promise to implement relevant solutions for the city, and the Blockchain City Seoul Promotion Plan was announced last October.\nWhen it was introduced, 14 blockchain administrative projects and a 2022 completion date were mentioned. A total of 127.3 billion won ($105 million) was to be committed to the plan.\nSince then, very little has happened in terms of actual progress. The July meeting was the first tangible sign that anything material is in the works.\nImage via Shutterstock.",

As a result, end users can't verify whether the replacement part \"was produced using a correct build file, using correct manufacturing media, and on a properly configured additive manufacturing device.\"\nGE states in the filing:\nThe move is just the latest sign of interest in blockchain technology by the industrial behemoth. Last year, the USPTO released five patent applications, all filed in 2016, which each described a different blockchain application to aid in the streamlining of aircraft maintenance.\nGE also announced in March that it had joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a blockchain consortium that aims to develop standards around the tech's use in the cargo transport industry.\n3D printer image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "The burgeoning autonomous community of Catalonia has been struggling for political freedom from Spain for years. Now, according to Jordi Puigneró, Minister of Digital Policies and Public Administration, Catalonia is also angling for digital independence.\n\"Just as the Internet brought us universal connectivity, blockchain will bring us new universal governance. It will affect the administration [of government], will affect the economy, and it will affect one thing which is very important in our society: trust,” he said. “Trust is what moves economic transactions and it’s what moves the relationship between the citizens and their government.”\nPuigneró said blockchain tech provides an opportunity for Catalonia to establish a model of self-sovereign identity.\n“That’s actually one of the projects we’re launching in Catalonia, which is to have a self-sovereign and digital identity because we believe that it is very important that the monopoly of identity is not exclusive to the state,” he said. “We want to give power to the citizens or empower the citizens in a way in which they can handle better the privacy of their data. It's also good for them to prevent the Big Brother concept. We don't want our citizens to feel like they're living in Big Brother State.”\nThe next goal is to make Catalonia a high-tech hub. He says he’s just getting started.\n“Obviously, we're not an independent state, so we are limited by some of the things which we would like to have, the tools to be able to provide,\" he said. \"We are working together with the technological centers and the universities trying to change our education system in order that in 10 years time, our citizens are more competent in terms of technical skills. We have help in attracting, curating and retaining the talent in Catalonia.”",

That came alongside five other business relationships added in recent weeks, including bitcoin security firm Casa, crypto finance protocol Compound, trading platform Crypto.com, decentralized Ethereum exchange IDEX, and bitcoin rewards platform Lolli.\nWith reporting taxes on cryptocurrency transactions notoriously complex even for experts, the firm aims to simplify that process within its tax calculator tool that automatically outputs reports for users.\nCoinTracker also has an existing integration with TurboTax, the tax-filing software offered by Intuit Consumer Tax Group, both of which partnered with prominent crypto exchange Coinbase in 2019.\nTalking of the new partnerships, Chandan Lodha, co-founder at CoinTracker, told CoinDesk \"the breadth of integrations means we can serve more crypto users and more types of crypto users from hobbyist dipping their toes into crypto via bitcoin rewards like Lolli all the way to advanced traders.\"\nAlso read: Crypto Holders Still Face Issues Reporting Tax Liabilities, Survey of CPAs Finds\nWith over $600 million in capital losses claimed on behalf of their users, the new partnerships were providing solutions for many different types of clients, he added.\nThe company also says it recently passed what it considers to be the major milestone of more than 100,000 active users, with more than 175,000 connected wallets and exchanges, as well as $20 billion in transaction volume tracked so far.\nUltimately, CoinTracker says, by helping people report their taxes with simple tools, those in the mainstream who view crypto as a tool used for illicit activity will start to understand it's a legitimate means of value transfer among law-abiding citizens.\n\"As more users and regulators see that the vast majority of cryptocurrency use is by everyday people for completely legal transactions and people are crypto tax-compliant, this only helps increase faith and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,\" Lodha said.\n\"Our hope is to show people that cryptocurrency is actually regulated and you can be tax compliant pretty easily,\" Lodha added.\nSee also: Australian Tax Office to Warn Investors Over Crypto Misreporting\nOn March 21, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin announced the usual tax return deadline of April 15 has been extended to July 15, allowing taxpayers and businesses additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties during the economic turmoil prompted by the coronavirus outbreak.",

    "title": "Sony’s Car Points to a Future of Machine-to-Machine Crypto Payments",
    "summary": "Could Sony's sensor-laden car be the future of blockchain-based mobility?",
    "content": "Sony announced a car – a real, physical vehicle with wheels and seats – at CES 2020 and everyone is losing their minds. Obviously, this car, called the Vision-S, is a prototype and you probably won't be going down to Best Buy to pick up some USB-C cables and a new Sony whip. But the simple fact remains that an electronics and software company is moving into real-world mobility.\nThis is good for crypto.\n\"This prototype embodies our contribution to the future of mobility and contains a variety of Sony's technologies,\" said Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. In other words, Sony wants a seat at the mobility table. In fact, since it launched this vehicle first it could be a major player. But the fact that it released this model at CES and in 2020 before anyone else will set a trend that will force other players to reveal their work.\nWhy should we car(e)?\nThere is a school of thought that believes the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain happens when robots begin paying robots. These robots might be cleaning our houses, taking care of our elders or driving us around. Cryptocurrency becomes the value transfer medium in this scenario and all of the sensors, computers and systems associated with washing our floors or getting us around connect to the worldwide internet of value and, in the end, supplant most payment methods.\nCar manufacturers probably won't play ball. Car sales and car manufacturers depend on a few things, the primary one being that a human will buy an expensive hunk of steel and spend quite a while behind the wheel. Sony and Apple and Intel and countless mobility startups aren't harnessed to that antiquated notion. To them, cars are computers. The Sony car is packed with sensors – lidar, radar and cameras – and 360-degree audio with a huge, wraparound screen to entertain the driver. It is, in short, the beginning of a car-creation model that pulls the industry out of the 1900s and into the 2000s.\nThe electric vehicle is built on Sony's own platform, which it plans to use in multiple body configurations. It has a reported zero-to-60-mph time of 4.8 seconds, according to Car and Driver, and a max speed of 149 mph. It's a real car with real power.\nWe know very little about Sony's future car plans and the concept model is far from ready for the market. But eventually, this car and many like it will be communicating with each other wirelessly and negotiating traffic automatically. Your wallet will take a hit if you want to get somewhere faster  —  your car will pay another car to get ahead of them  —  and you'll spend or even earn if you can spare a few more minutes on the road. Roads themselves will request tolls for maintenance and, as we sit in relative comfort, we'll be making requests for applications, educational materials and entertainment. And, if Facebook, Apple and Amazon have their way, we won't be swiping a credit card.\nAll of this assumes Sony and Apple and Google and Amazon are all thinking the same thing. Thus far, it seems they are. They are computing companies. Computing is built on open standards, and anything traditional car manufacturers do to prevent that openness will earn them a spot outside of the network. The new driverless, self-negotiating cars will also face driver resistance. Maybe we'll have a future where petulant car lovers boast they are both \"rolling coal\" and \"rolling meat\" by driving their antiquated vehicles manufactured before, say, 2025. But anything that stands in front of the onslaught of driverless, constantly negotiating vehicles will be run over.\nIn the end, maybe this Sony car is a random pop on the future's horizon. Or maybe it's something else: the beginning of a firework show that will truly take this extremely nascent technology mainstream. All we can say right now is people are excited about what's to come.",

    "content": "Payments giant Mastercard suffered a severe outage last week that led to a hold-up in transactions.\nAs reported on July 12 by the Financial Times, it had a global impact, sparking a round of complaints from the payment firm's customer base.\nAs might be expected, those affected quickly took to social media to voice their frustration with the credit card giant, which eventually was able to resolve the situation and resume service for its customers.\nIn most cases, that would have been the end of the story. This time, however, Crypto Twitter took notice, and that made all the difference for what was likely a hectic day for the credit card giant's press team.\nIn fact, the company's Twitter threads soon filled up with comments from cryptocurrency supporters and enthusiasts, who were all too eager to point out the perceived benefits of their preferred payments rail.\nWhat could be considered an inevitable question was eventually posed: why isn't Mastercard using bitcoin?\nTo be sure, the payments firm has very publicly moved to explore and test applications of blockchain, even going so far as trying to hire more developers to work on the tech. And as CoinDesk has reported, Mastercard is seeking a number of patents around cryptocurrency use (including one it won this week) – a suggestion, if anything, that the idea is on its radar.\nBut even still, critics of the company argued amid the outage that Mastercard will face a \"huge rival\" from either bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.\nSupporters of specific cryptocurrencies also came out to heckle the payments giant, including supporters of XRP and the technology developed by distributed ledger startup Ripple, and those backing the cryptocurrency Dash (formerly known as darkcoin).\nBut would the utilization of blockchain or cryptocurrency have prevented the situation Mastercard found itself in?\nJournalist David Cox tackled the question in an article for PaymentsSource, arguing that existing blockchain tech would likely be infeasible for Mastercard's present needs.\nWhether the technology as applied to Mastercard could have helped is perhaps an open question, but nonetheless, the situation was an opportunity for the crypto faithful to throw a little shade the company's way.\nImage via Shutterstock",

The same Walmart team drafted both applications, which were initially submitted on October 13 of last year.\nWhile neither filing explicitly references using a permissioned blockchain (which allows only certain parties to operate nodes), the system as described would effectively operate as such. Both applications specify that customers must be able to see their payment histories – but that third-parties need to be restricted from this degree of access.\nThe first patent filing, which describes a vendor payment system, proposes creating a network that's able to automatically conduct transactions on a customer's behalf. The payments would be received by one or more vendors – depending on what services are provided and who provided these services – according to the document.\nThe application continues:\nThe second application focuses on digital shopping systems and describes using a blockchain to encrypt payment information in a similar fashion.\nAs the filing notes, one part of \"the vendor payment sharing system also includes an authentication system for valuable digitized items ... In an exemplary embodiment, the authentication system utilizes one or more aspects of conventional [blockchain systems].\"\nThe twin applications are the latest intellectual property play from Walmart. As CoinDesk previously reported, the company is seeking a patent for a \"smart package\" that would use blockchain as a way to encode information.\nBeyond that, Walmart is also pursuing applications of blockchain for supply chain purposes, particularly for tracking shipments of food.\nImage Credit: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com",

Without this dedication from the outset, the trajectory of a technology’s development can, and often does, carry significant and far-reaching consequences.\nAs blockchain pursuits move from buzzword to business case, the technology is fast approaching an inflection point. With $12.4 billion in projected spending by 2022 and high-profile announcements from actors like Facebook, central banks and global mining and metals companies, the decisions made by builders today will have ripple effects on significant swaths of the population for years to come.\nIn fact, blockchain has already experienced the consequences of not designing with the rights of users in mind.\nIn 2017 and 2018, the sudden rise and subsequent fall of initial coin offerings (ICO) provided a case study of what can go wrong with instances of fraud, unsustainable business models and significant losses to non-savvy consumers. For example, one 2018 study identified more than 80 percent of ICOs conducted in 2017 as scams.\nThis potential for misuse caught the attention of legislators and policymakers, but in many instances it was too late. If blockchain is truly looking to scale in its next phase, repeating these mistakes is not an option.\nWhat’s at stake?\nThis new wave of development offers an opportunity to correct course. However, if organizations in a rush to act first don’t learn from the past, the technology faces several existential threats:\nRisks to users. The world has learned the hard way that bottom-line protections for users need to be considered at the outset of product design, especially when it comes to data. Blockchain’s properties as a foundational technology make these considerations particularly important, given the harm and follow-on effects that can come from potential breaches.\nPotential for transformational change can be undermined. Those with sophisticated knowledge may have the opportunity to exploit their advantages – whether to intentionally harm consumers or to suppress the market through anti-competitive actions. This behavior weakens the very premise of decentralization, which was initiated to provide censorship-resistance, privacy and a level playing field for entrants.\nWidening existing gaps. Transformation is most likely to happen in places that can leapfrog, like high-growth economies. Despite talk of the potential for financial inclusion, if not designed carefully, blockchain can lead to the further exclusion and exploitation of vulnerable populations.\nWhat can be done?\nAs with any technology, the ultimate promises and perils of blockchain technology will come down to individual decisions made across its strategy, development and implementation. It’s impossible to control all these design choices but there is still room for alignment among key players on what the minimum standards for the technology should be.\nThat’s why the World Economic Forum’s Global Blockchain Councilhttps://www.weforum.org/centre-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/global_councils is creating a “Blockchain Bill of Rights: Design Principles for a Decentralized Future.”\nThe document has been co-designed by some of the foremost leaders in the space.\nThe goal is to align private-sector leaders, policymakers and consumers in a fundamental vision of how users can and should be protected as blockchain technology develops, particularly around the following pillars:\nActing now, we hope to enable citizens, policymakers and technology users to leverage these principles as they seek to bring greater accountability to the systems that power our societies.\nAn initial draft of the Blockchain Bill of Rights will be tested at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, from Jan. 21-24, 2020. Over the course of the year, the Council will solicit input into the document via roundtables and interviews.",

    "content": "UPDATE (22, August 22:45 UTC): MouseBelt does not have any official connection with Oxford, Cambridge, or Harvard Universities as a previous version of this story indicated.\n---------\nA VC-backed blockchain firm claiming to work with student-led blockchain clubs at Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge is officially rolling out its programs at three California universities.\nMouseBelt\n's Blockchain Accelerator launched Wednesday at UC Davis, UC Los Angeles and UC Santa Barabara, boosting the educational presence at the noted U.S. schools. Backed by over $40 million in funding from NueValue Capital, MouseBelt currently aids 65 student blockchain community groups at 14 universities worldwide.\nThe accelerator joins MouseBelt's advisory team and media groups Bitcoin Radio and MouseBelt University.\nBundled into two programs, MouseBelt will sponsor undergraduate to PhD level programs. The first fund will cover research across all three campuses, specifically for blockchain project development. MouseBelt has set aside $500,000 in funding with up to five projects jockeying for $100,000 in seed funding.\nMouseBelt is also donating to the three universities engineering departments. The accelerator is hoping to co-op the donations for the development of a general fundraiser toward university selected research capped at $500,000.\nSpeaking with CoinDesk, university outreach director Ashlie Meredith said the program is designed to fill a knowledge gap in the university level system. Most universities do not hold blockchain classes, leaving student organizations to fill the void.\nA little over a year ago, these same student organizations became the basis for MouseBelt's current initiative.\nMeredith said:\nWhat's in it for MouseBelt? Meredith says it's not only about equity holds in successful projects, but a long term play on student development.\nBlockchain courses in demand\nDr Mohammad Sadoghi, head of ExpoLab at UC Davis, who has been working with MouseBelt for the past year in various functions, says student demand for blockchain coursework is high. Sadoghi told CoinDesk his engineering blockchain classes max out at 65 students, forcing him to add a waitlist and cut students.\n“What would it look like if a computation is democratic and decentralized?\" Sadoghi asked in a conversation with CoinDesk. To him, blockchain technology is a paradigm shift in data storage and one requiring youthful creativity.\nRunning his own separate program at UC Davis, Sadoghi says undergraduates are currently forgotten in the space. Often, however, they hold the motivation and energy but merely lack the opportunity.\nCalifornia flag via CoinDesk archives",

    "summary": "Now in its second year, the New York State Senate's Internet and Tech Committee has approved two blockchain bills, which now go to the full Senate for a vote.",
    "content": "ALBANY, N.Y. — The New York State Senate will be considering two bills that would bolster the use and development of blockchain tech in the Empire State.\nThe first bill, S4142, would recognize blockchain-based records and contracts as electronic signatures under state law, giving them legal clout. The second, S6037A, would add “distributed ledger technology” developers to the Excelsior Jobs Program, which comes with tax credits.\nIntroduced by Senator Diane Savino (D-23) and approved by the Internet and Technology Committee, which she chairs, after a hearing Tuesday, the bills next go to the full Senate for a vote. If passed, the measures will move to the New York State Assembly for consideration.\n“The use cases are tremendous,” said Adriana Babino, a cybersecurity expert and resident technical adviser on Savino’s Internet and Technology committee. “By embracing the blockchain tech and the digitized ledger, you're opening up the state to many possibilities.”\nShe said these bills specifically will add secure protections to residents’ use of digital transactions and create employment opportunities.\nThe bills have been tried in the state legislature before, according to Barbara O’Neill, senior adviser to Savino.\nBoth bills were introduced, in various iterations, during the 2017-2018 legislative session, part of the early efforts by Savino’s committee to bring more high-tech legislative initiatives to the state government.\nThat committee is now entering its second year, having formed shortly after Democrats took control of the state Senate for the first time in half a century. The 2019 committee launch helped the Senate streamline all forms of internet-related legislative actions, including those related to blockchain.\nThe New York State Assembly has no full committee for internet and technology although it does have a subcommittee, chaired by blockchain proponent Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D-33), which must refer all approved legislation to another committee. Small bureaucratic distinctions add hurdles to any legislative action, slowing down or even stifling the passage of lower-priority bills, according to O’Neill.\n“Coming from a subcommittee process it’s a little bit more awkward. Their stuff kind of ends up all over the place,” O’Neill said. She said the Senate committee is hopeful that at some point soon the Assembly will elevate Vanel’s committee to full status.\nEven so, Babino, the technical adviser, said Albany is coming around to the concept of blockchain. Last year, staffers and senators asked basic questions about blockchain and distributed ledger technology, prompting Babino to develop an explainer presentation. But this year many appear more comfortable with the technology, which helps them see the value of the legislation, she said.",

    "summary": "Vermont state regulators will begin recording the production of hemp – a low-THC cannabis strain popular in textiles – on the ethereum mainnet this year.",
    "content": "Vermont regulators will track hemp production on the ethereum mainnet in partnership with cannabis supply chain blockchain startup Trace.\nThe five-year deal, announced Monday by Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (VAAFM), is a production-ready solution for every level of the hemp trade, said Trace CEO Josh Decatur. Beginning in March, farmers and processors will begin putting all associated crop data into the Trace system, which runs on ethereum.\nIt is one of the first times a state regulatory agency has decided to run with the ethereum mainnet, Decatur told CoinDesk in a phone call. The two-year-old company, based in Vermont's capital Montpelier, has built an app users can share details through, and gas fees for conducting transactions are passed onto the users – in this case, the state government.\n“Everyone is deriving value from innate blockchain tech – namely the security that comes with public permissionless blockchain technology,” he said.\nVermont’s regulators said this is the first full-scale government registration and licensing system that pairs blockchain with the nascent hemp industry. Hemp was legalized nationally in the 2018 Farm Bill, but Vermont’s program runs under the 2014 edition.\nA cannabis strain used in the textiles industry, hemp represents a small but growing slice of Vermont’s agriculture sector. The Green Mountain State had just 1,000 registered hemp farmers in 2019 with nearly 9,000 acres of farmland, as well as 300 processors, according Stephanie Smith, VAAFM’s Hemp Program manager.\n“It’s important to understand what’s being grown, where it's being grown and where it’s going after being harvested,” she said.\nThe mini-boom foreshadowed VAAFM’s call for a hemp registration system. Trace, whose CEO has roots in the Northern California grow scene, beat out the competition. Being based in Vermont didn't hurt either.\n“We spent the last couple of years finding innovative ways to hone a product that could meet the tracking and data requirements of a state agency,” Decatur said.\nHis Vermont-based team had been building “seed-to-shelf” tools for other sectors of the cannabis supply chain, such as cannabidiol (CBD) products. The company built patented software, an app and a web portal to document where, when and to whom a plant and its derivative products move.\nTrace’s solution relies on the ethereum network. At 15 transactions per second, the network is hardly a salve for industrial users moving massive amounts of data. But that doesn’t matter for the low-frequency hemp lot farmers who, Decatur said, only send three to four transactions per year.\n“The use case that we’ve applied the tech to fits into the performance restrictions of ethereum,” he said.\nTrace’s registration system should be live by the end of March, according to Smith, in time for the start of the outdoor growing season in June.",

However, tokens which are not marketed as investments and which the purchaser can utilize or redeem within 90 days, according to the bill, would sit outside that definition.\nThe second bill\namends the Arizona Revised Statutes to account for data that is written and stored on a blockchain. In a way, the bill bears a relation to a past Weninger bill which legally recognized blockchain signatures and smart contracts, a measure that was signed into law last year.\nStepping back, the state government has made several steps in recent weeks to broaden the adoption of the tech within the state.

    "summary": "Blockchains CEO Jeffrey Berns hopes the bank will fund not only his vision, but the blockchain industry's.",
    "content": "Jeffrey Berns, eccentric founder of blockchain incubation and investment firm Blockchains.com, purchased a small community bank in Las Vegas, Nevada in order to secure financing as he manifests his decentralized dreams, according to The Nevada Independent.\nBerns said his ambitions are incompatible with the current financial system and he feared that the banking complex would cut off his supply of capital. The 56-year-old attorney previously announced plans to construct a Reno-sized, blockchain-focused smart city and e-sports arena in the Nevada desert.\nHis $28 million acquisition of the Kirkwood Bank of Nevada “is a small but critical step in helping the nascent company achieve its wildly ambitious goals,” reported The Nevada Independent. In addition to financing his own projects, Berns hopes Kirkwood Bank of Nevada will become a leading bank for the blockchain industry.\n“It’s to create an environment where the blockchain ecosystem, the legitimate businesses out there who are trying to build projects that are going to empower the individual and better the world… have a bank that understands what they’re doing and isn’t fearful,” he said.\n“Banks are hesitant, because if this takes off, you don’t need banks anymore. They become obsolete,” Berns said.\nBerns purchased the bank through a separate holding company to mitigate the reporting and ownership responsibilities. Additionally, he said he planned to decentralize his companies in the future, turning power over to users of the system.\n“I don’t think the regulators would have ever been comfortable with that,” he said, adding he may attempt limited integration of Blockchains with the bank to create a sandbox to test his financial technology and blockchain ideas.\n“I needed a playground,” he said. “I needed a place to do proof-of-concept with regulators to show that loans can be done in such a way that if I have $1,000, I could invest 10 cents in 10,000 loans and, it would all be done on the blockchain and micro payments would be made, and there’s no funny business.”\nBerns’ negotiation with Kirkwood began in February 2018, after he spent a year searching for a banking partner. He paid $25 million for the entity, and invested an additional $3 million.\nAccording to the FDIC the bank has more than $86.6 million in assets and has had a 9.14 percent return on equity in 2019. It has never changed ownership since its founding in 2008.\nBank President John Dru said were no immediate planned changes for banking operations except for the name and a branch opening in Northern Nevada. It is unconfirmed what the bank's new name will be.\n“I know for sure that the customers won’t see any changes,” Dru said. “All executive management is staying on board. The directors, there’s no change there, they’re all going to stay on. And even the account numbers won’t change.”\nBerns also said he plans to buy or create a 3D printing company to print a portion of his blockchain city. He’s considering using an undervalued building material – hemp – during the process and may cultivate the resource on 67,000 acres of land owned by Blockchains.\n“It’s environmentally friendly, it sucks carbon out of the air, it rehabilitates soil and it’s all around an amazing product,” Berns said. “And we had planned to do it on a smaller scale and after hemp was legalized, we intend to go much bigger.”\nBlockchains recently partnered with slock.it to further its integration within the Internet of Things.\nPhoto by Robbie Noble on Unsplash",

All 25 million tokens were sold at a market drive price of $2.40.\nCompany representatives told CoinDesk, the \"cryptocurrency auction was the first implementation of its transparent, innovative economic model,\" which stresses fairness and inclusivity in an attempt to build a \"Borderless Economy.\"\nAlgorand is where “macroeconomics meets cryptocurrency,\" writes Ninos Mansor of Arrington XRP Capital, in his paper \"The Monetary Experiment: Algorand A Thesis For Algo Currency Markets,\" published June 17.\nThe auction coincided with the official launch of Algorand's MainNet. The platform handles 1,000 transactions per second with a latency of less than 5 seconds, putting it on par with the throughput of major global payment networks -- such as Visa or Mastercard.\nAdditionally, as a permissionless, pure proof-of-stake blockchain Algorand offers the “bleeding edge cryptography with a clever economic model,” said Arrington.\nThis is the first time Algos entered market circulation.

    "summary": "Everledger, known for tracking diamonds on the blockchain, says the supply chain for batteries is where it will focus next.",
    "content": "Pioneering blockchain startup Everledger, famous for digitally recording the lifecycle of diamonds, is now tracking rare earth minerals including cobalt and lithium, the two essential raw materials used in batteries.\nTo help push this work forward, Everledger plans to collaborate with Circulor, which has made its name using blockchain technology to monitor the sustainability of supply chains.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nBoth companies inhabit the environmental, social and governance (ESG) space, fast becoming one of the hottest propositions within the enterprise blockchain sector, as evidenced by this year’s Hyperledger Global Forum in Phoenix, Ariz.\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, Everledger founder and CEO Leanne Kemp said a collaboration with Circulor was in progress.\n“An early-stage collective collaboration is underway,” said Kemp. “So you will probably see something in April around that work.”\nCirculor’s first trial involved tracking tantalum, a conflict mineral out of mines in Rwanda. Since then the startup has started working with Volvo to trace cobalt for electric batteries and Daimler for tracking CO2 in the supply chain.\nCirculor CEO Doug Johnson-Poensgen confirmed the talks with Everledger.\n“The emerging market for traceability is large,” he said. “We expect that the cooperation that exists between large IT companies now will apply to the upstarts who have meaningful traction like Everledger and ourselves. It all comes down to effective ways of serving the needs of our customers.”\nExploring the ethical and sustainable use case together makes sense because Everledger and Circulor are both built using the same open-source technology called Hyperledger Fabric, an enterprise blockchain heavily backed by IBM.\nDouble bottom line\nEverledger was one of the first companies to show that blockchains can have uses outside of cryptocurrency, creating an immutable digital record of diamonds starting in early 2015. The firm has since built an impressive network of partnerships that cover some 40 percent of all diamonds in circulation.\nAs well as being first to market, Everledger combines what CEO Kemp calls “value and values,” using blockchain to verify not only that a diamond didn’t come from a factory but also that it didn’t come out of slave labor.\n“We saw that the next most potentially conflicted supply chain is going to be in rare earths and batteries,” said Kemp.\nUnderscoring the importance of the ESG component in this choice, Kemp added: “We’re not interested in tracking lettuce. That’s not where the world needs us to be.”\nJohnson-Poensgen anticipates a broad range of use cases opening for Circulor. For instance, it’s not just cobalt mined in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo that is a problem in making batteries, he said: Lithium extraction threatens to cause an environmental catastrophe in South America’s Atacama desert by polluting water sources.\nOther exciting areas include chemical recycling of plastics, or creating a circular economy for cotton, much of which is picked using forced labor in places like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan before it even gets to the sweatshops in Bangladesh, said Johnson-Poensgen.\n“Every one of these raw materials comes with significant ESG concerns in different parts of the world. Complex industrial supply chains face significant challenges and that’s what we’re interested in,” he said.\nEnter IBM\nAs well as having chats with Everledger, Johnson-Poensgen says Circulor has also been talking about interoperability with IBM.\nUnlike a small and nimble startup, IBM has taken a heavyweight consortium approach to sustainable supply chain tracking. Back in April 2019, IBM launched the Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN), which is currently focused on cobalt for batteries and includes the likes of Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen Group, LG Chem and Huayou Cobalt.\n“The challenge with the consortium is it slows you down because doing things by committee is not the most efficient way to go,” said Johnson-Poensgen. “I want to provide customers with coalition benefits without consortium constraints. So Daimler pays for all the work around CO2, which will benefit Volvo, without formally having got into bed together.”\nSai Yadati, a partner at IBM Global Business Services, said Big Blue has refined its blockchain governance model to collaborate at speed and is on track for a production release in June of this year.\nYadat said IBM was open to explore interoperability with other Hyperledger projects.\n“Industrywide collaboration is certainly our goal,” he said. “We're collaborating with other networks that share common goals, and interoperability is an important part of our 2020 roadmap.”",

    "title": "Can Bitcoin Survive the Climate Change Revolution?",
    "summary": "If ESG is becoming the new buzzword among impact-minded financial institutions, where does energy-intensive bitcoin fit in?",
    "content": "Coronavirus might be the biggest story of the decade, but climate change will be the grand narrative of the century.\nAs energy of any kind becomes of premium value to the planet, and the world’s transport systems come onto the electric grid, how will notoriously energy-hungry processes like bitcoin fare?\nIn financial services, environmental, social and governance (ESG) is becoming the new buzzword among impact-minded corporations. An example of this was the latest letter from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink promising a fundamental reshaping of finance.\nBitcoin, although it’s also about fundamentally reshaping finance, has earned a bad reputation when it comes to energy use, thanks to the vast number of specially-designed computers needed to carry out its mining process.\nRead more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming\nHow you choose to interpret bitcoin’s energy consumption depends on your perspective. Bitcoin supporters might point out that PlayStation, for instance, uses up about as much power as the Bitcoin network, according to research by Bitwise Asset Management. The reinvention of money, they’ll add, is a much loftier goal than playing FIFA 20.\nOn the other hand, the Greta Thunberg generation may question what appears to be just another financial trading instrument – but one that consumes as much electricity as Chile, a country with 18 million people.\nThe recent meltdown in markets caused by coronavirus raises other questions about bitcoin’s place in the world. Bitcoin, sometimes described as “digital gold,” was always seen as a safe haven for investors, un-correlated as it was with the rest of the financial system. But the coronavirus shock saw bitcoin fall even more precipitously than the stock market. Its recent ebbs and flows have mirrored that of the S&P 500.\nAs economist and author Frances Coppola puts it: “If bitcoin can no longer be used as digital gold, what can it be used for?”\nWall Street’s cold feet\nSome would argue the gradual encroachment of institutional money into bitcoin as a high-yielding alternative asset class comes with its own cost: a newfound correlation with the rest of the financial system.\nIndeed, there has been an assumption from some quarters of the crypto world that it’s only a matter of time until swathes of institutional investment will flow into bitcoin. This will follow as the network becomes more regulated, they say, and things like dedicated exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerge.\nBut with a firm focus on ESG among institutional investors of any real size, that may not happen after all, at least not at anything like the scale once predicted.\n“I think bitcoiners are very much hoping in the future that institutional investors will put their money in bitcoin,” said Alex de Vries, blockchain specialist at PwC. “But it's very unlikely that shareholders of those institutions will allow companies to invest in high-carbon assets.”\nIt’s not easy to take the temperature of large-scale buyside when it comes to crypto. When CoinDesk asked some of the largest investment firms if ESG concerns might be a factor regarding bitcoin as a hedge, most of them declined to comment.\nHowever, one of the largest retirement funds in the U.S., which asked not to be named, said simply: “Things like bitcoin don’t fit into our portfolio.”\nWithin the confines of crypto, the question of ESG in relation to bitcoin does occasionally come up but it's relatively rare, said Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management.\n“I would say it comes up in one out of every 20 serious conversations,” he said.\nHowever, Hougan conceded ESG is certainly the topic du jour, and he expects to hear it mentioned more often.\n“I fully agree that ESG has entered a sort of new era in 2020. It's the combination of Larry Fink's letter, of the Australia wildfires, the California wildfires, Greta's popularity. I do think it’s top of mind. I've overheard ESG investing conversations in coffee shops here in the U.S., which I've never done in the past,” Hougan said.\nThat said, it’s probably fair to say the bitcoin community, for the most part, is not too concerned about environmental issues.\nFor example, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of crypto-focused investment firm CoinShares, pointed out that ESG and environmental sustainability tends to come in cycles; it was a big topic 10 years ago, then it died down and now it's big again, she said.\n“Historically, ESG had sort of been a backwater of investing, where you got sent if you weren't fit for front office,” said Demirors. “It was sort of this niche hippie topic for bleeding-heart liberals and there were certain connotations with ESG that it was largely bullshit.”\nESG community\nESG warriors perhaps share some similarities with the crypto community: Both are growing and passionate movements, and both could be viewed as extremists by the mainstream financial services sector.\nAnd though some ESG fans see the value in blockchain for being able to track global supply chains, the goodwill does not extend to bitcoin itself.\nLauren Compere, director of shareowner engagement at Boston Common Management, a majority-employee-owned and woman-led investment firm with over $20 billion in assets under management, said millennials and post-millennials want to track how a particular T-shirt is made, for example, or check its provenance using a slavery app.\nRead more: Everledger Looks Beyond Blood Diamonds With ESG Supply Chain Collaboration\n“I think from an ESG perspective, they are also looking at, ‘How does something like bitcoin fit into the ecosystem?’” said Compere. “What kind of impact does it have on things like climate? Is it a contributor? Is it an enabler?”\nBrett Wayman, VP of impact investing at Envestnet, a provider of software to financial advisors, said it’s a question of deciding if the benefit of cryptocurrency as a separate asset class outweighs the negatives of the environmental impacts of Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.\n“Right now I think the environmental impact is pretty extensive. I do think that bitcoin is an interesting investment. But from an energy usage standpoint, my understanding is that it will only become more and more energy-intensive to mine some of these currencies,” said Wayman.\n(That likely doesn’t hold for cryptocurrencies based on the less-mining-intensive Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which includes the forthcoming overhaul of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap.)\nMartin Vezer, manager of thematic research at Sustainalytics, which is 40 percent owned by Morningstar, said there are clear environmental concerns when a coin relies on mining, which can be quite energy- and carbon-intensive depending on where the electricity is coming from.\n“A fundamental question for investors to consider is whether a cryptocurrency is a commodity that actually adds value. In the early trends that we see, a lot of people appear to be buying and selling cryptocurrency as a short-term bet rather than a long-term investment. Sure, this gamble has paid off for some, but others have lost money,” said Vezer.\nResponsible investors typically look for long-term opportunities with a clear value proposition rather than a short-term betting opportunity, Vezer added. “They weigh the environmental and social risks associated with an asset before adding it to their portfolio,” he said.\nRenewable reputation?\nWhile much of the data is based on estimates, it’s thought that close to 75 percent of bitcoin mining is fuelled by renewable energy.\nBitcoin miners are nomadic and will migrate to the cheapest sources of energy. Over half of all bitcoin mining takes place in China’s Sichuan province, which has excessive hydropower capacity.\nThe portability of bitcoin mining rigs allow for interesting innovations such as consuming wasted energy from oil wells. In such cases, trapped gas is vented into the atmosphere or burnt off by flare towers because it’s not deemed worthwhile to capture and transport.\nSteve Barbour, the founder of Upstream Data, which operates bitcoin mines on oil fields in Canada, has even described bitcoin mining as a “conservation machine.” The vented gas fuels a generator that the mining computers are plugged into. It’s a relatively low capital expenditure for an oil company, said Barbour, especially when presented with the prospect of future BTC returns.\nRead more: Yale Researchers Turn to Hyperledger to Track Carbon Emissions\nUpstream Data is planning bitcoin mining trials with Canadian Natural Resources, a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed oil and gas producer that reported over $21 billion in revenue last year, Barbour told CoinDesk.\n“What we are doing with bitcoin mining reduces venting of methane into the atmosphere,” he said. “It’s an example of how an ESG narrative around bitcoin is at least incomplete.”\nHowever, Martin Wainstein of the Yale Open Climate project, an advocate of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology generally, said he remains skeptical of such “green” endeavors.\n“Even though they have gotten very creative to be energy efficient at sources where you have waste, bitcoin is out of control and doesn't work the way it was designed for,” said Wainstein. “I think the climate problem will force bitcoin to self-regulate or reconfigure itself.”",

That initiative is aimed to develop guidelines and protocols for the blockchain industry, as well as to promote the EU’s blockchain standards internationally.\nEU flag image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Distributed ledger tech provider R3 says it's providing pension firms with the technology to build new blockchain-based identity solutions that could help savers reclaim some of the $48 billion in lost U.K. pension pots.\nAccording to Abbas Ali, the head of the New York firm's digital identity unit, pension providers will be releasing their own solutions that leverage the R3 tech throughout 2020.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nMore than 33 million people in the U.K. have a pension. But in a study by advice firm Profile Pensions this year, 24 percent of respondents said they had likely lost track of one of their pensions.\nEstimating that there are more than 1.6 million lost pension pots nationwide, each with an average value of £23,000, the study concluded there could be as much as £37 billion (approximately US$47.8 billion) worth of unclaimed pensions in the U.K. alone.\nThis isn't just a British problem. The Australian Tax Office estimated that $17.5 billion AUD ($11.3 billion) lay in unclaimed pension pots in 2017–2018. In 2013, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) said there was more than $58 billion in unclaimed pensions in the U.S.\nIn R3's view, the problem boils down to identity.\n\"One of the biggest and most costly exercises in pension funds is identifying the user ... and verifying each year that the user is still alive and entitled to these funds and managing the process,\" Ali said.\nMany pension providers have little option but to verify pension holders' identities by mailing documents to their last known address or even requesting holders present themselves for registration, he said.\nAs a verification system, it's full of holes. Through ill-health, commitments or distance, many people won't be able to show up at an office so easily. Some are simply no-shows. If users fail to disclose a forwarding address, the pension provider may have lost its only way of contacting them.\nPutting users in control\nBlockchain could create a whole new dynamic, Ali said.\n\"We've built digital identity platforms with a couple of partners that are global,\" he said. \"We're actually working with tech partners, the likes of Gemalto [part of the Thales Group, one of the largest identity management companies in the world], who actually are members of government-organized pension funds.\"\nIn the legacy system, people have to create identity profiles for each and every pension scheme they sign up to over the course of their working lives. By using blockchain, people could create a single identity profile, with verifiable information like passports and driving licenses, that they themselves hold and share with their pension providers, according to R3.\n\"The blockchain angle essentially gives users control over their digital identity ... instead of a third party providing a service, a blockchain network could potentially mean citizens are in control of their identity and organizations including government departments would exist on the network and users would be able to selectively disclose parts of their identity as needed,\" Ali said.\nR3's Corda blockchain has already been used to create identity management systems. Software company Persistent launched a self-sovereign identity solution on Corda that allows users to create and manage their own identities. Another company, Cordentity, offers identity management that can be integrated into enterprise blockchain Hyperledger.\nHowever, pension pot administration \"is definitely one of the use cases where we can find the most economic value,\" Ali said. It is already being used by pensions startup GROW Super, which helps Australians recover missing workplace pensions.\nThe idea is also gaining traction in government departments. In September 2019, the German government said it would launch a pilot project for a blockchain-based digital identity sometime in the future.\nWhy a blockchain?\nBut while many experts recognize the usefulness of a standardized digital identity profile, some have expressed skepticism over why it should use blockchain.\nDavid Birch, director at electronic transactions consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, said it was not \"transparently obvious\" what value blockchain really adds. A centralized database, in his opinion, would function just as well at allowing users to share their digital identities.\n\"Does it make a difference to these verifiable identities that they are stored on a distributed ledger? I don't think it does,\" Birch said.\nThe only difference is blockchain makes users responsible for maintaining their own identities, Birch said. But many would probably prefer a regulated third party to handle their profiles for them.\nThat many blockchain-based identity management systems did not have an answer for how to deal with lost private keys presented yet another danger, he added.",

    "title": "Blockchain Startups Are Modernizing Iran's Financial Infrastructure",
    "summary": "Sources in Iran say the country's financial sector is taking clear steps toward a state-backed token economy.",
    "content": "Update (Feb. 15, 20:30 UTC): This article and its headline have been updated to clarify the status of two of the projects discussed: Borna is the only project to receive government funding, and it does not currently plan to issue tokens; Kuknos does not yet have government approval for Paymon because the new legal process is still being finalized.\n---------\nThe Iranian government is engaging with blockchain startups that are laying what could be the groundwork for a new token ecosystem, CoinDesk has learned.\nMany government banks around the world have launched isolated blockchain pilots. But in January, the Central Bank of Iran unveiled plans for a more comprehensive cryptocurrency program at Tehran's Electronic Banking and Payments conference. While the new framework – which includes restrictions on accepting or sending bitcoin payments as well as supportive measures for bank-issued cryptocurrencies – is not yet approved, Iranian sources say it's in the process of becoming law.\nSources tell CoinDesk at least one such project earned the support of the central bank's technology arm, the Informatics Services Corporation (ISC). What's more, private banks in the country have stepped up to fund one of the startups in a move that could pave the way for the issuance of the first native Iranian cryptocurrency.\nOne of those initiatives is the Kuknos protocol, created by a new Tehran-based startup called Kuknos Company, which is seeking permission to issue a gold-backed token called Paymon. Another blockchain infrastructure project called Borna is being developed in a private-public partnership and is funded directly by the Central Bank of Iran.\nOne anonymous source working within the ISC told CoinDesk that startups are helping to modernize Iran's financial infrastructure.\nThe first startup, Kuknos Company, was recently founded with just under 20 employees, according to Kuknos advisor Soheil Nikzad. The company is receiving funding from private Iranian banks like Bank Mellat, Bank Melli Iran, Bank Pasargad and Parsian Bank.\nNikzad told CoinDesk the company will release Paymon, the gold-backed cryptocurrency, in a multi-stage token sale, including a private sale to banks and eventually a public securities offering akin to stocks. The Kuknos protocol will also include a system for tokenizing traditional assets like real estate, he said.\nSpeaking about the public phase of the upcoming Paymon token sale, Nikzad said:\nAt the same time Borna – the second blockchain project presented at the same conference in Tehran in January – is being developed by the startup Areatak in conjunction with the ISC.\nAreatak is a bitcoin industry incumbent that previously garnered most of its funding through the local cryptocurrency mining boom. Part of this startup is now housed inside ISC’s Tehran office, where it is developing a national system for identity verification and token management, according to the anonymous source within the organization.\nNikzad said several local projects have reached out to Kuknos seeking guidance for prospective initial coin offerings.\n“There are at least 50 blockchain startups in Iran,” Nikzad said. Speaking of the broader Iranian market he added:\nToken economy\n“The most important advantages of Borna is the know-your-customer process and compatibility with the revised Payment Service Directive implementation,” Iranian entrepreneur Amir Abbas Emami told CoinDesk.\n“Kuknos is another banking consortium blockchain using Stellar architecture for tokenization of assets such as gold, real estate, fiat currencies and other assets,” Emami said.\nIf the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran approves regulations for non-governmental entities to issue tokens, Emami’s crypto startup CarChain aims to use these systems for an initial coin offering in 2019. CarChain is very similar to the ride-sharing app Uber except it accepts token payments and would leverage distributed networks for enhanced privacy features.\nSpeaking of the new banking plans, Emami said:\nUntil then, Areatak CTO Alireza Arabi told CoinDesk that Borna is the only blockchain project officially approved by the central bank and, indeed, owned by the ISC.\n\"It [Borna] provides the main standard infrastructure to create a blockchain-based financial layer for Iran’s banking ecosystem,\" Arabi said.\nOn sanctions\nGlobal media sources have speculated about Iran seeking to leverage cryptocurrencies to bypass economic sanctions, which restrict U.S. banks and organizations from doing business with the Iranian finance sector.\nThe anonymous Iranian source with knowledge of ISC's work said bypassing sanctions would be “too suspicious” for the governmental bank. Borna, ISC’s Hyperledger-based project, is focused on modernizing and standardizing digital infrastructure across domestic business sectors like insurance and healthcare.\nPlus, any individuals involved with a project deliberately designed to evade sanctions would likely find themselves personally subject to sanctions if they traveled abroad.\nLikewise, Nikzad said that even though the private sector’s Kuknos system will be more compatible with international finance systems, its main goal is to reduce costs and friction for domestic Iranian transactions.\n“By implementing new standards, based on international standards, you are able to make systems that are ready to connect to international ones,” Nikzad said. “Even if they don’t connect abroad, at least they’ve improved Iranian payment systems and decreased costs.”\nFor now, Nikzad said Kuknos is focused on establishing strategic pilots with local mobile operators, insurance companies and other enterprise banking customers.\nMuch like the broader cryptocurrency space, the aim is to make significant portions of the Kuknos ecosystem from open source software and to also release additions on platforms like GitHub, so that any developer around the world could contribute to or integrate these Iranian systems.\nDespite the government’s stringent approach to bitcoin, the anonymous Iranian source said he was neither disappointed nor surprised.\n“I personally wouldn’t expect anything else from Iran’s central bank other than they acknowledge the technology that is changing the world,” he said, noting the government’s “conservative” approach to decentralized currencies.\nTehran image via Shutterstock",

It will be issuing 8,500 tokens for the former and 5,000 for the latter and offering the tokens during an event to be held at Lounge K in Gangnam on September 19.\nEach token will be priced at 9,900 won ($8.18).\nThe tokens will be recorded utilizing ethereum and will be tradeable privately or via a platform for exchange to be set up in Hong Kong early next year. They will not be listed on crypto exchanges as each work will have its own token.\nJun Kim, CEO of Artbloc, says that the idea is to bring high-end works to regular investors and customers. With galleries and auction houses serving the rich and with the middle class only able to buy cheaper works, he saw an opening.\n\"Artbloc will sell high-end art to the public,\" Kim said.\nHe keyed in on Hockney because the artist is extremely popular in South Korea. An exhibition was held from March through August this year at the Seoul Museum of Art. It was a popular show and well covered in the local press, so much so that Hockney is now almost a household name. His Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for $90 million in 2018, the most ever for a painting by a living artist and 5,000 times the original price.\n\"It was so hot,\" says Kim of the exhibition in Seoul. \"We can sell factional ownership to normal people.\"\nKim would not disclose the price he paid for the first two paintings he acquired, but he did say that he was in the market for more works. He is especially interested in paintings by Roy Lichtenstein.\n\"This is just the pilot,\" he says. \"It's just the first step.\"\nKim has incorporated an entity in Hong Kong—Artbloc Marketplace—but he says that the works themselves will be kept and displayed by galleries in Seoul so that the public and the fractional owners can view them. He mentioned Platform L in Gangnam and ART 247 in Itaewon as possible locations for display.\nHockney image via Christie’s.",

    "content": "Shinhan Financial Investment will soon be offering peer-to-peer (P2P) stock lending via the blockchain.\nWhen the new service is introduced this year, individuals will be able to borrow and lend securities with other individuals directly, rather than going through an intermediary. The Economic News and other local Korean media reported the news.\nSecurities lending and borrowing transactions are normally inefficient and expensive for anyone but larger investors. Commissions can be high and accurate information difficult to obtain. With a P2P service, individual owners of stock should be able to easily and cheaply lend their shares directly to others, earning a fee in the process. Individual short sellers will potentially be able to borrow stock from willing counterparties without having to pay exorbitant fees to large institutions.\nShinhan Financial Investment, which is a brokerage related to the country's second largest banking group by assets, is developing the capability in cooperation with Directional, a Korean company that has been permitted by the Financial Service Commission (FSC) to provide stock lending and borrowing as part of the government's sandbox initiative. Sandboxes, which are being aggressively pushed by the current administration, allow for a temporary lifting of regulations for the testing of innovative technologies and services.\nDirectional\nreceived its exception in May under a financial market sandbox program announced by the FSC in April. No timeframe has been reported for the roll out of the Shinhan offering.\nShinhan Bank has been aggressive in its pursuit of blockchain solutions. Two years ago, it started using the technology for the verification of gold bars. Since then, it has utilized it for interest rate swaps and and cross border remittances. In May this year, it was reported that the bank would use the technology for loan verification, enabling customers to electronically submit documents that previously had to be presented on paper, and often in person, and authenticated manually.\nLike most commercial banks in Korea, Shinhan has been more enthusiastic about blockchain than pure crypto, tracking the official government stance but running counter to customer appetite for coins.\nThe bank was for a while more positive on crypto and accepted deposits from cryptoexchanges and exchange customers rejected by other banks. But in light of increased scrutiny by the authorities from 2018, and in light of new FATF standards, the bank has upped its surveillance of crypto-connected accounts and is instituting systems and procedures to enforce real-name account requirements and adhere to Know-Your-Customer best practices.\nLike other banks, it is currently renegotiating its cryptoexchange deposit agreements. While an extension of its contract with Korbit, the local exchange it serves, is expected, nothing is guaranteed given concerns about possible fraud.\nImage via Shutterstock.",

    "summary": "The new rules for crypto businesses will be released in June 21 but many regulators are already worried about the repercussions.",
    "content": "Cryptocurrency regulation will take a step forward during the upcoming V20 Summit where country representatives will assess the new course of legal action proposed by the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\nFATF will release proposals on June 21 in hopes of setting new international standards for crypto businesses.\nLegislators support the summit, which will also bring together national blockchain associations and the world’s leading Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\nFATF standards for blockchain and cryptocurrency have set high expectations among legislators. Of special interest is its impact on long-lasting financial security issues, a subject addressed by Japanese Congressman, Naokazu Takemoto.\n“The VASP industry recognizes the importance of clear regulation in preventing financial crime and mitigating corruption,” Takemoto said.\nThe event, which will run parallel to G20 Summit on June 28 and 29 in Osaka, Japan, takes a new dimension by being held at the only country to have a legal framework for cryptocurrencies.\nThe latest examples given by Japanese regulators include measures to tighten restrictions on speculative trade and new obligations for exchanges, such as keeping a cryptocurrency protection fund.\nRegulatory Concerns\nWhile regulators agree on the need to control cryptocurrency businesses, too much regulation could backfire.\nAccording Roger Wilkins, FTAF ex-president and former secretary Australian Department of the Attorney General, a common concern is that new regulations could push the public out of controlled platforms.\n“What we are hearing from industry is that the new rules may have the opposite effect to which they were intended, effectively forcing crypto transactions off the controlled platforms, which are currently one of the best avenues we have in gaining visibility over financial crime,” Wilkins said.\nBlockchain association representatives from China, South Korea, United Kingdom, Singapore and Australia will also be present at the event to review the new standard. Prior to that, the blockchain industry will know for sure if it will face real oppression from the international body.\nIn the mean time, legislators agree in the necessity for a balance in order to adapt and take advantage of the upcoming regulations. Nonetheless, is well-known that there's no such thing as flexibility or non-compliance when it comes to following FATF recommendations.\n“As a former regulator, I recognise how important it is to identify a balanced solution that implements the recommendations of the FATF while also building the opportunity for business,” Wilkins said.",

    "content": "Bank of America may be looking into replacingsome of its existing data sharing systems with a blockchain, according to a patent application released Thursday.\nThe filing, published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), outlines a permissioned blockchain which, if implemented, would securely record and authenticate personal and business data, ensuring only authorized parties can access it. Further, the system would keep a log of everyone who accesses the data, according to the application.\nThe document proposes using such a blockchain as a way to combine existing data storage platforms into a single secure network, increasing efficiency by reducing the number of storage locations for a user's data.\nAccording to the document, which was first filed in 2016, service providers and private individuals are increasingly using the internet to share personal and business records, primarily through dedicated web portals and email attachments. However, \"there are a number of disadvantages to using this type of electronic record sharing method,\" including having to repeat the process for each company and the risk of data corruption.\nUsing a blockchain would create a more efficient system, wherein an individual can store all of their records in a single digital ledger. Businesses and service providers would be able to access these records as necessary.\nNotably, this would be a permissioned blockchain, the filing notes.

    "content": "Voatz, the blockchain-based voting app that was recently claimed by researchers to have vulnerabilities, will no longer be used in West Virginia's coming elections.\nOn Saturday, NBC News reported West Virginia's secretary of state, Mac Warner, had announced disabled and overseas voters would not, after all, be able to vote with mobile applications during the state's primaries. Instead, they will have to use a service by Democracy Live, which allows users to fill out a ballot online and return it via post.\nWest Virginia piloted Voatz's app during last year’s general midterm election, and introduced legislation early this February mandating an electronic voting option for counties across the state. NBC also said it had seen an agreement between Voatz and the state, indicating the app firm would provide its services for voting in 2020.\nHowever, it seems West Virginia's confidence in the technology was shaken by two studies from MIT and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published in mid-February that found the Voatz app and internal processes had a number of security vulnerabilities that could lead to hackers altering the ballot and revealing voter identities.\nThe DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), however, determined Voatz had \"no active threats\" on its network during the week-long operation for the U.S. midterm elections in September 2019.\nVoatz said it has since addressed recommendations provided by the DHS.\nAn election auditor who supervised Utah County’s rollout of the Voatz system told CoinDesk previously that at least some of the bugs the MIT researchers found cannot be exploited in practice.\n“If the public doesn’t want it, or is skeptical to the point they’re not confident in the results, we have to take that into consideration,” Donald Kersey, general counsel to the West Virginia secretary of state, said in NBC's report.",

    "title": "In First, Tezos Blockchain Activates Upgrade By Token Holder Voting",
    "summary": "Tezos has activated its first ever on-chain upgrade initiated entirely by Tezos bakers during a three months period of both voting and code testing.",
    "content": "The Tezos blockchain has officially been upgraded.\nIn a first for Tezos, two separate backwards-incompatible changes have been activated on the network after three months of on-chain voting by stakeholders. The Tezos self-amendment process which began for this first time back in February came to a close late Wednesday with the successful activation of an upgrade proposal, dubbed Athens A, just after 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\nProposed by a Tezos developer group called Nomadic Labs, Athens A reduces the minimum amount of tokens called rolls required for a user to become a baker on the network from 10,000 XTZ to 8,000 XTZ. Bakers are the equivalent to miners on a proof-of-work blockchain and are tasked with responsibilities such as verifying transactions and creating new blocks.\n\"The reduction will result in a bigger amount of XTZ staked,\" emphasized CMO of Everstake – a staking-as-a-service provider on Tezos – Alexandr Kerya to CoinDesk. \"Now if a baker has 16k, only 10k is staking while after the upgrade the baker will have 2 rolls engaged in staking. There will be fewer 'leftovers' so to speak which is particularly important for small bakers.\"\nAthens A additionally increases computation limits on Tezos blocks to allow for larger transaction throughput.\nSpeaking to the full process of on-chain governance that led up to today's successful upgrade activation, Arthur Breitman, the creator of Tezos, told CoinDesk:\nBreitman added that \"participation was a huge success with over 80 percent of the votes cast, twice, in a period of a few months.\"\nAgreeing with this sentiment, Awa Sun Yin, founder of the second most popular public baking service on Tezos Cryptium Labs, noted that Tezos' on-chain governance process is \"conservative,\" requiring high levels of participation and lengthy periods of repetitive voting rounds.\n\"Thus, we were concerned about voter apathy and voter fatigue,\" said Sun Yin. \"Yet, we managed to surpass quorum requirements in every phase and I am impressed by how closely the community has been relentlessly following through the entire process, actively reminding all bakers to participate.\"\nAutomatized upgrades\nTezos' on-chain governance process, while mainly for the purposes of gathering community sentiment, also automatizes the process of testing and ultimately rolling out software upgrades on the blockchain.\nRather than requiring users to manually upgrade computer servers – called nodes – in the Tezos network, the upgrade is pushed to all bakers at a specified block number.\n\"It's similar to how Constantinople happened at a given time,\" explained Jacob Arluck from the Tocqueville Group – a for-profit business development entity funded by the Tezos Foundation – to CoinDesk. \"But instead of everyone updating their software, [the upgrade] gets pushed to everyone's computers.\"\nSpeaking to what could be improved in future for Tezos' self-amendment process, Breitman added that more could be done to strengthen communication about vote proposals \"off-chain.\"\n\"Some confusion about the proposals highlighted the need for better off-chain governance rules prior to ratification of an amendment,\" Breitman told CoinDesk. \"One thing I've learned in the process is that it's more enlightening to look at the ratification of an amendment as a decentralized oracle for existing consensus than as a voting mechanism per se.\"\nAdditionally, in future, the robustness of this governance process will likely be tested as more polarizing proposals are input into the system.\nAs Andrew Paulicek, founder of HappyTezos – another public Tezos baking service – told CoinDesk:\nAthens image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Last December, Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf said 2019 was a year of “careful, prosaic BUIDLING.” Now, in an interview with CoinDesk’s Michael Casey in Davos, Switzerland, Behlendorf says a lot of what the blockchain ecosystem was building is getting closer to becoming a net positive for the world.\nCiting “double-digit” blockchain usage in the diamond trade for tracing provenance, a variety of blockchain-based digital identity projects and the rise of the central bank digital currency (CBDC), Behlendorf painted an upbeat picture of a technology moving quietly from concept phase to “in-production” deployment.\n“At this point, there have been enough pilots. There's a path here through this technology to production employment,” he said.\nBy using tools like digital identity and secure transactions, Behlendorf believes many of the biggest problems of the day can, in some ways, be improved.\n“We’re moving towards much more self-managed, self-sovereign distributed digital identity, which would not have been possible without distributed ledger technology. I know that's a big recurring theme here that we're hearing, and now you're seeing legitimization in the form of the central bank's recognizing the technology inside. So I'm feeling a tipping point,” he said.\nThe annual event in Davos, he said, is the right place to get government and business leaders to engage on such projects.\n“I worked for the World Economic Forum for two years as chief technology officer so I've been coming here for quite a while,” he said. “The forum itself was founded on these idealistic notions of making the world better.”\nThe goal, said Behlendorf, was to build consensus around pressing issues. He sees parallels to this mission in the blockchain.\n“[You get] people in a room around a table from all sorts of different sides of an issue, get them to talk about how you get out of a thorny systemic problem and come out of that room with a consensus view of how to fix things, right?” he said. “That's kind of blockchain in a nutshell.”",

    "title": "A Solution to China's Pharma Woes Might Be a Blockchain Away",
    "summary": "Could blockchain help China avoid its next vaccine scandal – or at the very least, allow for more conversation about such issues?",
    "content": "A still-evolving vaccine scandal in China prompted a range of social media discussions in the past week around how blockchain could have prevented such a situation – or how it might be used to stop it in the future.\nTo recap, ChangChun Changsheng Bio-technology, a pharmaceutical firm based in Jilin, is accused of having sold about 252,600 units of questionable DPT vaccine, not long after this Shenzhen-listed public firm was found forging data on about 113,000 substandard rabies vaccines, according to a report from the South China Morning Post.\nNotably, this is not the first vaccine-related scandal occurred in China in the past year. Several pharmaceutical companies have been involved in producing and selling a great number of DPT vaccines, and a majority of them remain unpunished to this day.\nThere's little doubt that the latest exposure of wrongdoing has caused yet another outcry among the public and the scandal-plagued pharmaceutical industry. At its heart, the snowballing problems have raised a core question: how can Chinese families protect their kids and themselves?\nThe idea that blockchain could allow for the more efficient dispersal of data about vaccines spread soon after the rabies vaccine scandal broke.\nA computer programmer under the username @wstart arguably got the ball rolling on V2EX, a Reddit-like online community. According to his post, after spending about 14 hours on data mining and coding, he was able to locate problematic vaccines in 30 provinces.\nDuring the process, he explained, it became apparent how surprisingly difficult it was to gather all the information he needed, with some still remaining unavailable or unsearchable.\nAnd that's when the crypto community in China started to come out and highlight blockchain as a possible solution.\nChaining data\nAs CoinDesk reported Monday, Xiaolai Li, one of the best-known of the country's crypto investors, was among the first to have sparked the discussion about blockchain adoption in the pharmaceutical industry.\nIn his WeChat article, the crypto investor argued that the technology could help offer visibility as medicines move through the supply chain – that is, as they transported from the facility at which they are made to the hospitals that distributed them.\nAccording to anonymous commentary which appeared on Jianshu, a blog site in China, the author said that blockchain has largely been \"demonized\" by many people because of the many token sale scandals (China banned ICOs in 2017).\nBut people should also remind themselves that blockchain itself is only a technology, the anonymous poster argued.\nAnd the idea of Chinese firms using blockchain for supply-chain purposes isn't exactly new. Companies like JD.com and Walmart are already applying the tech to tracing food shipments, for example.\nZhipeng Cheng, a financial commentator at China Finance Online, a China-based financial information company, offered a more detailed plan on how blockchain can be used in the pharmaceutical industry in an op-ed from earlier this week.\nBy using blockchain technology, he said in his article, the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) can form a public chain for its inspection technology and share its technology for vaccines tracking. Institutes and organizations can apply and participate in the public chain, he argued.\nThough just a technology, Cheng said that he believes the country should \"embrace blockchain and put it into practice.\"\nFrom ideas to practice?\nLocal news stories suggest that movement toward this is already taking place.\nBeijing News, a Beijing government-backed news outlet, reported on July 24 that several blockchain firms in China are already responding to the growing chatter about making vaccines safer and have responded by putting keywords like \"vaccines\" and \"embed vaccine on chain\" in their social media accounts.\nYet not everyone seems so enthusiastic about the concept.\nThe question \"can a mathematical algorithm really solve a trust crisis?\" was posted by a commentator on DoNews, a technology news website in China, earlier this week.\nAs they argued:\nThe author then concluded that blockchain is only a technology, which will not solve the much more complicated social issues that deeply rooted in Chinese society.\nAnother article from July 23 appeared on Zhihu, the Chinese version of Quora, also doubted the feasibility of the blockchain adoption from a more technological side.\nPeople cannot guarantee \"the authenticity of the original information,\" the author argued. \"For example, the information of the vaccine production can be false even before it gets on the chain.\"\nIndeed, at least one startup has attracted the interest from regulators regarding a claim that it is putting together a blockchain platform for this purpose, as CoinDesk previously reported.\nCensorship at work\nThe examples show that there is an earnest discussion taking place within China's social media ecosystem on this dilemma.\nBut the ever-present issue of state censorship makes it difficult to get a firm grasp on how detailed the conversations have been beyond news outlets and blog posts and the comments that accompany them.\nOn Weibo, for example, no results are shown when searching the keywords \"blockchain\" and \"vaccine\" – an indication that those posts are being masked. Yet notably, it may be blockchain itself that helps enable conversations the one taking place around the vaccine issue.\nThe original article - dubbed \"the King of Vaccine,\" which unveiled the newest scandal – is currently blocked on Chinese social media. Yet someone has permanently recorded it on the ethereum blockchain, as shown on Etherescan.\nAs this post on BTC123.com, a China-based crypto online community, explained:\nVaccination image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Members of the U.S. House of Representatives got a crash course on blockchain today, with subcommittees of the Science, Space and Technology Committee meeting to hear testimony on the tech.\nDuring the “Beyond Bitcoin: Emerging Applications for Blockchain Technology” hearing, the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology and the Subcommittee on Oversight asked a range of questions, primarily aimed at getting a sense of which use cases have attracted the most attention today – and could, in theory, wind up being used by the U.S. government itself.\nUltimately, the witnesses would recommend that Congress set up a legal framework which would encourage and, perhaps, even fund research into uses of the technology within the public sphere.\n\"I would encourage Congress to commission a blockchain advisory group,\" said Aaron Wright, an associate clinical professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and co-director of its Blockchain Project.\nHe later elaborated:\nApplications, not regulations\nThe hearing pointedly sought to avoid a topic that has been a hot one, both in and outside of Washington, D.C.: regulation. While it was a subject that came up through witness testimony, chair Ralph Abraham (R-LA) said he wanted to focus on what he described as a potentially \"transformative\" technology.\nTo that end, the hearing called for examples of how the technology can be used, both in the private sector and by the federal government.\nRepresentative Barbara Comstock (R.-VA) started listing use cases by noting that her personal information was likely stolen or compromised by a data breach at the Office of Personnel Management. As a result, she said she was “pleased” to hear about efforts to create more secure identity management platforms that uses blockchain as a means to encrypt data.\nOne notable topic of exploration came through Chris Jaikaran, a cybersecurity analyst from the Congressional Research Office, who discussed the tech's use for underpinning voting systems.\n\"The blockchain doesn’t record the vote, it records the person, the identity, the voting. The vote itself is stored on another secure system,\" he explained.\nFrank Yiannas, vice president of food safety, Walmart Inc., detailed his company's work with blockchain to the subcommittee members, explaining how the retail giant is using the tech to track food shipments.\nYiannas spoke on the pilot projects the retail giant had concluded already, explaining that blockchain has already seen success in helping track food supply chains.\nHe explained:\nSecurity concerns\nWhile committee members seemed enthused on the idea of private-sector blockchains helping businesses solve problems, they shared concerns about using similar platforms to share government-related information. Representatives Clay Higgins (R-LA) and Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) in particular asked for clarification on how distributed ledgers would be secured from potential attackers.\nCharles Romine, director of the Information Technology Lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), noted that 51 percent attacks and compromised computers could both disrupt a blockchain, but that these types of attacks would be less dangerous for large – and therefore powerful – networks.\nOne particular area that was honed in on is quantum computing, which some have warned could undermine the security of blockchain systems.\nThese concerns are being considered but are at least 15 to 30 years away from becoming a reality, Romine explained.\n\"If there is a concerted effort to develop quantum computing, I believe we have a number of years before it reaches maturity – what we refer to as being cryptographically relevant.\"\nLooking ahead\nAs with any hearing before Congress, the natural question becomes: what comes next?\nPrior to the hearing, aides to the committee downplayed the prospects of immediate action, though they floated the idea that the testimony on Wednesday could form the basis of work toward some kind of legislation around blockchain.\nIBM's Jerry Cuomo prepared a list of potential actions Congress could take in order to provide more support for blockchain research. First and foremost, he recommended that the government should encourage projects which can directly impact the U.S.\nCuomo argued in favor of a \"thoughtful\" approach to legislation.\nUltimately, it's tough to say whether Congress will move on such legislation anytime soon – especially considering the current political climate in the U.S. today – but the process likely moved one step closer through today's testimony.\nPanel image via YouTube",

Additionally, the distributed ledger prevents the possibility of there being contracts in place for which there is no record.\n“We will now be showing people the added value of this technology through applying it to something which they will use in their daily lives,” he said. “This shows how the digital transformation will affect their lives.”\nMalta – also known as “blockchain island\" – first made moves into the world of cryptocurrencies in July 2018, when they released a relaxed regulatory framework favorable to distributed ledger technologies. Electronic money, financial instruments, virtual tokens, and virtual financial assets were granted a path to legitimacy. By March of that year, Malta’s lawyers were reportedly tokenizing themselves.\nA tolerant regulatory environment, educated workforce, and E.U. membership all contribute to Malta becoming a burgeoning hub of blockchain experimentation.\nThe government will reveal the full details of the proposed rent reform in the coming days.\nBeach house image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Blockchain Startup Conflux to Get Shanghai Government Funding for Research Institute",
    "summary": "Shanghai will open a blockchain research center by the end of December with substantial investment, even as China’s government continues to crack down on crypto-related businesses.",
    "content": "A 10,000-square-meter working site, a sizable fund and an opening ceremony attended by city officials. That’s when you know the Chinese government has your back.\nHong Kong Is 'Extremely Bullish' for Crypto: p0x Labs Co-Founder\nThe Shanghai government has agreed to open a research institute with blockchain startup Conflux as early as the end of this December, while considering an incubation center that could be set up in June 2020, Fan Long, co-founder of Conflux, told CoinDesk.\nWhile declining to disclose the exact amount of funding that Conflux is set to get from the local government, Long said it will be in the millions of dollars.\nThe Shanghai Science and Technology Committee, part of the municipal government, confirmed to CoinDesk it met with Conflux on Oct. 29 to discuss government support for the institute and the incubator. An official from the committee’s technology incubation office was unable to discuss the timeline or the funding for the projects.\nThe move comes as the government continues to crack down on cryptocurrency firms that had mushroomed after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech praising blockchain. The Shanghai bureau of China’s central bank went so far as to say it would “nip young crypto businesses in the bud.” Beijing is promoting innovation, but only the kind it thinks it can control.\nNevertheless, the Conflux Incubation Center aims to invite developers and entrepreneurs to build decentralized applications (dapps) on the public permissionless blockchain developed by the firm. Like bitcoin and ethereum, that blockchain is public, so anyone can participate, and it uses a similar proof-of-work mechanism to reach consensus on the state of the ledger and to secure the network.\n“Our infrastructure for the dapps is different from ethereum and will have its own ecosystem,” said the firm’s global marketing manager, Christian Oertel, noting Conflux primarily focuses on improving its network’s scalability and building a network of global developers.\nOn top of the mandate to find venture capital firms for startups, the incubation center would develop dapps for the Shanghai government.\n“We can have dapps to help the government track funds and documents to address some of the challenges it is facing in the process,” Oertel said.\nBesides an office building in Hongqiao, one of the busiest business districts in the west of Shanghai, and the multi-million dollar funding, the city will dole out subsidies to support the research institute and incubation center, according to Oertel.\nWhile declining to reveal who initiated the partnership, Oertel said Conflux has been in talks with the Shanghai government since July.\nYoung but well-funded\nFormed in 2018, the budding company has raised $35 million from a slew of prominent investors in China, including private equity firm Sequoia China, Huobi Group, Shunwei Capital and Rong360.\n“Conflux started as a research project. We initially were just trying to find a way to scale up blockchain that could make it faster and more secure,” Long said. “When the investors got interested, we felt it might be a good idea to bring the technologies out of our laboratory.”\nThe financing round took place through a private token sale, and Conflux will launch its mainnet, or live blockchain, in the first quarter of next year, allowing developers to mine the native token CFX, Oertel said.\nOne thing Conflux stressed to CoinDesk repeatedly in the interview is it will not launch an initial coin offering (ICO) or be involved in any form of centralized token sales. Oertel said it is up to token holders to decide if they want to trade them on exchanges such as Binance, outside the Conflux network.\nConflux has 50 employees and half of the team works on the firm's technology development. The 24-person tech team includes six founding members, 12 engineers and six on the global team, across the world.\nThe firm has been looking for talent with a mix of Chinese and international education, according to the firm. Most of the current employees went to top engineering schools in China and studied abroad for their graduate degrees, according to the firm’s website.\n“Our Beijing office is close to Tsinghua University. It is convenient for us to recruit talent,” the spokesperson said.\nAt least 10 out of Conflux’ 18-member development team, including founders Fan Long and David Chow, have earned either bachelor or graduate degrees from Tsinghua University. Its research scientist Wei Xu and chief scientist Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Aaward winner, are faculty members of the university.\n“The Chinese government realizes public blockchain is important,” Long said. “They [the government] felt like it would be great if there is some team with a Chinese connection, which makes them feel more close to, so they could support building the ecosystem.”\nDecentralized public chain\n“A lot of people think doing public chain is illegal or something bad in China,” Long said. “The next level of development for blockchain will be to attract people to work on it and no one wants to work on something that they are not sure whether it is legal or not.\"\nHowever, the government realizes it is difficult to prevent the use of public and alliance blockchains, according to Long.\n“Blockchain is always associated with validated information and any validated valuable information could be digital assets whether they are on public or alliance blockchain,” Long said.. “If you have digital assets, they could be traded. The government is aware of this.”\nWhile fully embracing distributed ledger technologies and consortium blockchains, China approaches permissionless and decentralized networks in a much more cautious manner since they could be used for centralized exchanges.\nIn October, the Chinese government revealed more than 500 enterprise blockchain projects launched by state-owned banks, tech companies and government agencies, whereas few decentralized public chains have received the government’s blessing.\nYifeng Zhang, the head of Hangzhou Blockchain Technology Research Institute, said public permissioned blockchain is the best chance for the industry to commercialize the technology, during the 2019 Digital Economy Innovation Summit in October.\nOne of the few public permissionless blockchains that is closely working with the state-owned entities is Nervos’ two-layer network with an application sidechain. The firm completed its 72 million token sale and launched its mainnet in November.\nBacked by MultiCoin, Polychain Capital and Shenzhen-based China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), the firm has been working with CMBI, which is partly owned by the Chinese government, on decentralized finance applications.\nThe funding from the government is not the most important, Long said. It is the official support from the Shanghai government that makes the partnership valuable for Conflux.\nBloodbath of crypto exchanges\nSpeaking of the city’s recent crackdown on crypto exchanges, Long said the move is good in the sense that it clears out some of the illegal centralized exchanges.\nWhile it is a good thing that centralized exchanges provide liquidity for crypto assets, some of them are now hurting the reputation of the whole blockchain industry. “The majority of the bad things happening in this blockchain space have been associated directly or indirectly with centralized exchanges,” Long said.\nAs the Chinese government slowly but surely warms to decentralized public chains, it still keeps the market shut from crypto exchanges.\nIn November, megacities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen announced city-wide crackdowns on crypto exchanges and any marketing firms that promote such businesses.\nPresident Xi’s praise in October for blockchain prompted many companies to explore blockchain technologies in a bid to raise money through an ICO. As many as 25,000 blockchain companies out of 28,000 across the blockchain industry might have tried raise funding via centralized token sales, according to an official from the Beijing Blockchain Application Association.\nTo curb that development, the Chinese government has cracked down on some of the largest crypto exchanges operated within the country, including upstart exchanges BISS and Matcha.\nWhile China accused those exchanges of fraud or violating foreign exchange regulations, bigger players have pivoted to blockchain services in the country or transferred crypto businesses to other countries with more flexible regulations.\nThe Chinese branch of Huobi Group exited its crypto trading businesses from China in 2017 while expanding operations in other countries including South Korea, Japan and Turkey.\nBlockchain for all and the trade war\nBeyond Shanghai’s push to develop blockchain technologies, China has been pushing for a blockchain network that has a scale large enough to provide basic public services across the country.\nLed by the State Information Center, affiliated with China’s highest economic central planning agency the National Development and Research Commission, state-owned tech giants China Mobile, China UnionPay and China Telecom jointly announced a plan to test the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) in October.\nThe network is envisioned to be used for everything from smart city management to telecommunications. The builders hope it will become as popular among blockchain developers as the Android or IOS operating systems are among app makers.\nIn November, a 14-member consortium, including Huobi China, was formed to develop and operate the network. BSN is set to be tested in about 200 cities as well as Hong Kong and Singapore.\nThe spirit of self-made innovation comes amid the growing distrust derived from the trade war between the U.S. and China.\nSilicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator closed its China unit in November amid the tension over trade and intellectual property in the technology sector in November, although the company said the closure is not related to the trade war, according to a Reuters report.",

To that end they have added these DNA tags to TruTrace Technologies blockchain-based StrainSecure database. The company began as BLOCKStrain and is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is currently traded over the counter and it does not have a token.\nThis partnership is, as one would assume, a no-brainer. Connecting DNA tags to the blockchain is one of the interesting ways to track almost any type of consumable - from food to candy to ganja - from farm to bowl. Interestingly, the system also protects a farmer's intellectual property by ensuring genomes are traced. TheraCann is a division of molecular processing firm Applied DNA Sciences.",

Instead of signing up for a particular program, blockchain means content creators and end-users can simply reference the metadata built into images themselves.\nJPEG is a joint committee, formed from various technical standardization authorities around the world that created and now maintains the popular image format of the same name.\nAt the meeting, the group also discussed whether blockchain, and possibly smart contracts, could be used in media forensics as well as to better protect user privacy and security.\nSocial media networks, such as Facebook, could even use their proposed blockchain system to flag stolen and faked photos uploaded to their platforms, JPEG suggested.\nThe idea of using blockchain technology to verify images is not new. Photography company Kodak, as one example, licensed a third party to create a DLT-based system in early 2018 to incentivize users to report fakes and copyright violations in return for a \"KodakCoin\" cryptocurrency.\nBut JPEG's blockchain plan is still in its infancy. The group said it would continue consulting with industry figures before moving any further forward.",

    "title": "As Governments Rush to Track Coronavirus, Honduras May Offer a Privacy-First Model",
    "summary": "A blockchain startup working in Honduras may show world governments how to limit surveillance overreach while still fighting the deadly coronavirus.",
    "content": "The coronavirus crisis will certainly have lasting impacts, but some measures may prove less harmful than others.\nWhile countries like Israel and China implement coronavirus emergency measures that digitally track civilian location data and health records, an entrepreneur in Honduras developed a blockchain-powered equivalent with an acute focus on privacy.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nThe bootstrapped startup Emerge is working with the Inter-American Development Bank, the tech company Penta Network and the Emergency Response Unit of the Honduran government to launch an app this week called Civitas. This software program will associate people’s government ID numbers with unique blockchain records they can use for telemedicine and permits to leave the house on specific errands. Roughly 3.2 million people are currently living in lockdown-affected areas of Honduras.\n“It’s to better manage how people who are experiencing symptoms circulate,” said Emerge CEO Lucia Gallardo. “The last digits on your ID number determines which days you circulate.”\nJust like in Israel, Hondurans who live in lockdown areas can be fined or face criminal charges if they violate quarantine protocols, she said. In the capital city, Tegucigalpa, Gallardo said people are only allowed to leave their homes at designated times or for specific tasks. There are time slots each week, such as Monday and Wednesday from 7-9 a.m., when people in each category are allowed to shop for groceries or go out without a permit. Otherwise, civilians require a permit for outdoor errands like visiting the health care clinic.\nSo the Emerge team is rolling out Civitas this week to roughly 25,000 Hondurans, then quickly expanding to all 18 regions of the country with confirmed cases.\nIf someone feels ill, they will engage with health care specialists from the National University of Honduras to determine if the symptoms could be related to the coronavirus. People with such cases are directed to facilities that specialize in treating the virus, to reduce exposure among vulnerable populations in other hospitals.\n“The health center validates the permit that proves they were assigned to this health clinic,” Gallardo said. “Each time they go to the clinic, if they have to go more than once, is recorded and it’s all tied to the [Civitas] ID. It’s not a full history of the person’s life. It’s the history since they started the telemedicine file.”\nBlockchain features\nThe mobile app’s blockchain records serve multiple functions in a region accused by critics of having a particularly corrupt public health care system.\nThe Civitas record cannot be easily altered nor denied, at least not electronically, so censorship resistance can help establish trust in public health care options. Even if you’re poor or from a vulnerable minority, this record shows when and where the user has the right to access care. Users who don’t get care won’t go unnoticed.\nWhen doctors scan the app, they can see the symptoms and notes described via the telemedicine service, which streamlines care. The plan is to eventually include outdoor shopping schedules and other logistics as well, which is automated based on ID numbers and employment type. Most importantly, this data isn’t shared with agencies beyond the healthcare system.\n“The government doesn't view the health records, it’s a patient record for the health care provider,” Gallardo said. “Police don’t get to see your profile. [On the permit] they just see a yes or no question about whether the person is allowed to be circulating at that time.”\nIf law enforcement wants to monitor who is breaking quarantine, they need to patrol neighborhoods. This app doesn’t track location data nor keep lasting records of social graphs. There’s no social credit scores, unlike the tracking programs in China or the program NSO Group is working on in Israel. Instead, Civitas is used for emergency alerts, telemedicine, verification and other similar functions.\n“We can guarantee, probably, a phone per household but not a smartphone,” Gallardo said. “For those without [internet] connectivity, they can interact with the app via text messaging.”\nGlobal insights\nThe variety of emergency coronavirus programs raise legal questions in each jurisdiction, which offer lessons for countries still crystalizing their response plans.\nThe United Nations is relying heavily on the same Chinese technology companies known for censoring information about the coronavirus, like WeChat’s parent company Tencent, for emergency communications despite free speech concerns. However, from the perspective of eToro CEO Yoni Assia in Israel, at least surveillance programs are merely a public acknowledgement of existing government powers.\n“People are naive to think governments weren’t doing that [mass surveillance] or having that capability before,” Assia said. “The only difference here is they want people to engage with that data to keep people safe.”\nBoth Emerge and the Israeli tech company NSO Group are in talks with several governments eager to implement national tracking programs to curtail the virus.\n“It would require minimal adaptation to suit other countries, especially in emerging markets,” Gallardo said.\nUSA\nIn the United States, companies like Apple and Google are involved with developing the Trump administration’s screening program.\nGoogle, in particular, owns a staggering amount of behavioral user data. There are other companies researching more privacy-forward coronavirus tracking models as well, according to Nym Technologies CEO Harry Halpin, although such efforts aren’t connected to any government and are still in a theoretical stage.\nPrivacy experts are concerned about the long-term implications of these programs. Yet, attorney Preston Byrne of Anderson Kill's technology group said there’s reason to believe Americans have legal protections other nations may not.\n“With regard to cellphone location data specifically, in the U.S. citizens enjoy a substantial expectation of privacy in relation to their physical movements,” Byrne said.\nWith regards to subscriber data, like IP addresses and metadata in text messages or emails, Byrne added companies are “not free to provide these communications voluntarily to the government except in very limited circumstances including an emergency involving death or serious bodily injury.”\nIn short, Americans can generally choose which apps to use. American police can’t use mass surveillance to show up at someone’s house if a phone is turned off, as reportedly happened in Taiwan. Even in Israel’s case, courts promptly ruled on which organizations can access and collect data. Plus, Israel’s consumer-facing mobile app, called “Shield” in Hebrew, is open source so anyone can review it.\nIf the White House adopts a comparable software initiative, Americans have a right to choose their connectivity tools and advocate for open source apps. They can also protect their privacy rights in court, according to Byrne.\nBack in Honduras, Gallardo argued technologists should design software programs to specifically do certain things and not allow other types of data collection. Rather than waiting for litigation to assert privacy rights, this can help prevent government overreach in the future.\n“What might it look like if, later down the line, whether you’ve tested positive for coronavirus has an impact on how people view you?” she said. “When you’re designing inclusively, these are questions you’ve asked yourself from the beginning.”",

    "title": "8 US States Follow DHS in Naming 'Blockchain Managers' as Essential Employees in Coronavirus Crisis",
    "summary": "At least eight U.S. states have directed “blockchain managers” in food and agriculture to keep working through COVID-19 shutdowns following guidance from the Department of Homeland Security, though it remains unclear who this includes.",
    "content": "A growing chorus of U.S. states have directed “blockchain managers” in food and agriculture to keep working through their states’ respective COVID-19 shutdowns.\nThe governors of Michigan, Massachusetts, Delaware, Ohio, Louisiana, California, Indiana and Washington state had all issued stay-at-home exemptions for blockchain managers by Tuesday afternoon, covering some 88 million residents currently or soon to be sheltering in place.\nThe orders by governors and their public health officials add legal heft to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) March 19 recommendation that blockchain managers be considered critical infrastructure. CISA is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, and its memo, a fleshing out of U.S. President Donald Trump’s March 16 “Coronavirus Guidance for America,” was non-binding in nature.\n“If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the DHS, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule,” the president’s directive read.\nSee also: Users See ‘Buying Opportunity’ in Coronavirus Market Downturn, Says Crypto.com\nCISA followed up with an extensive nine-page list of “critical infrastructure industries” that included blockchain managers in food and agriculture.\n“Employees and firms supporting food, feed and beverage distribution, including warehouse workers, vendor managed inventory controllers and blockchain managers” must not let the crisis stop their work, the memo advised.\nEight states have used that section verbatim or referenced its umbrella memo in their respective stay-at-home exemption actions, CoinDesk found.\nWhat’s in a job?\nWhat the memo did not specify is what a blockchain manager is or what these apparently critical workers actually do. Neither CISA nor any of the states that have taken action so far responded to requests for comment.\nAllen Gulley, a research fellow at Auburn University's RFID Lab, said the CISA memo likely targets a small cadre of systems engineers working at the administrative level. They’re the ones “making sure that things aren’t going up in flames” across the supply chain.\nHe pointed to IBM Food Trust, one of the industry’s largest enterprise blockchain platforms and a partner of massive supermarket chains from Walmart to Albertsons, both of which track lettuce on its blockchain. They would need a blockchain manager, he said.\n\"You need to have a blockchain manager behind the scenes making sure that everything's going according to plan,” Gulley said.\nThe Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a standards and trade group for the tech industry, believes that blockchain can play “a critical role in national manufacturing.” The group hailed the CISA memo in a tweet last week.\nSee also: The CFTC Just Defined What ‘Actual Delivery’ of Crypto Should Look Like\nCTA’s state and local tech policy director Nathan Trail said blockchain managers keep everything moving.\n“One thing that we forget with [internet of things], blockchain, algorithms and so forth is there's still a very human element that’s necessary in tracking and monitoring the systems to ensure they’re maintained as they should be,” he said.\nExperimental tech – for now\nGulley has worked at the forefront of manufacturing and supply chain blockchain systems, most recently in an RFID Lab trial for Nike. He says the tech is still too new to have much of a presence across major supply chains – food, manufacturing, pharma or otherwise.\n“There are some production grade networks out there where companies are really running their operations on some sort of blockchain platform,” Gulley said. “But there’s far more people that are just playing with it right now.”\nStay-at-home orders are therefore unlikely to kneecap that handful of companies, he said. Plus, their blockchain managers can easily do the job from home.\nEven so, Gulley said CISA’s recommendation and the states' subsequent orders could validate a profession still in its infancy. There’s a certain pride that comes with being labeled “critical infrastructure,” and he said players in the industry are taking note.\n“I think that’s why people have been excited about it,” he said. “It's crisis time and people are recognizing that there’s a blockchain role critical to keep everything functioning.”",

    "summary": "A judge granted Justin Sun’s motion to compel arbitration in a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and workplace harassment at the Tron Foundation.",
    "content": "A court has moved two fired Tron Foundation employees’ claims of wrongful termination and workplace harassment to arbitration.\nOn March 12, the San Francisco Superior Court upheld an arbitration agreement the employees signed when they were hired. The defendants — the Tron Foundation, Tron file-sharing subsidiary BitTorrent, Tron CEO Justin Sun and Tron engineering head Cong Li — filed a motion to compel arbitration on Feb. 19, citing the agreement.\n“The arbitration provisions incorporated the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association,” Judge Ethan Schulman wrote in the order compelling arbitration. “[T]he agreements clearly state each party promises to resolve claims by arbitration.”\nIn arbitration, the case will be heard privately, without a jury trial that would have aired the blockchain non-profit’s dispute in court.\nSee also: Steem Hard Forks Today Over Fears of Justin Sun Power Grab\nThe judge also justified the order on grounds the agreement was attached to an employment contract as a separate document that was not hidden from the employees. Plaintiffs Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek based their arbitration motion's opposition, filed on Feb. 27, on claims the agreement was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis and that they did not read or understand it.\n“Plaintiffs disagree as a matter of law, and we believe the court abused its discretion,” Bill Fitzgerald of Fitzgerald Law Offices, one of two law firms representing Hall and Juraszek, said in an email to CoinDesk.\nAs of Monday, the lawsuit’s proceedings have been paused until further notice due to a California state shutdown of government buildings spurred by the international coronavirus outbreak. A case management conference scheduled for April was moved to October by a blanket county court order.\nLi declined to comment on the arbitration request. Sun and the Tron Foundation’s lawyers at Fisher and Phillips did not respond to requests for comment.\nForced arbitration\nThe Tron Foundation’s response to the litigation comes as technology companies do away with mandatory arbitration in harassment and discrimination lawsuits.\nLast year, Google ended all employee agreements with mandatory arbitration and waived the clause in future agreements, following the precedent set by Facebook, AirBnB and eBay the year before.\nSee also: Tron’s Takeover of Steemit Is Internet History Repeating Itself\nHall and Juraszek alleged in the lawsuit, initiated in October, that they were racially discriminated and retaliated against for being Caucasian, reporting incidents of physical assault by Sun and Li to human resources, and sounding the alarm on child pornography and copyright-infringing content on BitTorrent file-sharing applications.\nTheir firings were the last salvo in the retaliation, Hall and Juraszek contended in the lawsuit.\nBitTorrent, acquired for $120 million by Sun in July 2018, employed Hall as a senior product manager from December 2018 to June 2019 and Juraszek as a software engineer from February to August 2019.",

    "content": "Blockchain startup Fluree, a Public Benefit Corporation, received a $4.7 million round of funding from 4490 Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund, along with Revolution’s Rise of the Rest seed fund, to develop and market their decentralized data storage ecosystem.\nOperating on the principles of complete data integration and immutability, Fluree hopes to eradicate the over-reliance on data silos and API bloat by building bridges off of blockchain technology.\n“Fluree stores all data on a blockchain ledger that can be run internally like a traditional data store, or selectively operated in a data network across parties governed by Fluree SmartFunction rules,” wrote Flip Filipowski, co-CEO and co-founder of Fluree, in a statement.\nThe main goal is to break down trust-barriers between parties that had relied on traditional stores of critical data and spur collaboration across multiple parties by increasing access to and leveraging of data.\nTarget users of this innovation are those that have been hindered by the static, centralized models of data storage as they begin to integrate into an increasingly interconnected, information-centric world. The ledger will be accessible to those inside and outside the host enterprise, and can be used for both centralized or decentralized operations.\n“Data is at the center of the new economy, yet it is managed by the same database approach we’ve had for 40 years,” said Brian Platz, co-CEO and co-founder of Fluree. “A data-centric approach simultaneously saves money, promotes secure enterprise collaboration and provides additional leverage for information across systems.”\nSecurity is another concern Fluree is attempting to solve and to which blockchain provides an answer. To that end, FlureeSmartFunctions dynamically enforces permissions for external parties to access the data, provides proof of data tampering, and guarantees knowledge of who amended or added data.\nThe company acknowledges the tradeoffs involved in decentralization and will offer options to tune a company’s blockchain if speed is preferred over security.\n“If you want 100% decentralization, something like Bitcoin, it’s going to be slow. You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” Platz told TechCrunch. “If you need to, you can decrease the amount of centralization. So there’s a spectrum there, and we focus on giving people the knob to adjust that based on what they’re trying to do,”\nCurrently, a free version of Fluree is available for developers, as well as a scaling-priced option based on usage. Fluree also offers a licensed version for production deployments.\nThe product is set for a 2019 open source release.\nImage via Shutterstock.",

As per Chosun, the UN claims the laundering scheme, which also involved another undisclosed individual linked to the firm, circulated the stolen crypto through upwards of 5,000 transactions in multiple countries to obfuscate its source.\nThe report further states that North Korea has developed precision “spear-phishing” attacks.

    "title": "Bitcoin and Blockchain: The Tangled History of Two Tech Buzzwords",
    "summary": "The word \"blockchain\" isn't used in the bitcoin white paper, the document that started it all. So, how did the term take off as a buzzword?",
    "content": "\"I'm interested in blockchain, not bitcoin.\"\nAdmit it, you've heard this hundreds, if not thousands, of times. (You might have even said it yourself.) And sure, people know what you’re saying, you’re talking about the “technology underlying bitcoin” and you sound smart enough.\nOnce it became known – or at least presumed – that you could apply cryptography in finance, in ways similar to how it’s used in bitcoin, everyone started making sure that statement fell from their lips. And that refrain – kicked off by bitcoin itself – remains powerful today.\nSounds plausible? Sure. But, interestingly, the word \"blockchain\" doesn't actually appear in the original bitcoin white paper, released back in 2008. Rather, the white paper uses the words \"block\" and \"chain\" separately many times.\nIt describes the word \"block\" as the vehicle for a bundle bitcoin transactions. Then, these blocks of are linked together, forming a \"chain\" of \"blocks.\"\nSo, who created this ultimate industry buzzword?\nThat damn blockchain\nTurns out, the origins of the word are not quite so revolutionary.\n\"The word blockchain was never used in the early days,\" former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn told CoinDesk. Although, Hearn did acknowledge that Satoshi often referred to bitcoin's \"proof-of-work chain\" in discussions on forums.\nIt seems the first references to the word came about on Bitcoin Talk, a bitcoin-specific forum created by Satoshi, in July 2010 – more than a year after bitcoin's release.\nAnd at that time, these remarks weren't about how innovative the technology was, but instead were complaints about how long it took to download the bitcoin \"blockchain\" (the entire history of bitcoin transactions).\nWhile compared to today, the download would have far faster, according to one Bitcoin Talk user: \"The initial blockchain download is quite slow.\"\nIn other words, initially, blockchain was far from the sexy word it is today.\nBlockchain mania\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly when the word really took hold.\nBut interest in the term seems to have sprung out of professional organizations and individuals hesitance to align themselves with bitcoin itself because of its bad reputation as the currency for drugs and gray economies.\n\"I think it [became popular] around the time people started going to Washington [D.C.] and trying to make bitcoin respectable by divorcing the currency from the underlying algorithms,\" Hearn said.\nTo many, bitcoin the currency could be decoupled from bitcoin the blockchain protocol, and so a whole new industry of so-called \"private blockchains,\" devoid of a cryptocurrency, emerged. Sure enough, around that time in 2015, Google Trends data show the term surged.\n\"Initially people said 'block chain', and then, thanks to a great PR campaign, we were blessed with the much improved 'blockchain,' single-word, probably thanks to a community-wide effort near and around the Bitcoin Talk forums,\" long-time cryptocurrency developer Greg Slepak said.\nNot only did it become one word, but it also came in vogue to describe any blockchain that wasn't bitcoin's blockchain as \"a blockchain.\" Bitcoin got to keep the terminology \"the blockchain,\" giving credence to the fact that it was the first.\nYet blockchain has become so divorced from bitcoin that both words typically see a similar spike when cryptocurrency prices start mooning. For instance, the word blockchain saw a huge uptick in Google searches in late 2017.\nWorld's first blockchain?\nStill, it's unclear exactly where the idea itself begins. To some, blockchains existed even before bitcoin, although that term wasn't applied to them back then.\nFor instance, cryptographer Stuart Haber, whose whitepapers on timestamping were cited in the bitcoin white paper, claims to have created the first blockchain called Surety.\nAccording to Haber, that has to be the reason why Satoshi cited his work – three times out of just nine total citations. Surety was launched in 1995 for timestamping records, and it's still running today.\nYet, Haber admits that his version doesn't have all the same benefits of bitcoin since it's centralized – managed by one company.\nAnd that highlights where things get tricky when you're talking about a blockchain. See, there isn't necessarily agreement on a single definition of a the technology.\nThe Merriam Webster dictionary actually presents a much older word for blockchain – \"a chain in which the alternate links are broad blocks connected by thin side links pivoted to the ends of the blocks, used with sprocket wheels to transmit power, as in a bicycle.\"\nWhile Google defines blockchain as:\nBut, for those seasoned veterans of the space, even this definition is problematic. Many of these new-age private blockchains don't record their transactions publicly.\n\"The term has become so widespread that it’s quickly losing meaning,\" as The Verge put it earlier this year.\nBlind men\nHaber pointed to an Indian parable to help explain the incompatible descriptions.\nIn the parable, a group of blind men come upon an elephant and start touching the animal to try and figure it out what it was in front of them.\nDepending on what part of the elephant each man is touching, their answer changes. For instance, one of the blind men, touching the elephant's trunk, thinks it's a snake, while the other, touching the elephant's leg, exclaims it's a tree trunk.\nIt's similar when people define blockchain, Haber said.\nHe told CoinDesk:\nAs such, he argues there isn't just one meaning.\nEven though, bitcoiners believe a blockchain can only be the one and only bitcoin blockchain, like words, definitions are always evolving and changing.\nBlockchain shirt image via CoinDesk archives",

    "content": "Universa Platform, a Russian blockchain platform intended for corporate management and state administration, has partnered with a Russian federal subject, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, to help the bucolic region join the digital economy through blockchain enabled technology, according to a company statement.\nThe partnership will create a pilot area for digital technologies and services which aims to make the region, located in Western Siberia, a tourism destination as well as an attractive place for foreign direct investment.\nUniversa’s blockchain platform will be integrated into government operations as an “investment project management service” to control budgeting and prevent misuse of funds. Tracking mechanisms will generate automatic reports when investment funds are spent, ensuring transparency, thereby making the region safer for investors.\nAdditionally, a multi-language communication platform will be developed to provide a single digital ecosystem to be used by the tourism industry. All industry participants -- including “suppliers of tourist products and services, transportation companies delivering the tourists, accommodation and catering facilities, small and medium enterprises providing services in adjacent areas, investors, business support foundations, and finally tourists heading for their vacations in the region” -- will contribute to a “pool of data” that will help identify problems as well as areas where the industry can expand.\nAccording to regional authorities, over 500,000 tourists visited Ugra in 2018. These authorities hope the creation of “a center of competence” within the tourism industry will spur interest in the region.\nThis decision comes on the heels of President Vladimir Putin’s decree made in May 2018, “On National Goals and Strategic Development Objectives of the Russian Federation for the Period of up to 2024,” which aims to “take Russia into the top five largest economies, ensure economic growth rates exceeding international rates, while at the same time maintaining macroeconomic stability, including inflation under 4 percent.”\nAccording to its white paper, Universa uses a contract execution machine and a distributed state ledger to “support token representation of everything from passports to boarding passes, bus tickets or taxi fares; they can be gift cards, vouchers, or gym membership cards.”\nNeither the company, nor Okrug officials, responded to a request for comment.\nThe agreement was signed by Alexander Borodich, CEO of Universa, and Roman Genkel, General Director Ugra Development Foundation at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 7.",

    "content": "Sweden’s central bank has tapped Accenture to develop its e-krona digital currency pilot project, the Riksbank announced in a press release Friday.\nAccenture will build out the e-krona’s consumer-facing features – such as how a user would pay on various mobile platforms – and run them in a test environment with “simulated stores.” Its initial contract lasts for one year, but Riksbank said it is open to as many as seven years of tests.\nRiksbank hasn't committed to issuing an e-krona at this time.\nRegardless of the limitations, the partnership, which the central bank intends to sign later this year, is set to move the Scandinavian nation’s long-awaited e-krona one step closer to reality.\nSuch a development could tap into Sweden’s growing aversion to physical cash. Swedes have flocked so readily to cashless payment alternatives that the Bank of Canada’s Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said physical kronas are falling out of use.\n“You’re actually reaching a tipping point [in Sweden],” Lane said at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s November Fintech conference. “Merchants are increasingly refusing to accept banknotes and banks are increasingly not offering services to process banknotes.”\nCash-free financial headwinds prompted Riksbank to begin studying an e-krona long before the more recent central bank digital currency (CBDC) rush. In 2016 the bank’s Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley said Riksbank was “facing pressure” to move away from coins and bills the public largely balked at.\nIt then began to study an e-krona in depth. Two reports, the first in September 2017 and a followup one year later, outlined everything from a digital currency’s legal ramifications to its impact on bank lending rates.\nNotably, those reports revealed Riksbank’s reticence to base any such digital currency on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT), which Riksbank labeled an “inefficient technology.” But its 2018 report nonetheless stated that “an e-krona should be able to interact with DLT solutions.”\nIt is not clear what technology Accenture’s proposed e-krona will utilize. Riksbank classified the procurement process in its June 2019 proposal solicitation, calling the information “important to national security” in a press release at the time.",

A properly built blockchain system would give broader access to relevant parties and also allow them to purchase supply chain data from their up-stream suppliers.\n“Blockchain is the ideal technology to ensure that data on performance and risk, which underpin all supply chain finance transactions, can be shared in an authenticated manner with financiers and other parties to a transaction, even when there is no direct relationship between them,” the authors wrote.\nSee also: 8 US States Follow DHS in Naming ‘Blockchain Managers’ as Essential Employees in Coronavirus Crisis\nRecord digitization is Fan's and Liao’s other partial solution to this crisis.

    "summary": "Blockchain might help major apparel brands from Nike to Macy’s better share their product data across the retail supply chain, according to a new white paper from Auburn University’s RFID Lab.",
    "content": "Blockchain might help major apparel brands from Nike to Macy’s better share product data across the retail supply chain, according to a white paper Auburn University’s RFID Lab published Wednesday.\nThe study, named the “Chain Integration Project\" (CHIP), saw those retailers and others run Hyperledger Fabric nodes on a slice of their mammoth supply chains. The study found blockchain to be a promising way to share serialized data after following tens of thousands of products including Nike Kids’ Air Force 1 shoes and Michael Kors parkas as they moved between distribution centers.\nRFID Lab is one of the most prominent outposts for U.S. retailers’ experiments with emerging supply chain tech, but Blockchain Fellow Allan Gulley said it’s a relative newcomer to distributed ledger technology. And so CHIP, which began in 2018, became a blockchain trial by fire for the Auburn research institute.\nMany retailers have already been keeping internal tabs on product movements via radio frequency identification (RFID) tags installed in every unit. As one example, Gulley said every box of Nike shoes comes with an RFID tag that helps the athletics giant track its sprawling inventory. However, different retailers tags store data differently and there’s little to no data interoperability.\n“Everyone was speaking a different language.” Gulley said. “The way they sent data to us was wildly different from one company to another. There wasn’t a good common language in place and there wasn’t a common platform for them to share that data.”\nThat gave the RFID Lab two opportunities: Build retailers a common language, and build them a platform.\nThe language aspect took up about 70 percent of the researchers’ time, Gulley said. With the help of the many students who operate the lab, Gulley’s team built a \"translator tool\" that reworks different data streams into the EPCIS standard developed by Belgian non-profit GS1.\nImplementing Hyperledger Fabric was simpler but still came with its own set of dilemmas, Gulley said. Rookie-level bugs throttled the system’s initial transaction throughput – the team was measuring in seconds per transaction instead of transactions per second – but optimization increased throughput by over 6,500 percent.\n“We realized pretty quickly how unproven the blockchain technology really is,” Gulley said.\nHe compared this study to other high-profile blockchain supply chain trials, like the IBM Food Trust. Those systems track shipments in sum. Gulley said CHIP, which looked at reams of data for specific products, was far more “granular,” and as such more complex.\nIn the final design, each retail pair had a different \"channel\" where the pair could run its own closed proof of concept. Nike’s vertically integrated supply chain was all in-house, but more interlinked retailers and brands had support from tech vendors and others.\nThe proof of concept ultimately saw thousands of products matched across its nodes. Nike recorded 72,575 items from encoder to distribution center; PVH and Kohl’s recorded 3,766; and Macy’s, which had the trial’s most complex supply chain of – a HermanKay distribution center, a Macy’s distribution center, and a Macy’s store – matched 62 products across all three, according to the study.\nIn total, 222,974 items were written onto the blockchain, according to the study. It needs to take on more, though, if it is to go mainstream.\n“The system as it stands right now can process what we need it to, but in the long term we're talking about billions of products flowing through the retail supply chain with these RFID tags. There needs to be a much more robust system in place to handle that,” Gulley said.\nRFID Lab will now take its blockchain study to a “consultancy” phase of sorts, trying to understand just how much value DLT and RFID data sharing systems can offer the businesses, who, by virtue of their size, can reap millions of dollars in efficiencies with only minor tweaks to their business practices.\nGulley predicted blockchain’s long-term viability in the supply chain space will rely on a more robust network of service providers being there to assist its growth.\n“For the next phase of this work there's absolutely going to have to be more involvement and engagement from technology players. If this thing continues to grow beyond a handful of nodes and a handful of operators it's going to get big pretty fast.”",

They then \"leveraged Google Adwords to poison user search results in order to steal users' wallets,\" thereby directing more traffic to those pages.\nCisco traced the group's activity back to as early as 2015 and estimated that \"tens of millions of dollars\" in cryptocurrency had been stolen since that year. They indicated that as much as $50 million had been stolen, including $2 million in less than 4 weeks during one period last year.\n\"What is clear from the COINHOARDER campaign is that cryptocurrency phishing via Google Adwords is a lucrative attack on users worldwide,\" the firm concluded.\nImage via Shutterstock",

It will add QR codes to Zoégas’ “Summer 2020” coffee product packaging, sold in Sweden. When scanned, these codes will show consumers their beans’ journey from harvest to shelf, with documentation stored on IBM’s food tracing blockchain.\nIBM Food Trust will get part of that data from the sustainable product certification nonprofit the Rainforest Alliance and the rest from Nestlé. That marks a change of stance for the multinational food conglomerate, which had “limited” third party supply chain data in previous QR code traceable product campaigns.\n“Up until now we had been testing the best way to deploy IBM Food Trust internally alongside current systems,” a Nestlé spokesperson told CoinDesk. “We had to first build a robust knowledge and knowhow base on our deployment before linking our data to other organizations for an end to end view.”\nAfter three years of IBM Food Trust trials and with two open-data product launches on the books, Nestlé felt that Food Trust was ready for more data sources, a sentiment the Nestlé spokesperson said Rainforest Alliance shared.\n“They certify many of our coffees, but they were also very open to innovation to bring this information to consumers in a different way,” the spokesperson said.\nNestlé said the collaboration did not pose much of a technical challenge as IBM Food Trust has become “fairly mature” and Rainforest Alliance was willing to invest time and effort to make it work.\nRainforest Alliance has experience tracing coffee products with blockchain systems as a client of the supply chain software firm ChainPoint. (ChainPoint is separate from the open source Chainpoint protocol). A spokesperson for the Alliance did not immediately respond to questions about whether ChainPoint was being used in the Nestlé collaboration.\nNestlé’s previous Northern European blockchain product pilots make it confident that Zoégas will “resonate” with the Swedes, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to state how many consumers have scanned previous QR code campaigns, “but we have seen a great level of engagement so far.”\nBlockchain traceable coffee is a marketing trend being seen across the coffee industry, and the world. Starbucks is working with Microsoft’s Azure blockchain to bring its consumers “farm to cup” information, as is Medici ventures-backed GrainChain, and IBM, which in January debuted a coffee tracing app.",

A memo following the RFP states, “Suggested areas of application... include antifraud, contracts, medical marijuana, records, notarization, registration and licensing, investigative evidence control and more.”\nBrenna McCabe, director of public affairs for the Department of Administration in Rhode Island, told Government Technology that this long list of possible applications is meant to entice more bidders, all of whom are required to submit two proofs of concept for blockchain application.\nMcCabe said state officials did not want to stifle the ingenuity of the industry by limiting the scope of the RFP.\nIt’s only after the state receives proposals that they can conceive of what the technology offers. “With proofs of concept, [Rhode Island] can gain a better understanding of the maturity of blockchain technologies and platforms, as well as potential sustainability in state government operations,” the memo stated.\nThe proposals will be reviewed by a technical evaluation committee composed of staff from various state agencies. “The initial contract period is estimated to begin Aug. 13 for a time period determined by the winning bid(s),” according to the RFP.\nAnticipated problems will stem from laws, regulations and licensing structures that would require changes to allow for blockchain use, said McCabe. Though state leaders will have a better idea of what needs to be tweaked once proposals are reviewed.\nRhode Island Capitol image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Representatives from the Department of Homeland Security, Maersk and UPS described how blockchain can be used in supply chain in a hearing Tuesday.",
    "content": "\"I think the applications are almost limitless.\"\nSo said Douglas Maughan – who serves as the Science and Technology Directorate's cybersecurity division director, a group within the Department of Homeland Security – before two Congressional subcommittees on Tuesday. Maughan's remarks came during a wider discussion on the application of blockchain to supply chains, joining a panel of witnesses that included Maersk head of global trade digitization Michael White, UPS vice president of global customs brokerage staff Chris Rubio and Nuby Law IPR counsel Robert Chiaviello.\nAnnounced last week, the “Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Improve Supply Chain Management and Combat Counterfeit Goods” hearing is the second such event hosted by the House Science, Space and Technology Committee’s Oversight and Research and Technology subcommittees this year.\nAs expected\n, the session was largely educational in nature. But even still, as articulated by Maughn, such discussions can have a significant impact on the work being done by U.S. agencies on the blockchain front.\nAccording to Maughn, the Science and Technology Directorate \"must aggressively work with its research, development, test and evaluation partners throughout government and industry so Homeland Security applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology are effective and trusted.\"\nIndeed, in his \"limitless\" remark, Maughan suggested that the scale of work was spread throughout the U.S. government.\n“I think the applications are almost limitless and it’s up to the departments or agencies as to how to address that,\" he told the subcommittees, later noting that not every potential use case requires a blockchain.\n'There must be a better way'\nWhite, appearing on behalf of shipping giant Maersk, framed the firm's move toward applications of blockchain as a way to break up the iceberg-like state of shipping today.\nHe began by describing how the shipping industry works at present, noting in particular that “the industry operates much as it does or has since the introduction of shipping containers in the 1950s.”\nTransactions are filed through fax machines and documents about shipments are sent by way of carrier mail – and can sometimes arrive too late, he said, adding:\nThat collaboration utilized a blockchain to create an immutable, but efficient record, he said.\nUPS’s Rubio expanded on this concept, noting that “by having the ability to track any product from the beginning of its journey through the supply chain, blockchain may provide a solution to unknown or unverified product origins.”\n“In fact, we are already seeing this tech used to track origins of various products,” he went on to say.\nWhen asked how exactly blockchain can help the shipping industry, White remarked that “blockchain is especially suitable for that because you can enable the parties which have a right to see and have access to information and see that information has not been tampered with or modified in any way, shape or form.”\n\"By posting information in real time to the supply chain data can be shared and that can streamline the flow of goods. The benefit to the consumer is they can receive their product sooner,\" Rubio asserted.\nWhat the members said\nThough the session largely saw the witnesses sharing their views and input on blockchain, the hearing did present some opportunities for subcommittee members to offer a window into their thinking on the technology.\nAt the outset, Rep. Ralph Abraham – who chaired the hearing – positioned the event as one that would look at both private and public-sector use.\n\"We recognize [blockchain] technologies can benefit both the public and private sectors, and seek to understand just how,\" he told attendees.\nAs might be expected, the subject of cryptocurrencies crept into the hearing, with one lawmaker suggesting that those present ought to look into \"the technology beneath it.\"\n“If we can overlook the stigma of cryptocurrency and look at the technology beneath it I think we can see [useful applications],\" Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia remarked at one point.\nRep. Don Bayer of Virginia declared that, in his view, the U.S. ought to play a major role in advancing the tech more broadly.\n\"I believe America should take the lead in blockchain research,\" he said.\nCapitol Hill image via Shutterstock",

The Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute software was first released last August.\nThat software was released on an \"as is\" basis, according to the release notes, \"and will not be supported with further updates, upgrades or bug fixes\" – suggesting that, for the time being, AMD isn't eyeing regular fixes for cryptocurrency-related problems.\nThe drivers were unique in that they were \"not intended for graphics or gaming workloads,\" according to the company’s release notes.\nStepping back, the move is just the latest from GPU manufacturers whose products have been swept up by cryptocurrency miners.\nAMD, in particular, noted in its most recent 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that a decline in the cryptocurrency market could hurt its business if miners buy fewer GPUs, as previously reported.\nHowever, an analyst with Jeffries does not see this as a likely possibility, as Mark Lipacis wrote last year that he expects demand to continue.\nRows of GPUs image via Shutterstock",

Agrawal told CoinDesk that these resources include educational and marketing tools, as well as datasets for training the startup's neural network.\nNvidia Inception Program head Arjun Dutt confirmed that Ubex is part of the incubation program, but said its use of blockchain \"was not a significant factor in our consideration.\" Rather, it's Ubex's planned application that caught the company's eye.\n\"The main area of interest is their use of deep learning [and] neural networks for better online advertising algorithms,\" he said.\nNvidia CEO via Flickr",

    "content": "The Russian government may soon allow the creation of regulatory sandboxes for companies working on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and distributed ledgers.\nIntroduced in a new bill on March 17 by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the plan does not directly mention blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but an explanatory note mentions distributed ledger as one of the technologies that could be explored in the new “experimental regulatory regimes.”\nSuch regimes can be established to live-test the new technologies in medicine, transporation, distant learning, financial markets, online commerce and other sectors. The bill gives Russia’s regulators scope to deal with novel tech in a more flexible way, the document says. It’s also suggested that the country’s regions would be able to set up their own local sandboxes.\nThe Bank of Russia, the central bank, will be supervising the sandboxes related to fintech. Representatives of the Economic Development Ministry, which initiated the bill, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia that fintech projects operating within sandboxes would be subject to lighter regulation regarding cash reserves, financial reporting and foreign currency controls.\nReal cases, real clients\nOlga Shepeleva, a senior expert at the Center for Strategic Research, a Moscow-based think tank that helped draft the bill, told CoinDesk the law should have already been passed as a part of the government’s program on developing the digital economy in Russia. However, there were concerns that such a law would excessively skew the power balance in favor of the executive branch.\n“The main idea is that the government can choose to make a temporary exceptions from laws and regulations” for the sandboxes, Shepeleva said.\nThe Bank of Russia has already been running a regulatory sandbox for fintech projects, and has even reported successfully testing a blockchain-based tokenization pilot by the mining and smelting company Nornickel.\nHowever, the central bank’s sandbox only helps to model the possible uses of the new technologies, but does not allow businesses to test their use cases on real clients; neither does it provide the means for expert and public control over such experiments. The new bill will allow the creation of sandboxes in which real businesses will be working with real customers, Shepeleva explained.\nNo crypto\nRussia’s central bank has consistently maintained a skeptical stance towards cryptocurrencies and has recently said it's involved in drafting legislation that will block crypto marketplaces from operating in the country, though ownership would likely be tolerated.\nMikhail Komin, research director at the Center for Advanced Governance in Moscow, said Russia is unlikely to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies anytime soon, saying: “For sure, the [coronavirus] pandemic and the financial crisis makes the government look for unorthodox solutions, but crypto is not a part of that.”.\n“The Bank of Russia is interested in lowering uncertainty in the financial and foreign currency markets caused by the volatility of the Russian ruble, and it believes cryptocurrencies would add even more uncertainty,” Komin said. \"The Bank of Russia’s position remains the winning one in this argument.\"",

    "title": "Blockchain's First Hardware Wallet Will Let You Trade Crypto for Crypto",
    "summary": "Blockchain, one of the oldest software wallet providers, is launching its first hardware wallet with a crypto-to-crypto trading feature.",
    "content": "One of the oldest software wallet providers in the cryptocurrency industry is launching its first hardware product.\nAnnounced Thursday, Blockchain has partnered with hardware wallet maker Ledger and started taking orders for a new handheld device called Lockbox. The first batch of shipments will go out in November.\nWhile there are a number of hardware wallets on the market, Lockbox stands out in two ways, according to Blockchain CEO and co-founder Peter Smith. First, in addition to storing funds offline like other devices, it will facilitate crypto-to-crypto trades through Swap, the company's native brokerage, which is launching next week.\nThe aim is to make trading easier with an all-in-one account, Smith told CoinDesk, explaining:\nFurther, unlike other hardware wallets, Lockbox is \"endpoint-controlled,\" Smith said. In other words, while the wallet connects to the internet by plugging into a computer, a special key set inside the device will only allow it to connect with legitimate websites, deflecting phishing attempts by fake versions of external platforms like MyEtherWallet, for example.\nMuch like Blockchain's online platform, which garnered nearly 30 million accounts since its founding in 2011, the Lockbox will mainly support bitcoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash. However, the team said they are willing to consider adding support for additional assets if there's proven user demand.\nSmith added that although his company will be selective about which assets it supports on Lockbox, the Swap brokerage will allow the whole Blockchain platform to expand crypto offerings faster than ever before because it will not be solely reliant on external liquidity sources.\n\"We built a machine trading platform,\" he said. \"It connects to different liquidity [sources] across the ecosystem, everything from different exchanges to market makers.\"\nAs a result, \"I think we will be more aggressive on adding assets in the next six months,\" Smith said. \"In the long run, I see our trading system being both a consumer and a provider to DEXs,\" or decentralized exchanges, where traders retain custody throughout the process.\nReducing friction\nAll this will be made easier by Ledger's full scope of support for a variety of cryptocurrencies, scheduled to reach support for 100 assets by 2019.\n\"It's the first big deal between our two companies and there may be more in the future,\" Ledger president Pascal Gauthier told CoinDesk. \"When we design technology for us, we design also for our partners. So whatever features we make for the Nano S, we will also make available for our partners, should they have the need.\"\nIn the meantime, altcoin traders will be able to pair Ledger's multi-coin Nano S devices with Blockchain wallets for a smoother trading experience.\nWhile Ledger handles the manufacturing side of Lockbox, Blockchain is focused on creating a holistic mobile and platform experience. This collaboration is indicative of a broader shift among industry incumbents seeking to reduce friction for traders, who must generally juggle multiple exchange and wallet accounts, and conduct extensive research about platforms' security before connecting their devices.\n\"With our products, you can go from cold to hot [storage] in a heartbeat and the device will never reveal the key, so it means that it opens many avenues, especially for traders,\" Gauthier said.\nConcurring with Smith on the role of hardware wallets in DEX platforms, he added:\nSpeaking broadly to hardware wallet innovations over the past year, Johns Hopkins cryptography professor Matthew Green told CoinDesk the crypto industry is \"relearning some of the lessons that smart cards and the secure devices community have learned over the years\" about security.\nOn the other hand, Green said there are still design factors that could help improve the devices' usability, such as more buttons for entering passcodes without relying on a computer for account management.\nIn Green's mind, the perfect hardware wallet would let users \"generate transactions directly without connecting to your computer.\"\nNikhilesh De contributed reporting.\nLockbox image courtesy of Blockchain",

    "content": "A new patent application from IBM outlines a way for developers to catalog coding updates and milestones on a blockchain.\nThe application – entitled \"Blockchain For Program Code Credit and Programmer Contribution in a Collective\" – was published on July 5 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It envisions utilizing the technology to create \"a secure and robust approach to track and to append information related to collaborative coding for the purpose of credit, reward, and dispute resolution, and for other purposes.\"\nPut more simply, the idea is to use a distributed network to track the accomplishments of coders as they work together on a project. As the application suggests, such tracking can be used to properly credit design elements to specific programmers.\nAs IBM argues in the application, programmers normally need to collaborate to produce a software product, but an effective approach measuring a programmer's contribution is lacking. The principle underlying the proposed patent is a chain that chronicles the code transactions and parameters on blockchain blocks.\nAs IBM goes on to explain:\n\"Once the new block has been calculated, it can be appended to the stakeholder's application software history blockchain, as described above. The block may be updated in response to many triggers, such as, when a programmer selects a button on a graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer display showing a code editor to add code, when a unit test has been completed, when a code integration is completed, when an assigned work item is closed, and so forth,\" the company goes on to note..\nIBM itself is no stranger to intellectual property bids tied to blockchain technology, as the USPTO routinely publishes filings submitted by IBM.\nFor example, one application filed in April shows that the tech juggernaut is seeking to patent a method for ensuring that a network of connected devices can securely execute blockchain-based smart contracts.\nImage via Shutterstock",

Many have been speculating since then the possibility that the Enjin wallet will be integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore on S10.\nENJ is a cryptocurrency for virtual goods, namely in-game items that can be exchanged, traded or swapped cross platform with the potential to create entirely new in-game e-commerce ecosystems utilizing the ERC-1155 token based on the Ethereum blockchain.\nWhere it all began\nRumors began circulating Feb. 25 with this image aligned to the Samsung Blockchain Keystore and a leaked video of the Samsung Mobile Business Development Summit featuring Enjin’s logo.\nSince then price action has given way to speculation as investors piled on to take advantage of the bullish announcements.\nDaily chart\nThat sparked a frenzy of self-perpetuating investor interest as it rose 206 percent before closing out 116 percent up on the previous day.\nENJ also experienced another major spike on March 5 after announcing their Blockchain Software Development Kit (SDK) is due to launch on March 14, which helped price close out 27.5 percent higher while March 8 put those gains to shame rising another 76.1 percent over a 24-hour period to where it currently stands.\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\nEnjin Coin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View",

The Regulation of Cryptocurrencies\" panel in New York on Wednesday, Vullo said that her view is \"regulation in this space, just like any space where you have money transmission, [is necessary],\" making a point she often revisited during the discussion.\nWhile some state and federal regulars are taking time to create rules for the industry, \"it certainly hasn't taken New York long to establish a framework\" for regulating cryptocurrencies, Vullo said in her opening statement, referring to the state's controversial BitLicense.\nThe role of regulation in the cryptocurrency space was a contentious topic, with Blockchain president and chief legal officer Marco Santori claiming regulators should ease up on the over-regulation.\nThat said, he did acknowledge that \"a lot of token sales run afoul of the spirit of the law, if not the letter of the law. But we have to be careful not to lump them all together.\"\nIn particular, he argued that New York's laws \"have been an abject failure.\"\nHowever, Vullo derided developers who claim that their work should allow them to launch token sales free of disclosure or other requirements, saying:\nIn another rapid exchange, CNN investigative journalist and panelist Jose Pagliery expressed concern about the idea that \"code is law,\" saying that while this may be true, coders can modify certain protocols:\nSantori disagreed with this premise, saying \"that is not only a bad question, you should feel bad for asking it.\"\nIn turn, Vullo said: \"I didn't know this was about feelings.\"\nSeema Mody, Jose Pagliery, Marco Santori and Maria Vullo image by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk",

We’re going to have competitors.”\n“I tell our people, don’t guess, you know they’re there, you know they’re coming, you know they want to eat our lunch. Assume it.”\nWhether it’s a bank or a crypto service startup, Dimon said there are serious issues regarding the future of money. He believes some of these are caused by the government, specifically in determining whether they will be subject to banking regulations, KYC, the bank secrecy act, or anti-money laundering rules.\nSympathetic to the crypto industry’s desire to serve their clients, Dimon also said he’d “want to be able to serve their clients.”\n“I always look at these [blockchain] systems like we’d like to do some of it too, ourselves.”\nJamie Dimon photo courtesy of flickr/Stefen Chow",

    "summary": "If you have ten games then you need ten blockchains says Planetarium's CEO Kijun Seo.",
    "content": "South Korean blockchain game startup Planetarium is planning to launch a test version of a new decentralized game, Nine Chronicles, later in this month. The role-playing game will store its storyboard and data all on a blockchain.\nIts own blockchain.\nThis is the first game developed with Planetarium’s game authoring tool which will be officially released as an open source platform this year. Once Libplanet, the authoring tool, is made public by the end of this year, developers will be able to use it to make games as well as blockchains for the games.\nPlanetarium CEO Kijun Seo thinks blockchain game developers are shoehorning games into existing blockchain platforms like ethereum or EOS. Instead, Planetarium suggests that a game should be made and run in an independent and complete ecosystem, which means that if there are ten games, there should be ten different blockchain platforms made for each game.\n“Decisions about the game are to be determined by the needs of the games, not by the platform. We should define the game first, not the blockchain underneath it,” Seo said.\nPlanetarium expects that its open-source platform will let the users create their own versions of games following the example of the legendary online game League of Legends.\nAn earlier game, Warcraft III, featured a popular custom map made by gamers which led to the birth of League of Legends, Seo noted, adding that blockchain can remove hindrances to such creativity:\nPlanetarium has already attracted seed investment from South Korean venture capital firms and it plans to adopt a dual-license system, encouraging the use of open source code but receiving funds for commercial uses.\nOriginally published on CoinDesk Korea.

    "content": "Walmart has yet another delivery-focused blockchain patent in the works.\nThe application published on July 5 is entitled \"Delivery Reservation Apparatus and Method,\" and as suggested, it outlines a way for managing package reservations in the context of the purchaser not being available to actually receive it.\nIt's the latest \"smart delivery\" intellectual property play from the retail giant, which in the past year has submitted a number of U.S. patent applications in this area. Indeed, the company seems to be looking at the technology as a way to automate elements of the delivery process, but to date, much of the company's public-facing work with blockchain has been focused on food supply chain tracking.\nIn the newly released filing, Walmart detail system of delivery lockers – located at a person's home, transportation hub or other location – that can safeguard the delivered items until their recipients can come and actually sign for them. Blockchain fits into the conceived picture as a method of connecting those lockers in order to track which ones are occupied and which ones are free to be used.\n\"Each space on the docking station has a corresponding capacity unit for each location on the docking station. The transactions for the capacity units are tracked in a ledger, with available capacity units indicating an open location on the docking station or contracted out capacity units indicating that either the location has a locker secured thereto or that the location is reserved for a future delivery,\" Walmart wrote, going on to add:\nThe application makes frequent reference to a \"public ledger,\" suggesting that the proposed system would be openly accessible to some extent rather than closed off to certain participants. That leger, according to the filing, \"contains a record of available and reserved capacity units for the plurality of locker docking stations.\"\nThis perhaps suggests that Walmart wouldn't necessarily be the only operator of these docking stations, and possibly is aimed at enabling a degree of participation by outside parties.\nImage via Shutterstock",

    "content": "A Virginia lawmaker is pushing her commonwealth’s government to study how blockchain could shape the future of local elections and commerce.\nOn Jan. 8, Delegate Hala Ayala (D-51) offered two bills to the House of Delegates: the first calling for Virginia’s Department of Elections to investigate blockchain as a means to secure elections, and the second requesting the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) research blockchain’s current and coming role in the Old Dominion's economy.\nTogether, they comprise Ayala’s political drive to embrace – or at least consider – integrating distributed ledger technology in Virginia life.\nThey’re also a product of Ayala’s subject matter expertise. She was an information security specialist with the U.S. Coast Guard for nearly 20 years before transitioning to a cybersecurity role at the Transportation Security Administration in 2017, where she continues to work.\n“Right now blockchain is a thriving technology,” said Ayala, who was appointed chairhttps://www.ayalafordelegate.com/publications/delegate-hala-ayala-chair-technology-and-innovation-subcommittee of the newly formed Technology and Innovation Subcommittee last week.\nThe bills outline Ayala’s proposed roadmap to studying blockchain technologies. This is most clear in her election bill. It's a response to the ongoing threat of election interference by “bad actors,” she said.\nBut it's also a detailed prescription to get ahead of future attacks. With text imploring the Virginia Department of Elections to study current blockchain voting mechanisms, perform a cost-benefit analysis and then determine “whether and how to implement blockchain” in elections, the bill offers a path to possible implementation.\n“We have to take blockchain very seriously and understand it has the mechanics and mechanisms that could potentially provide us with more secure election protection,” Ayala said.\nThe economy bill, too, would nudge blockchain toward more widespread implementation in Virginia, with two years of mandated studies on the tech’s prevalence and role in intrastate commerce.\nIf passed, VEDP would produce multiple reports outlining what the government should do to foster sector growth. Ayala said it would also tamp down on corporate overreach, keeping companies honest.\nWhile Ayala hopes the reports will shed light on how the commonwealth can take advantage of this relatively new technology, she has not yet committed to implementing blockchain tools.\n\"We need to do our homework first to see how we can apply these technologies to their businesses as well as our elections,\" she said.\nUltimately, her economics bill seeks to create “a statewide, comprehensive, and coordinated strategy relating to blockchain technology,” the text reads.\n“Technology is always ever evolving, and we want to make sure that we are on the forefront and leading the way here in the commonwealth,” Ayala said.",

It comes as competing base layers like Avalanche, Fantom and others pony up large funds to reward projects in an increasingly competitive space.\n“We think that Harmony has the right vision for creating wealth together, for having the infrastructure and platform to do it,” Harmony founder Stephen Tse told CoinDesk.\nThe company will allocate $180 million over the next year with $50 million going to 100 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that can then decide how to use the capital, including supporting smaller projects. There’s an additional $30 million going to partner organizations that have deployed on Harmony and can reach end-users.\nThe foundation will distribute most of the remaining funds, which it has built up in a reserve fund from investors and current network participants through different-sized grants, rewards and investments. Small groups of network participants will vote on individual projects.\n“When we started this project, we allocated a token that network validators and investors would get a certain reward, but there are huge reserves,” Tse said.\nHarmony is a proof-of-stake blockchain that claims to process transactions in two seconds at a low cost. It raised $18 million in an April 2019 token sale to strategic investors and the following month, sold an additional $5 million worth of tokens via an initial exchange offering on the Binance Launchpad.",

    "summary": "The first retail version of a professional blockchain analytics tool on the market will be more limited in what it can do than Crystal’s paid product.",
    "content": "Cryptocurrency sleuthing firm Crystal Blockchain has introduced a free version of its transaction-tracing tool available to anyone curious about the provenance of their – or others’ – coins.\nCrystal Block Explorer will be the first retail version of a professional blockchain analytics tool on the market. The tool is more limited in what it can do than Crystal Expert, the vendor’s flagship paid product.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nWhile partly a marketing play for Crystal, the free product could be useful to ordinary users, researchers and journalists who can’t afford a subscription to software that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars annually.\nIn particular, users will be able to check if their crypto or a transaction of interest has ties to any known entity in the cryptocurrency market – for example, if the funds come from a certain exchange or are connected to a known fraudulent scheme. They will also see a risk score for their crypto, calculated by Crystal, indicating the chances the funds can get frozen on an exchange because of the coins’ transaction history.\n“It’s not only financial institutions that want to better understand their activity related to digital assets – every cryptocurrency user wants to be able to understand more about the funds they are about to accept,” Marina Khaustova, CEO of Crystal Blockchain, told CoinDesk.\nCrystal’s paid product is now used by “more than 1,900 customers, most of which are digital assets service providers, including Upbit, Coinspaid and Rain,” she said.\nMom-and-pop detectives\nThere is a budding industry of vendors providing anti-money laundering (AML) tools to exchanges and other crypto businesses. Such tools allow crypto firms to identify and freeze funds with suspected criminal origins, coming from hacks, exploits, scams or terrorism financing schemes.\nChainalysis, CipherTrace and Elliptic are some well-known companies in the market. In addition to serving private-sector clients, these vendors help government agencies navigate the frontier of cryptocurrency transactions.\nThere are also a handful of free tools like Walletexplorer and OXT that can help ordinary users draw connections between bitcoin addresses that may belong to the same entity – a challenging task when analyzing on-chain transactions. Those free tools, however, don’t always allow users to attribute a transaction to a particular known entity.\nThere are also paid retail products that allow users to quickly check if funds have been labeled as criminal in transaction-tracing systems (like those of Cipher Trace, Chainalysis, Crystal and Elliptic), which means that exchanges will likely freeze funds coming from such blacklisted addresses. That category includes Antinalysis and AMLbot – the latter, in turn, uses Crystal’s database.\nIn the case of Crystal’s new free tool, users will have limited access to the company’s proprietary data on who owns certain wallets, and they also will be able to generate charts that show the chains of connected transactions.\nThe free tool will let a user look up the owners of particular addresses a limited number of times per day, while the paid version doesn’t have that cap. Users of the free version also won’t be able to see attributions to high-risk entities, including darknet marketplaces, crypto mixers and scams.\nThe ability to check the legitimacy of counterparties is “crucially important to day-to-day use and adoption of digital assets in general,” Khaustova said.\n“This equality of data readability is something we at Crystal believe should be a basic right for any digital asset user,” she said. “Transparency is a core crypto ecosystem value.”",

Within the Onyx suite of services, JPMorgan uses tokenization to represent real assets like U.S. Treasurys for intraday repo, done on a permissioned version of Ethereum called Quorum.\nJPMorgan declined to comment.",

    "summary": "If the future of blockchain is multi-chain, then Axie’s Ronin is leading the way, according to new research.",
    "content": "A farming simulator clogged a popular blockchain for days on end last week. Now a new research report from blockchain analytics firm Nansen sheds light on a possible solution.\nAt its peak in November, Ronin, a layer 2 product from Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis devoted solely to the game, processed 560% more total transactions than the Ethereum blockchain, the report found. And while that figure has since retreated, the sidechain is still processing more than up-and-coming networks such as Avalanche and Fantom.\nNansen data journalist Martin Lee said the report offers a glimpse into a particular multi-chain future, one where many layer 1 blockchains focus on specific use cases out of necessity.\n“A lot of blockchains, whether they like it or not, will specialize. Even though creators might not plan for it, developers will force them to go a separate way, purely because of the trade-offs different chains have – developers will be attractive to developers for specific reasons,” he said.\nAxie’s reach\nAxie Infinity – the crown jewel of crypto’s still-nascent “play-to-earn” sector – has 2.8 million daily active users, and as a result, Ronin is processing 40% more transactions than Avalanche, one of the most popular layer 1s by transaction volume.\nLee noted that this figure was achieved in spite of typhoon season disrupting player activities in the Philippines, home to nearly half of Axie’s users.\nThe vast majority of the transactions are worth less than $1,000, and fees are free on the chain for up to 100 transactions.\n“What stood out to me was the sheer number of transactions on the chain relative to other layer 1 solutions like Avalanche or Fantom,” Lee said. “That alone is a signal for other, similar layer 2s to be created. If one single game demands so much out of the underlying blockchain, what happens when a chain is home to multiple games?”\nPolygon’s proof-of-stake chain recently got a taste of what game-related congestions can look like. Transaction costs, which can often be fractions of a cent, ran as high as $0.50, and users griped about failed transactions for days – all because a simple farming simulator game clogged the chain with bot activity.\nRead more: Polygon Under Accidental Attack From Swarm of Sunflower Farmers\nAdditionally, Ronin users are engaging with advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality by depositing into decentralized exchange liquidity pools and Axie’s staking module, despite having lower account balances – a trend that would be unlikely to play out on most layer 1s due to fees.\n“These users would be priced out of using Uniswap, for example,” Lee said, referring to an automated market maker.",

    "content": "Security token specialist Polymath announced Monday its institutional-grade blockchain built specifically for regulated assets – Polymesh – will go live next month, with a target launch date of Oct. 13.\nAnnounced at Messari’s Mainnet event in New York City, the Polymesh network was designed to iron out the wrinkles encountered when shares in private companies are tokenized on Ethereum, for example. The Polymesh mainnet launch follows about a year of testing, including the last five months on an incentivized testnet with some 4,300 users, the company said.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nPolymesh, a standalone blockchain built using Substrate, the same framework Polkadot is built on, will launch with 14 financially regulated entities acting as operators running validator nodes, including the likes of Entoro Capital, Tokenise and the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX).\nStock tokens 2.0\nIssuing tokenized assets on blockchains opens up a super-efficient realm of new possibilities. But Ethereum and its ERC-20 token standard weren’t really designed with regulated players in mind, said Graeme Moore, head of tokenization at Polymath. (Back in 2019, Polymath helped spearhead the security token-focused ERC-1400 standard with mechanisms to restrict its usage based on identity, jurisdiction and asset category.)\nThere are a number of non-starters on Ethereum for regulated companies looking to issue and trade tokenized assets, according to Moore, such as the risk of forks, the need for know-your-customer (KYC) checks, the headache for institutions caused by probabilistic settlement and also the current cost of using the Ethereum mainnet.\n“Polymesh has a forkless architecture and also a concept of identity at the base layer, so you have to go through a KYC process,” Moore said in an interview, adding:\nAs well as the public launch of the proof-of-stake Polymesh network with its native POLYX token, the startup is also announcing the launch of the Polymesh Association, a non-profit based in Switzerland. The Polymesh Association will be equipped with $8 million and 250 million POLYX to offer for grants and incentives, according to a press release.\nSetting up in Switzerland also involved a nod from the country’s markets regulator FINMA, said Moore.\n“In Swiss law, I believe you can either be a payment token, a utility token or an asset token,” said Moore. “So we went through FINMA’s whole regulatory regime, and they’ve determined that POLYX is a utility token.”",

    "summary": "Bitcoin outflows from over-the-counter desks spiked, signaling dip-demand from institutional investors.",
    "content": "Blockchain data shows large investors remain confident of bitcoin's long-term prospects and continue to accumulate coins on dips, shrugging off concerns about the negative environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining.\nWallets linked with over-the-counter (OTC) desks registered an outflow of 10,292 BTC on Wednesday, when bitcoin tanked from $43,000 to nearly $30,000. That was the largest single-day outflow from OTC addresses in 3.5 months, according to data tracked by Glassnode.\nThe number rose further to 11,056 BTC on Thursday, hitting the highest level since Dec. 31 and taking the six-day tally to nearly 35,000 BTC.\nInstitutions or large investors typically make investments through OTC desks to avoid influencing asset prices on exchanges. Thus, outflows from OTC desks are widely taken to represent institutional buying – large traders moving coins from OTC addresses to their wallets.\nThe number of daily transfers from OTC desks (outgoing transactions) rose to a record high of 245 on Thursday, marking a 10-fold rise in six days.\n\"Once again [there is] strong institutional demand,\" Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Jann Allemann said in a tweet, taking note of the spike in outgoing OTC transactions. \"Whatever bitcoin lows we will see this summer, they won't be for long. Might as well hold through.\"\nInstitutions have exhibited a strong buy-the-dip mentality this year. For example, the seven-day moving average of daily OTC desk outflows rose as the cryptocurrency suffered price pullbacks in the second half of February and after Coinbase's debut on Nasdaq.\nThe average more than doubled to over 5,000 BTC during the drop from May 12's $58,000 to $30,000.\nThe latest bargain hunting is notable as it shows large investors aren't too concerned about corporate distancing from bitcoin due to environmental concerns.\nThe market mood soured last week after Tesla, the Fortune 500 company headed by Elon Musk, suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin, citing environmental concerns. The surprise announcement came three months after Tesla announced bitcoin as a payment alternative, and weakened hopes for wider corporate adoption.\nAs such, the uptrend-fatigued market fell and witnessed the worst episode of selling since the March 2020 crash.\nWhile institutions remain bullish on the cryptocurrency, some analysts do not foresee a quick recovery.\n\"We believe that most of the leverage is out of the system now, and bitcoin should start to form a base here,\" Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk. \"However, the sharp fall – 40% between Sunday and Wednesday – has eroded confidence, and it will take some time for bitcoin to regain upward momentum.\"\nExchanges liquidated nearly $10 billion worth of derivatives positions on Wednesday, leaving the market in a much healthier state than it was a week ago.\nBalani foresees a rise to $45,000, or even $50,000, heading into the monthly options expiry due next Friday, but sees a deeper drop if support at $36,000 is breached.\n\"A conclusive break below that would signal that this correction is bigger than a short-term, bull-market pullback and all bets are off,\" Balani said.\nAlso read: Elon Musk Says Lightning Network 'Needed' to Scale Bitcoin for Now\nAt press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $41,000, still up 40% on a year-to-date basis. Technical indicators are signaling oversold conditions and scope for a bounce.\nHowever, regulation remains a critical short-term and long-term risk. \"Regulatory headwinds and global macro risk could weigh some more in the second and third quarters,\" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. \"At the same time, I think if we do see additional declines below $30,000, they will be short lived.\"",

    "summary": "Terra is becoming a persistent buyer of bitcoin, one observer said.",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain ground amid unconfirmed reports suggesting that a foundation focused on UST, the world's fourth-largest stablecoin, is accumulating the top cryptocurrency as a reserve asset.\nCoinDesk data shows that bitcoin tapped three-week highs of over $44,000 early Friday. The cryptocurrency has rallied more than 10% since the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) raised borrowing costs by 25 basis points on March 16.\nThe rumor mill is that Singapore-based nonprofit Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) purchased bitcoin worth $125 million (2,840 BTC at the current price) early this week, delivering on its month-old promise to add BTC as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin.\nStablecoin tether (USDT) worth $125 million was recently moved from a Gnosis safe address allegedly owned by Terra, perhaps evidence of the purchase, as CoinDesk's Christine Lee noted on Thursday.\nAccording to Anthony Pompliano, the popular crypto evangelist and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, the foundation has become a persistent bitcoin buyer. \"They are slowly purchasing $3 billion of bitcoin from the Luna Foundation reserves. This is being done via aggressive buying on price dips,\" Pompliano noted in blog post published on Monday.\nAccording to pseudonymous market expert and Anchor Protocol user Duo Nine, who operates the Twitter handle @DU09BTC, LFG has accumulated 18,000 bitcoin worth over $800 million.\nThe official confirmation of the said purchases is still awaited. The foundation announced the decision to build a $1 billion bitcoin reserve last month. Do Kwon, founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, recently said that the foundation has plans to increase its reserves to $3 billion, with a long-term goal of raising a $10 billion fund.\nWhile the jury remains out on the size of the foundation's recent purchases, the speculation, along with the post-Fed rally in equities, appears to be boding well for bitcoin.\n\"[There is] decent bid in crypto markets driven by excitement over institutional participation, building ETH merge narrative, and (unconfirmed) a $125 million BTC purchase by Luna Foundation Guard,\" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email early this week.\nAnalysts remain confident of the near-term prospects. \"We are at the upper band of resistance currently as BTC approached 2022 highs. With the spot flow we have been seeing, we are cautiously optimistic that there will be a continuation of the medium-term uptrend and a run to $50,000,\" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said.\nData tracked by Glassnode shows the number of coins held on centralized exchanges has dropped to 2,506,635 BTC, the lowest since September 2018. More than 7,000 coins have left exchanges in less than a week, offering bullish cues to the market.\nBitcoin was recently trading near $44,190, representing a 1% gain on the day.",

Internet Computer’s ICP token was up about 20% over the past 24 hours, and Chainlink’s LINK token was up about 4% over the same period.\nMeanwhile, technical indicators suggest a brief price bounce in BTC could occur if buyers are able to defend a daily close above $47,000.\nSome traders appear to be optimistic as leverage as open interest in the BTC perpetual futures market, a type of crypto derivative trading product, increased above November highs.\n“The boring market over the last month seems to have attracted traders back to leverage,” Arcane Research wrote in a report.\nAlso on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision by 60 days on NYDIG’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The delay contributed to a sour mood across crypto markets as some tokens experienced a brief pullback after the announcement.\nLatest Prices\nDull January ahead?\nHistorically, bitcoin tends to fall in January. The chart below shows the average monthly return in January is -3.3% over the past nine years. Over the same period, however, bitcoin registered a positive return roughly 50% of the time.\nThe probability of a positive outcome in January is mixed. That suggests some traders who are long BTC might sell ahead of volatility or may choose to accumulate on pullbacks as February shows greater odds for price gains, according to seasonal data.\nCrypto fund flows rise\nDigital asset investment products saw inflows totaling $9.3 billion in 2021, a 36% increase from 2020, according to a new report from CoinShares.\nSome investors pulled money out of crypto funds during the final week of 2021, as outflows totaled $32 million.

    "summary": "The committee wants regulations that will make the country more competitive in the crypto industry with other jurisdictions.",
    "content": "An Australian Senate committee has recommended a set of new rules to establish a clear framework for the country’s digital assets sector.\nThe committee on “Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre,” which submitted its initial report on the topic last November and a second in April this year, presented its third and final report Tuesday. The document outlines problems identified by leading industry participants and includes 12 recommendations to address the lack of crypto and blockchain regulations in the country.\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology regulation in Australia has often appeared fragmented and haphazard with decades-old laws covering the new technology.\nOne witness told the committee that taxing profits on crypto transactions as a capital gain “unavoidably complicates” the establishment of crypto projects, compared with jurisdictions like Singapore that have “favorable income tax laws and do not have CGT (capital gains tax).”\nSen. Andrew Bragg, the committee’s chairman, said Australia can be competitive in crypto.\n“Australia can be a leader in digital assets,” he said. “This means Australians can access new choices and lower prices. It means Australians can have more control of their financial destiny rather than being dependent on endless intermediation.”\nRecommendations but not yet law\nThe committee recommended implementing a new licensing regime for crypto exchanges and establishing a custody or depository regulatory framework for digital assets.\nThe committee also recommended that the Australian government set up rules for companies that have the new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure.\n“AML/CTF regulations and Financial Action Task Force guidelines need to strike a balance between appropriately managing risks, without implementing the travel rule in a way that undermines the operation of legitimate digital asset businesses,” the committee said in its report in relation to DAOs, referring to anti-money-laundering (AML) rules and countering terrorism financing (CFT). The travel rule refers to a requirement that virtual asset service providers such as crypto exchanges disclose information about their customers. The rule was established by the global Financial Action Task Force.\nThe committee also addressed the issue of “debanking,” or banks refusing their services to local crypto and remittance customers. Last month, the committee heard several complaints about that.\nThe committee is recommending the country’s Treasury lead a “policy review” of the viability of a retail central bank digital currency in the country in order to curb reliance on the private banking sector.\nThe recommendations now go to the Senate, where they will be debated until it drafts a bill. The Senate and the House of Representatives would then vote on the bill.\nTo view the full list of the committee’s recommendations, see here.\nRead more: Australia Has Third-Highest Rate of Crypto Adoption in the World: Finder Survey",

    "title": "Market Wrap: Ethereum Hard Fork Rally Outperforms Bitcoin",
    "summary": "Ether is up 3% over the past 24 hours.",
    "content": "Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was in the spotlight on Thursday as the latest hard fork upgrade, which wasa dubbed “London,” officially activated on the Ethereum blockchain network. The upgrade contributed to bullish price action as ether rose about 5% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 3% rise in bitcoin during the same period.\nDespite ETH’s rally, some analysts expect widespread institutional adoption to take a few years. Institutional interest boosted bitcoin’s investment appeal over the past year, which contributed to a crypto rally during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n“I think Ethereum might flip the bitcoin market cap in the long term, but not this year,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, said in an interview with WuBlockchain.\n“I met Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and other big institutional asset management firms in Miami a few weeks ago and they said they're still struggling explaining what Ethereum/DeFi (decentralized finance) is to their bosses,” Ju said.\nLatest prices\nCryptocurrencies:\nTraditional markets:\nMeanwhile, some institutions remain active across the crypto market either directly or indirectly. On July 22, Fidelity Investments acquired a 7.4% stake in crypto miner Marathon Digital Holdings for about $20 million.\nOn Thursday, French asset manager Melanion Capital won regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of bitcoin and several crypto-related stocks.\nAlso on Thursday, Invesco, a U.S.-based asset manager, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list an ETF with indirect exposure to bitcoin via futures and other investment vehicles.\nLarge institutions are easing into the crypto market with a bitcoin-first approach. It will likely take some time, however, before investors fully embrace altcoins such as ether as regulatory hurdles must be cleared first.\nEthereum London hard fork\nEther was initially steady after the London hard fork was activated, but it started rallying about an hour later. As of press time, ether was changing hands at around $2,807, up from about $2,600 right before the changes took effect, CoinDesk 20 data shows.\nMany crypto traders are focused on one component of the upgrade, called Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which changes the network’s fee structure so that a certain amount of the cryptocurrency’s supply will be “burned,” or removed from circulation. The bet is that the blockchain’s net issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency will slow as a result of the change, ultimately helping to set a floor under the price.\nAnalysts at Stack Funds and elsewhere have compared the London hard fork and implementation of EIP 1559 to the Bitcoin blockchain’s “halvings” that occur every four years in the sense that major changes in the cryptocurrency’s supply growth are deployed at specific moments in the blockchain’s lifecycle. Some investors believe Bitcoin’s halving events in the past have helped to increase the price of the underlying cryptocurrency.\nAs of 15:06 UTC, some 585 ETH of fees had been burned, or roughly 43% of the block rewards issued since the Ethereum hard fork took effect at data block No. 12,965,000, according to the website ultrasound.money.\nEther technicals\nEther is now above the 100-day moving average for the first time since June. The price rally has cleared a significant technical hurdle, although the price could find some resistance at the $3,000 level.\nETH’s rally has outperformed bitcoin after a few months of consolidation. The ETH/BTC ratio is testing initial resistance at 0.06, but could see further upside as momentum improves.\nBitcoin seasonality\nSimilar to stocks, bitcoin is approaching a seasonally weak period, which could encourage buyers to take profits. The table below shows, on average, relatively weak returns in August over an eight-year period. September tends to be the worst month. Buying picks up in October and February.\nSeasonal patterns can vary, especially as bitcoin departed from its historical trends when it tumbled in May.\nStablecoins as collateral\nThe margin assets for bitcoin futures trading has been shifting from bitcoin to stablecoins, according to Delphi Digital, a research company that focuses on digital assets. The shift has become especially significant as cash margined open interest soared after bitcoin’s price crashed in May.\n“The most important implication of this is that longs don’t have the added boost of holding both spot BTC and BTC futures while it goes up, but they’re no longer exposed to deeper losses when their position turns against them (because their margin is in stablecoins, not BTC),” Delphi wrote. “For shorts, they can take advantage of downtrends without their margin value eroding, but they lack protection when BTC moves up.”\nAltcoin roundup\nRelevant news:\nOther markets\nNotable winners of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):\naave (AAVE) +10.92%\nuniswap (UNI) +8.39%\nalgorand (ALGO) +2.09%\nNotable losers:\nstellar (XLM) -1.68%\nchainlink (LINK) -0.85%\ndogecoin (DOGE) -0.63%",

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is still up about 11% year to date, according to CoinDesk 20 data.\n“The primary reason for the sell-off has been the crackdown in China on mining operations and banking services,” wrote Simon Peters, analyst at multi-investment platform eToro.\nLatest prices\nCryptocurrencies:\nTraditional markets:\nRegulatory pressure from China has always been a headwind for cryptocurrencies, which is why the near-50% decline from all-time highs surprised some analysts.\n“The news out of China regarding mining and trading crypto may seem dramatic to newer investors, while those with experience should be accustomed to the progression of this news over the past several years,” wrote Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments.\nPerhaps an intensified regulatory crackdown was not fully priced in given how the price of bitcoin nearly doubled over the past year.\n“Today we polled our 950+ person community to gauge their opinion on where the bitcoin bottom may be, and we received split answers for $28,600 and $25,500,” wrote Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider Trade the Chain.\nOthers remain more optimistic about where bitcoin’s price is going. “Bitcoin is currently trading approximately one-third below its long-term exponential trend line,\" a phenomenon it has only exhibited for 20% of the time in bitcoin’s history, according to Stephen Kelso, head of markets at ITI Capital. \"Given the market forces and demand for scarcity assets to protect wealth, ITI believes this is an attractive buying opportunity for investors.\"\nFor now, $30,000 remains a key support level, although technicals show limited upside towards $34,000-$36,000.\nMicroStrategy bond stress\nMicroStrategy’s latest bond to finance the company’s additional buying of bitcoin is now trading below its face value as the cryptocurrency continues to fall in value.\nPrices on the $500 million bond, which closed on June 15, dropped almost three points after the company said on Monday it completed its purchase of 13,005 bitcoin at an average price of $37,617. Bitcoin was trading at around $32,542 as of press time.\nAt last count, MicroStrategy held 105,085 bitcoins. The company so far issued more than $1.5 billion in convertible notes and junk bonds to fund such purchases.\nDecline in active addresses\nBlockchain data shows low demand for transactions over the past few months.\n“Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced dramatic slowdowns in on-chain activity, with active addresses and total transfer volume falling back to 2020 and early 2021 levels,” wrote Glassnode in a newsletter published on Monday.\nBitcoin’s active addresses have fallen 24% from the March peak, while Ethereum’s fall in active addresses has been more extreme, dropping 30% from peak levels.\nDigital asset funds face outflows\nDigital asset investment products saw a third consecutive week of outflows, totaling $79 million for the week ending June 18. This is now the longest bear run in outflows since February 2018 when there were seven consecutive weeks of outflows, according to a report by CoinShares on Monday.\n“The focus of outflows continues to be bitcoin, which has endured its sixth consecutive week of outflows totaling $89 million,” wrote CoinShares.\nOpen interest in bitcoin futures drops\nThe total open interest in the bitcoin futures market is sitting at $11.3 billion, down 59% from its April 13 peak of $27.3 billion, according to Arcane Research.\nThe downward trading indicates institutional investors are being “cautious” at the moment, Arcane said in a report. It also notes that three-month futures in bitcoin are in \"backwardation,\" meaning they are traded at a discount to current spot prices. That is generally perceived to be a bearish signal.\nAltcoin roundup\nRelevant news\nOther Markets\nMost of digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 were lower on Tuesday.\nNotable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):\nxrp (XRP) - 13.96%\npolkadot (DOT) - 12.54%\ntezos (XTZ) -11.06%",

    "summary": "Ethereum-based assets can now natively exist on Internet Computer via the new bridge that connects the blockchains.",
    "content": "A new cross-blockchain bridge connecting the Ethereum network with Dfinity’s Internet Computer will allow ERC-20 tokens to exist natively on Dfinity’s network, developers behind the bridge said this week.\nInternet Computer is a blockchain built by the Dfinity Foundation to help facilitate a decentralized layer of web infrastructure. It is backed by prominent funds such as a16z and Polychain Capital.\nCalled Terabethia, the bridge enables cross-chain contract communication, asset mirroring and transfers across different blockchains. It is built on a forked version of Ethereum scaling tool StarkWare, and will enable contracts on both blockchains to communicate and allow anyone to mirror and use any Ethereum asset on the Internet Computer and vice versa.\nBridges allow blockchains to exchange data, tokens or smart contract instructions with each other. These operate independently of the rules or consensus mechanisms of whichever blockchains they connect.\n“Similarly to how Ethereum extended the functionality, usefulness and value of Bitcoin, we believe the Internet Computer has the potential to do the same for Ethereum assets and applications, and could even potentially become the best L2 (layer 2) for Ethereum long term,” explained Harrison Hines, founder of Psychedelic, the Web 3 development studio behind Terabethia.\nWhat the bridge does\nThe bridge comes ahead of Internet Computer’s native Ethereum integration, which will allow interoperability between the two blockchains. The integration will allow Internet Computer smart contracts to hold Ethereum assets on Ethereum and make calls to them, but won’t allow ERC-20 assets to directly exist. A bridge helps solve that problem.\nPorting assets between the Internet Computer and Ethereum can help create liquidity and complementary products for the user base of the two blockchains, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other decentralized finance (DeFi) products.\nDeFi protocols rely on smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services, such as lending, borrowing and trading, to users.\nInternet Computer started this year with a “reverse gas model” to focus on scalability. The model sees developers supply the funds needed to run the applications/contracts that use their gas – a fee paid to use a blockchain, Internet Computer in this case.\nBut the response among investors has been weak. Tokens of Internet Computer (ICP) fell 97% since their issuance in May – from $700 to Friday morning’s $21 – amid reports of alleged insider trading and large token holders exiting their positions. The tokens have a market capitalization of $5 billion as of Friday, down 72% from May′s $18 billion figure.",

    "summary": "Even the terms \"cryptocurrency\" and \"blockchain\" have a far wider meaning now than they did just a few years ago.",
    "content": "Crypto had a breakthrough 2021, and 2022 is looking equally promising.\nPrices soared and public awareness of its enormous potential widened. Digital assets are now prominent on the radars of major financial institutions and regulators.\nDuncan Trenholme is co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP. TP ICAP operates in the global wholesale over-the-counter and exchange-traded markets.\nBut as the asset class, which at one point topped $3 trillion in market capitalization, matures, the industry faces a reckoning with terminology that is ill-fitting for services that have evolved beyond those describing traditional financial systems.\nThis disconnect is detrimental for crypto’s continued development by confusing retail and institutional investors looking for clear explanations. If people are comfortable with the language of the fledgling industry, they are more likely to become participants in it. Pinpoint definitions also allow regulators to make decisions more quickly.\nYet, clarity, based on a crypto lingua franca, could do much to accelerate regulatory guidance and ensure widespread crypto adoption among investors who are not yet comfortable acquiring crypto or even investing in companies that provide services for it.\nCrypto exchanges\nFor example, many cryptocurrency exchanges have added additional services that mean they now more closely resemble a broker-dealer or a bank than a traditional exchange. This is an important distinction.\nBeyond the listing and trading services, exchanges now safekeep assets, handle client funds, act as a counterparty to trades, have their own proprietary over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk and even occasionally lend and borrow against clients' collateral.\n\"Exchange\" may often be the wrong term for this type of firm. What’s the alternative? Perhaps a hybrid encompassing the main services of these companies would be more descriptive and consumer friendly.\nCryptocurrency\nEven using the term \"cryptocurrency\" to describe the assets themselves is misleading because it fundamentally confuses the role of many tokens within their native networks and beyond. The majority of digital assets are not currencies.\nSome tokens play roles more similar to equities, representing a share of ownership. Some exist purely for liquidity provision and some act as bearer/receipt tokens on staked collateral. Tokens and digital assets have many other uses as they touch a widening number of industries. To bundle them under the term “cryptocurrency” is misleading.\nCourts will ultimately decide what rights and ownership tokens give to their holders. Perhaps industry leaders can settle on a lexicon that accounts for the distinctions of different tokens and, with time, would find widespread adoption.\nBlockchain\nEven the definition of the term \"blockchain\" is evolving. It once described an innovative technology whose practical value was difficult to define. But with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, many of them funded in the millions by a now-rapt venture capital audience, it suggests a more varied, larger-scale phenomenon.\nBlockchain projects now encompass DeFi, GameFi and the rapidly evolving metaverse. A world based partly or entirely on the smart contracts of Web 3 now seems achievable. Who could have imagined this development just a few years ago? Does blockchain now sufficiently describe this bounty of different uses?\nWho has authority?\nPerhaps most importantly, the shortcomings of current terminology are preventing regulators from reaching a consensus on categorizing tokens as securities, commodities or other financial instruments. Such clarity would enable agencies to determine which of them has authority over these assets. This task is already difficult because DeFi and other Web 3 platforms operate outside the perimeter of traditional finance.\nAs institutional interest grows in digital assets, a strong regulatory framework will be essential, but this can only occur when the nomenclature is precise.",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market is still recovering from last month’s volatile correction. Bitcoin was up about 4% over the past 24 hours as of press time and was holding support above $35,000. Technicals suggest limited upside towards $40,000 and $45,000 as resistance remains strong.\nTraders were met with a mix of good and bad news heading into June. The bad: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose last week to delay a decision on WisdomTree’s bitcoin ETF application. In late April, the SEC delayed a decision on VanEck’s bitcoin ETF application to at least June.\nDelayed approval of a bitcoin ETF could leave traders searching elsewhere for signs of a directional pull. Bitcoin, ether and other larger cryptocurrencies have been stuck in relatively tighter ranges over the past few days, but some analysts remain hopeful that bullish sentiment will return.\nBitcoin goes to Miami\nSome are looking to the Bitcoin 2021 in-person conference in Miami starting Thursday as a possible positive influence on price movement. This is similar to the so-called \"CoinDesk Consensus Effect,” an unproven theory that crypto prices typically rally during or immediately after last week's annual conference.\nMati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, calls it the “Miami Effect.”\n“The idea is that a gathering of several thousand people speed networking, sharing ideas and closing deals can be a boon for grassroots growth in the industry,” wrote Greenspan in a newsletter published on Wednesday.\nElsewhere, dogecoin (DOGE) continues to rally and is up about 20% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing.\nDogecoin howls at the moon\nThe rally in DOGE has taken center stage ever since Tuesday’s blog post by Coinbase saying traders on its Pro platform can begin trading the cryptocurrency as early as Thursday.\nDogecoin was trading at 41 cents at the time of writing, representing a 32% gain in the last 24 hours.\n“People are still going to be cautious long term, but this debut will eventually have some ability to attract traditional investors and not just the Robinhood/Reddit army,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n“We’ve had consistent net buyers on dogecoin, which indicates the general bullishness around it as it gains popularity across all demographics,” said Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich in an interview with CoinDesk.\nHowever, some analysts see lack of fundamentals as a possible deterrent to DOGE’s rally. And technicals suggest limited further upside despite the short-term bounce.\nRead the full story by CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma here.\nVolatile May leaves bitcoin rangebound\nOver the past month, bitcoin suffered its third-worst monthly loss of about -35%, leaving analysts to wonder if sellers have fully capitulated.\nLast month’s correction “performed slightly better than some of the most notable bear markets in history in 2012 and 2018, as you can see in the chart below,” wrote 21Shares, a Swiss based asset manager, in a newsletter published on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, fundamentals are improving, which suggests selling pressure could subside this month.\n“We are witnessing fundamental buying pressure from long-term investors representing more than 50% of the investor base,” wrote 21Shares.\n“Traders should look out for a confident move above $40K or a sell-off below $30K,” wrote Arcane Research in a newsletter published on Tuesday.\nBlockchain activity declines\n“Activity on the Bitcoin blockchain has declined sharply with the latest price correction, and the number of daily active addresses is now at the lowest level since November last year,” according to Arcane Research.\nHistorically, large drops in blockchain activity coincided with market tops similar to 2017 and 2019. The current drop in active bitcoin addresses suggests further downside for the cryptocurrency.\nEther is making a slight comeback\nEther has struggled to sustain moves above $2,800 over the past week as the corrective phase takes hold. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value appears to be holding support relative to bitcoin.\nETH/BTC (the price of ether in bitcoin terms), shown below, is holding above the 50-day volume weighted moving average with resistance seen around 0.08.\nOther markets\nDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher on Tuesday.

Chia creator and BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen has been saying for several years that he aims to take Chia public. In a press release, Cohen said the company “was excited to welcome such a prestigious and proven group of investors who support our mission to radically improve global financial and payments systems.”\nOn Monday, Chia said it would use the funding for hiring and to bolster its infrastructure. Hoffman fleshed out those plans, saying that the company would grow its workforce to about 75 people by year’s end, roughly triple its current size. About half that number would be engineers who would focus on making its blockchain and smart transaction platform more user friendly. The company has already hired engineers from BitTorrent, Blockstream and Dash, among other companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.\nThe remaining hires would be part of a development and “go-to-market” team that will target big banks, government agencies and other institutions. “We want to ensure that we have the development resources that are needed,” Hoffman said.\nIn what Hoffmann described as a “barbell” strategy, the company is also targeting consumers who are seeking a more efficient way to send and execute transactions, including cross-border payments.\nThe company touts its decentralized blockchain and smart transaction platform as more energy efficient than competing systems. It launched its mainnet on March 17 and began enabling transactions on May 3. Hoffmann said it now counts more than 600,000 nodes.\nCygni Capital, Slow Ventures and Naval Ravikant are among the other investors in the latest round. Richmond Global Ventures managing partner David Frazee, who invested individually in the firm, will join Chia’s board.\n“Chia redesigns Bitcoin from the ground up, taking everything that is right and addressing all its issues with energy usage, security, regulatory compliance and ease of use,” Frazee said in the press release.",

    "content": "Red Date Technology, the company developing China’s Blockchain Services Network (BSN), wants the project to move past its government roots as it pushes for international expansion in a tumultuous geopolitical climate.\nRed Date filed in late July to register a nonprofit foundation in Singapore to manage the international version of the network, CEO Yifan He told CoinDesk.\nRead more: China’s Latest Crypto Ban Is Its Most Severe, Insiders Say\nThe company hopes to bring international leaders from tech and financial services companies to the board of directors, he said.\nThe move is aimed at making the BSN into an “international standard open-source community” that, like the internet, isn’t controlled by any one entity. It might even step down from the board of the Singapore foundation at some point in the future, He said.\nWhat is it?\nThe BSN is a blockchain development platform made available through cloud-based nodes in cities in China and abroad. Developers can access more than a dozen protocols, including Tezos, Nervos, Solana, Polkadot, Hyperledger Fabric, IRISnet, Algogrand, R3′s Corda and Baidu’s Xuperchain, among others.\nRed Date’s headquarters sit on the outskirts of Beijing, in a building among countless rows of other identical office spaces. Most of its 150 employees are engineers. Nothing about the setting implies that the company is building one of China’s flagship blockchain projects. For most of its seven-year history, it wasn’t. Founded in 2014, it was working on smart-city projects with local governments in China until the BSN was begun in 2018.\nAspiring blockchain developers can buy a bundle of Blockchain-as-a-Service and cloud hosting to make decentralized applications. The bundle is cheaper and easier to deploy than most other alternatives, Red Date says.\nThe BSN also comes with interoperability protocols, enabling interconnected decentralized applications (dapps). By making this cheap connectivity-enabled blockchain platform around the world, Red Date hopes it will lead to global adoption of the technology and eventually become the de facto infrastructure for an “internet of blockchains.”\nBut the network is split into two versions to ensure compliance with Chinese authorities, who do not look favorably upon fully decentralized and permissionless chains like Ethereum and Solana.\nIn the Chinese version, permissionless chains are “adapted” into permissioned chains, thus becoming centralized and easy to control.\nRead more: China Tightens Crypto Mining Crackdown, Bans Trading\nThe international version currently operates eight nodes in eight locations using Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft Cloud servers. South Korea is the latest country to get its own BSN portal earlier in September.\nCEO He declined to disclose data on the platform’s uptake internationally.\nThe origins\nAs the BSN seeks to attract developers to the platform, its Chinese origins are coming under scrutiny. One of the key questions is who is really in charge, according to Paul Triolo, head of geo-tech risk consulting at Washington, D.C.-based Eurasia Group.\nTriolo argues that if the project is perceived as an attempt by the Chinese government to control blockchain development, it will likely fail to attract developers from around the world.\n“The idea of a global blockchain internet is really interesting,” Triolo said, but the question is how to do this “in a way that wouldn’t be seen as a Chinese government alternative.”\nRead more: Inside China’s Effort to Create a Blockchain It Can Control\nThe BSN Development Association, the committee that oversees the network’s buildout, is chaired by the State Information Center, a think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s highest economic planning body. Other founding members include state-owned telcos such as China Mobile and China Unicom, as well as payments provider China UnionPay.\nGiven this origin story, questions about the BSN’s independence from government interference have emerged. Splitting the network in two, and trying to onboard other entities to run the international version, could help position the network as a more neutral platform, at least in theory.",

    "summary": "Among the initial steps will be legislation to recognize stablecoins as legitimate vehicles for payments.",
    "content": "The U.K. government on Monday announced a series of initiatives toward its goal of making the country a global center for crypto technology and investments.\n“The measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said in a press release.\nOne of the first steps will be to bring stablecoins into the U.K. payments system, according to Sunak’s statement and to comments made by John Glen, a minister of state at the Treasury, at the Global Finance Summit.\n\"This will enable consumers to use stablecoin payment services with confidence,” Glen said. “The government will introduce this legislation as part of an ambition to deliver a world-leading regulatory regime for stablecoins.\"\nRead more: The UK Wants to Regulate Crypto: Here's What That Could Look Like\nIn 2019, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the U.K.'s financial regulator, published a report on crypto that said that crypto firms with digital assets for cross-border payments could be subject to payments services regulations but that the tokens themselves wouldn’t be regulated.\nTaxes\nMeanwhile, the Treasury is looking to engage closely with the public on changes it wants to make to the tax system. \"We don't think the tax code will need major surgery to make it work more easily for crypto,\" Glen said.\n“The U.K. is also playing a leading role in negotiations on the new tax reporting framework to enhance tax transparency and consumer confidence while enabling a level playing field in tax reporting globally,” he added.\nAdditionally, the U.K. Treasury will aim to resolve specific issues like the treatment of decentralized finance loans and staking. Plus, it will amend the investment manager exemption to remove any stipulations that discourage U.K. fund managers from including crypto assets in their portfolios.\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) haven't escaped U.K. regulator scrutiny. The Treasury asked the Law Commission, an independent body tasked with making sure laws in England and Wales are fair, to consider the legal status of DAOs. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization or company that is usually governed by a native crypto token, with anyone holding the tokens able to vote on important company decisions.\nThe crypto regime\nIn addition to the stablecoin legislation, the Treasury is marching on with broader plans to set up a “world-leading regime … [facilitating] safe and sustainable and I hope, rapid innovation,” Glen said.\nThe government will form a industry group called the \"Crypto Asset Engagement Group\" to help guide the next steps in regulation. The chairman of that group will be at the ministerial level, and the group will include senior representatives from the FCA, Bank of England and businesses, Glen said. It will meet up to eight times a year.\nThere are also plans for legislation establishing a financial market infrastructure, or “sandbox,” that will enable firms to test distributed ledger technology.\nMeanwhile, the FCA will hold a two-day \"CryptoSprint\" in May, where it will seek views from the industry on issues related to developing crypto regulations.\nAn NFT?\nAs icing on the cake, Glen said, the U.K. government has asked The Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token (NFT) that will be issued during the summer as “an emblem of the forward-looking approach we are determined to take.”\nCORRECTION (April 5, 08:13 UTC): Corrects Glen's title, removes extraneous full stop in third paragraph; adds dropped word in 11th. Removes \"and enable\" from 12th.",

    "title": "Why Investors Have Been Slow to Trust Security Tokens",
    "summary": "Blockchain concepts such as digital wallets and smart contracts are not easily understood among traditional investors and regulators. That's where education comes in.",
    "content": "Security tokens, seemingly poised for a comeback several months ago, have not been accepted by the wider investment community as quickly as some might have hoped.\nBlockchain concepts such as digital wallets and smart contracts are not easily understood among traditional investors and regulators. Also, there has been a lack of trust regarding the quality of offerings on security token platforms.\nSecurity tokens represent ownership shares in a company that does business using blockchain technology.\nU.S. regulators have already provided a framework that would allow private companies to bypass traditional initial public offerings (IPO) and use blockchain technology to digitize the capital-raising process. Companies such as tZERO, Securitize, and Texture Capital, for instance, facilitate the trading of tokenized securities, catering to a sophisticated investor base.\nBut educating the public about security tokens, and being transparent about offerings, has taken more time than expected.\n\"The security token space has been slower to adopt [by investors] than previously thought,\" Scott Harrigan, CEO of Securitize Markets, said during an interview with CoinDesk. The company launched its digital marketplace last year.\nThere is the potential for widespread adoption. Goldman Sachs has noted the efficiencies provided by security tokens for issuing digital debt. State Street wrote that \"all financial markets will have to digitize their processes and tokenize their assets to remain relevant\" in a December article.\n“Investors are judging unique offerings based on the expected return on investment,” said Dave Hendricks, CEO of Vertalo, an Austin, Texas-based startup that helps issue and manage digital securities. But company \"founders decided that issuing a security token would attract a class of investors that were more interested in how the security was formatted rather than the underlying quality of the offering.”\nUnlocking private capital\nSome issuers and investors are showing growing interest in the security token space.\nA report last month by Arca Labs showed that 71% of 100 financial service professionals surveyed in July were interested in investing in digital asset securities, and they believed that most securities would be digitized and settled on a blockchain in the next five to 10 years.\nA majority of investors, especially individuals, have been locked out of participating in early-stage deals despite the flood of new capital in private markets versus public markets. Most secondary market transactions are handled by private equity funds with long holding periods.\nTheoretically, tokenizing securities could make it easier for retail investors to access and trade private offerings.\nGaining the trust of family offices, wealth managers and other accredited investors hasn't come easy.\nMarketplaces need to grow demand and expand quickly, according to Richard Johnson, CEO of Texture Capital. \"There's been some educational requirements for investors, and some weariness. There needs to be good deals,\" Johnson said during an interview with CoinDesk.\nBlockchain-based alternative trading systems (ATS) provide greater transparency, increased speed and lower transaction costs, according to industry heads. The goal of security tokens is to make illiquid assets liquid, which requires a large pool of buyers and sellers that can easily trade on a digital exchange.\nGaining the trust of all stakeholders\nThe security token industry has been advocating for greater adoption through various events. \"Momentum is picking up,\" Harrigan said during a Jan. 27 digital asset security event hosted by Arca Labs. \"We're starting to see more trust in the system, which is key to liquidity.\"\n\"We recently launched two index funds with S&P, and we're seeing larger institutions take advantage of that. The biggest appeal is holding assets in digital wallets, which opens up the investor base,\" Harrigan said.\nExperts on the panel also noted that regulators are more engaged in the security token industry despite onerous registration and compliance hurdles. Alternative trading systems have existed for securities for decades, Alex Vlastakis, president at tZERO ATS, said during the panel.\n\"What's new and exciting is the innovation around trading and clearing of securities\" with blockchain technology, Vlastakis said.\nBut not everyone is convinced. \"It has become unclear as to what purpose or what efficiencies security tokens would offer to the global securities marketplace,\" New York City law firm PKA Law stated in a February 2020 letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on behalf of a client.\n\"It seems likely that the introduction and use of 'Security Tokens' will create undue burden on market participants, exchanges, custodians, clearing firms, retail and institutional investors,\" PKA Law stated.\nImproving the security clearing process\nExperts say regulators have not fully embraced the blockchain.\nFor example, despite recent improvements to the ATS settlement process, some digital security custodians are still required to maintain traditional book entries despite having an automated transparent record of ownership recorded on the blockchain.\nRegulatory updates have allowed an ATS to \"directly convey settlement instructions to custodians on behalf of customers, which is a critical step in moving digital asset securities to a more mainstream securities trading process,\" Sean Bowden, CEO of Symbridge Capital, said during the panel. The company plans to launch a digital asset exchange later this year and is talking to potential issuers.\n\"As the industry evolves, we look forward to ultimately getting on-chain settlement,\" Bowden said.\nThe compliance process can be cumbersome. It took 18 months for Texture Capital to receive regulatory approval versus the traditional five- to 12-month period for U.S. broker dealers.\nFirms competing for a spot in the emerging arena are focused on attracting large-sized quality offerings in real estate, mining, sports leagues, and businesses who want to tokenize employee ownership.\n\"We're building a new market structure from scratch, but we need to reach critical mass to boost liquidity,\" Richard Johnson, CEO of Texture Capital said.",

    "content": "Bitcoin inflows to cryptocurrency exchanges surged on Monday by the most in 15 months, blockchain data shows, in what might be a sign of more retail traders looking to liquidate their holdings in a falling market.\nCrypto exchanges registered a net inflow of 30,749.89 BTC on Monday, according to the data provider Glassnode. That was the biggest single-day tally since March 12, 2020, when the bitcoin price tanked by 40% amid coronavirus-induced panic selling in the global financial markets – earning the date the moniker of \"Black Thursday.\"\nInvestors typically transfer bitcoins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings. On Black Thursday, for example, exchanges witnessed a net influx of over 40,000 BTC.\nBitcoin fell to $42,102 on Monday, extending the preceding week's 20% decline and hitting the lowest level since Feb. 8, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The sell-off gathered steam over the weekend with some Twitter users suggesting that the U.S. electric car maker Tesla may be selling its bitcoin holdings.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk clarified early Monday that the company has not sold any coins. So far, however, Musk's declaration has failed to lift the cryptocurrency beyond $45,000.\nWhile net inflows spiked on Monday, the majority of the action was concentrated mainly on Binance, a preferred venue for retail investors, as per Glassnode. Meanwhile, the U.S. exchange Coinbase continued to register bitcoin outflows, potentially indicating persistent demand from institutional investors looking to buy the price dip.\n\"Coinbase has seen almost entirely net outflows of BTC since breaking last cycles $20,000 all-time high, a trend that has continued this week,\" Glassnode said in the weekly newsletter published on Monday. \"Coinbase is the preferred venue for U.S. institutional accumulation, and given the scale of typical daily withdrawals (10,000 to 20,000 per day), it suggests that larger buyers remain in active accumulation during this correction.\"\nWhile Binance received more than 80% (or 26,000 BTC) of the total net inflow of 30,749.89 BTC on Monday, the U.S.-based Coinbase registered a net outflow of 146 BTC.\nThe two exchanges have seen diverging trends in net flows in recent weeks. The balance held on Coinbase has declined by 34,408 BTC since April 19. Meanwhile, the amount held on Binance has increased by 95,397 during the four weeks.\nThe magnitude of the net bitcoin flows on Binance has picked up sharply in recent months in a sign of \"volatility in Binance user macro sentiment,\" as noted by Glassnode.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Chart Indicator Suggests Worst of Pullback May Be Over\n\"This provides further indication that the recent inflows are likely to be driven by both new market entrants (panic sellers) and potentially due to capital rotation into other crypto assets,\" Glassnode's weekly newsletter said. For example, some investors could be transferring bitcoin to Binance to snap up alternative cryptocurrencies.\nThat said, inflows do not imply immediate liquidation, just traders getting into position to make a quick sale, and it's hard to gauge how many of the coins were already liquidated, partly due to limitations on the data.\nThere's also the possibility that some of those traders may hold out for higher bitcoin prices.",

    "summary": "On-chain metrics like the “paper hands” ratio from Glassnode suggest a bottom could be nearing, one analyst said.",
    "content": "Bitcoin, the crypto market leader, could be in for a recovery rally, as retail interest declines, analysts told CoinDesk.\n“Whilst bitcoin remains flat in the short term, on-chain metrics like the paper hands ratio from Glassnode suggest a bottom could be nearing,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, told CoinDesk in an email.\nThe BTC paper hands ratio is the ratio of young coins active in the last six months to the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. A high reading represents greed among retail or short-term traders, while a low number signals retail disinterest.\nRetail investors are often referred to as having paper hands – weak capacity or desire to hold an asset for a long time – and are usually the last to enter the bull run and exit the bear run. Hence, declining retail activity is considered a contrary indicator – a hint of an impending reversal higher.\n“If this ratio gives a high reading, it suggests retail greed, but if it is low, it suggests the market is at retail capitulation,” Sotiriou said. “We are at 24.5% currently, the lowest level since the 2015 bear market. Every time the ratio has reached around 25% previously, it has sparked a multiyear bull market with incredible gains, which indicates that this fearful period could be a great buying opportunity based on historical data.”\nFurther, the prevalent cautious mood in the derivatives market may portend a move higher. “The neutral to slightly below neutral funding rates seen recently suggest that a short squeeze is a plausible scenario,” according to Arcane Research’s weekly note published on Tuesday.\nFunding rates refer to the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures perpetuals market. The mechanism helps keep the price of perpetuals or futures with no expiry tethered to the spot price. Positive funding rates mean longs are paying shorts, while negative rates mean the opposite.\nSince early December, the number of open positions on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and open interest, has increased from 190,000 BTC to 258,000 BTC. Meanwhile, funding rates have been consistently neutral to negative, meaning investors have been predominantly holding shorts despite bitcoin’s downside momentum running out of steam and the cryptocurrency consolidating in the range of $45,400-$52,100.\nA cautious or bearish mood after notable sell-off and consolidation often leads to short squeeze and corrective rallies. Costs associated with holding shorts become an issue for the bears once the market stops falling, thus forcing them to unwind their bearish bets. However, a squeeze higher may remain elusive if the macro picture turns bleak, as discussed here.\nBitcoin was last seen trading near $46,750, representing a 2% gain on the day.",

    "summary": "Thanks to the transparency of Bitcoin, we can watch along as LFG moves UST towards a bitcoin-backed existence.",
    "content": "It was recently announced that the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit organization focused on the Terra blockchain protocol, might purchase $10 billion or more of bitcoin (BTC) to act as a reserve for the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin. While the specifics on how the BTC will be wrapped for use by the protocol are still in the works, thanks to the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain we can see just how much bitcoin LFG has purchased.\nHere’s how to monitor Luna Foundation Guard’s BTC purchases\nCoinDesk has confirmed that the LFG’s bitcoin address is bc1q9d4ywgfnd8h43da5tpcxcn6ajv590cg6d3tg6axemvljvt2k76zs50tv4q.\nThe actions of the address – such as purchases or transfers – can be viewed using a block explorer or a full node. OKLink, a blockchain explorer, has also tagged the address as LFG’s. More conveniently, there is a Twitter bot that tracks the balance of the LFG wallet. As a result, we can track LFG’s progress as it builds up its bitcoin reserve.\nAs of writing, LFG is in the process of raising $3 billion, most of which has already been raised, to buy bitcoin and has purchased almost 28,000 bitcoin, worth ~$1.3 billion. Given the indication that LFG intends to hold more than $10 billion in bitcoin, there is more purchasing that LFG needs to do. Absent any large moves in BTC price, that could mean ~180,000 bitcoin of purchase volume in the coming months. Given there is more than $20 billion of bitcoin trading volume each day and that LFG has made most of its purchases in ~$125 million lots, it won’t have any issues filling its purchase orders.\nStill, this is a meaningful slug of purchase demand.\nWhat this could mean\nBitcoin has always been a permissionless, decentralized network that powers a fully transparent asset. So, if successful, UST could become a dollar stablecoin backed by a fully transparent asset. Right now, collateralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by dollars in reserve, but the amount of backing is only verified by accounting firms’ assurances. A dollar stablecoin with provable reserves might be seen by some analysts as an improvement on the current collateralized stablecoins where users need to trust, rather than verify, assets in reserve.\nRead more: Just as Hal Finney Predicted, Bitcoin Is Being Purchased to Act as a Reserve Currency\nThis could be an important development for stablecoins. Stablecoin trading pairs – say, UST for ether (ETH) – make up a significant majority of crypto trading volume and, beyond that, they have potential payment use cases. As the economy, crypto or otherwise, increases dependence on stablecoins, the reliability of their peg becomes paramount. An important stablecoin project moving to a bitcoin backing could prove a useful development in the journey for fiat-pegged digital cash.",

    "summary": "Until recently, the manipulable “market cap” was nearly all investors had to go on when measuring the relative value of digital assets. More sophisticated yardsticks are emerging.",
    "content": "Pop quiz: If Bank of America stock is trading at $39, and Wells Fargo’s shares are changing hands at $47, which one is cheaper?\nIf you automatically answered “duh, B of A, it has a lower price,” without asking for more information, please do not start buying cryptocurrency. (Or stocks.)\nAs sophisticated investors – who make up the majority of this newsletter’s readers – know, determining the relative value of different assets isn’t as simple as comparing their prices. To suss out whether B of A is really a bargain compared with Wells, you would probably start by considering their prices in light of the companies’ profits.\nAccording to Bloomberg data, at the Thursday closing levels quoted above, B of A had a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.66, a tad higher than 12.48 for Wells, suggesting that the market values them roughly the same.\nAnother tried-and-true measure of relative value is how a company’s stock price compares to the sum of its assets minus its liabilities. By this measure, B of A has a price-to-book value ratio of 1.3, slightly above the 1.1 for Wells.\nAgain, the above is probably old hat for most “Crypto Long & Short” subscribers. But if you find it too abstract, consider this: Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime weighed 230 pounds. That does not mean he was “fatter” than John Belushi at 222 pounds. For a more meaningful comparison, you would have to divide weight by height (body mass index), or ignore the scale altogether and measure the circumference of their forearms, wrists, hips and waists (body fat percentage). Or, you know, just look at the two of them side by side.\nWhat I’m getting at is that numbers in a vacuum don’t tell you much without context.\nA big challenge for investors in cryptocurrency is that the market has only started to develop anything like a P/E ratio for comparing the relative valuation of different digital assets. For most of this asset class’s history, market capitalization, a classic yardstick from the equity market awkwardly applied to a whole new type of instrument, was nearly all investors had to go on.\nAs CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael J. Casey has noted, market cap is subject to manipulation and, more distressingly, it implies that crypto – ostensibly an improvement over legacy money – is simply a means to get rich in dollars, encouraging shameless promotion over dutiful programming.\nDog days\nA few months ago, when the markets were getting hot, I started to worry that new retail investors were succumbing to \"unit bias\" – for example, thinking, \"Well, if dogecoin is trading in cents compared to tens of thousands of dollars for BTC, DOGE must be cheaper.\" Old hands in this sector knew that BTC had way more computing power securing its network (hashrate) and that its software had been maintained much more assiduously than dogecoin’s (development activity), not to mention that bitcoin had been around longer and had a larger community of users (network effect).\nAll of these factors went a long way toward supporting the price gulf between the mother of all cryptocurrencies and its third-generation canine copy. But I knew no shorthand vocabulary to express this – no simple gauge that might have dissuaded hapless newcomers from risking their life savings on an asset propelled mainly by memes and celebrity endorsements.\nAt first, I thought, why not take a page from the equity analysts and talk about price/hashrate? I asked around and there were (at least) two valid objections.\nOne, dogecoin uses a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt) than bitcoin (SHA-256). But perhaps more importantly, as Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter pointed out in an episode of his podcast, bitcoin’s hashrate is so much higher than that of any other coin that uses the proof-of-work consensus model that any incremental decrease in bitcoin’s hashrate or incremental increase in another network’s hashrate makes scant difference.\nO.K., so scrap that proposal. But what about development activity? Why not divide the price by the number of commits or code changes logged on GitHub? Surely, that would illuminate that not all coins were created equal, right?\nWrong. For one thing, a price-to-GitHub commits ratio could easily be gamed – for example, by someone making lots of inconsequential updates on GitHub just to fool those looking at the metric into buying the asset. Even in the absence of such manipulation, the ratio might understate the extent of a coin's development, if a major protocol upgrade were represented on GitHub by a single commit.\nChris Burniske and Jack Tatar were way ahead of me on this. “While developer activity is incredibly important, it is also notoriously hard to quantify with accuracy,” they wrote in their 2018 book “Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor’ Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,” which I dusted off while writing this essay.\nThrowing more cold water on my midwitted idea, they note, “Sometimes more contributions can be a negative factor if it was associated with a major bug being found in the software and developers rushing to fix it.”\nNew metrics\nFortunately, people far smarter than I am had similar instincts and have come up with more sophisticated yardsticks for valuation of different digital assets.\nA few years back, an outfit called CryptoCompare created code repository points, which measure development activity by the number of stars (GitHub’s equivalent of bookmarks or Twitter likes), forks (splinter projects) and subscribers who follow a project. Accounting for the fact that bitcoin has been around much longer than its competitors, Burniske and Tatar noted in their book that on a per-day basis, BTC and ETH boasted significantly more code repository points than dash, XRP or XMR did.\nWhich raises an interesting chicken-or-egg question: Were BTC and ETH (which at the time had market caps in the billions of dollars) more valuable than the other three (in the hundreds of millions) because they had more development activity, or vice versa?\nBurniske and Tatar also divided network values by cumulative repository points, and, believe it or not, found that dash had the richest valuation by this measure, at $500,000 per point (ether and BTC, in that order, were close behind). It’s certainly a different perspective than crude market caps would give you.\nOf course, three years ago might as well have been the Middle Ages in crypto. More recently, a handsome website called Token Terminal has been leveraging the wealth of public on-chain data to compare the profitability of different cryptocurrency protocols, with terminology clearly inspired by traditional financial metrics.\nThis is most intuitive with decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, which, unlike earlier generations of cryptocurrencies, have obvious revenue streams for their holders, such as the interest earned for lending assets to a liquidity pool. Hence, Token Terminal publishes good ol’ P/E ratios for DeFi projects such as Compound and MakerDAO – though not, understandably, for BTC.\n“Traditional allocators can actually get a concept of how DeFi trading will be done, just because we can adapt traditional fundamental analysis to this space,” said Kevin Kang, founding principal at BKCoin Capital, a digital asset hedge fund. “But when it comes to currencies, it’s very tricky.”\nYet, even for BTC, Token Terminal will give you a price/sales ratio. Wait, sales? What “sales”?\nAccording to Token Terminal, this is market cap divided by annualized revenue, where revenue is the total fees paid by a network’s users – which in Bitcoin consists of the (nominally optional) fees users pay to entice miners to include their transactions in a block. The firm frames that as a way to compare early-stage protocols, however.\n“The P/S ratio is meant to be used as a metric that measures how much there is usage relative to the market cap of the application or blockchain,” said Henri Hyvärinen, co-founder and CEO of Token Terminal.\nBucketing the blockchains\nThe fact that Token Terminal can calculate P/E for some protocols and not others, I think, gets at the heart of the matter.\nJust because Coin A and Coin B both run on a blockchain does not necessarily mean you can compare them on an apples-to-apples basis. Depending on the functionality of the blockchain, the most important metric for valuation will differ.\nIf you’re comparing proof-of-work blockchains, you’d look at hashing power; if you’re comparing proof-of-stake systems, you’d consider annualized interest.\nIf you’re evaluating a cryptocurrency as a store of value, as BTC has arguably become, the inflation rate, or dare I say, stock-to-flow might be the salient figure. For application-focused chains, yield may be the important metric.\nInstead of asking how we can value digital assets relative to each other, maybe we need to start with a more nuanced definition of how to value digital assets within the same bucket and go from there.",

    "content": "Today’s investors have proven that sustainability and social impact factor highly in their decision making. In 2020, environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) funds surpassed the $1 trillion mark for the first time, accelerated in part by a growing social and political awareness throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\nThere’s a natural intersection between impact investing and blockchain – ask anyone with personal stake in the space. Investors, executives and developers alike are known for having visionary goals that could potentially lead to both profit and social good.\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nThis article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.\nWhile things are still nascent, blockchain professionals argue the future use cases of blockchain technology could solve every kind of problem from government corruption to wealth inequality.\nI’ve spoken to a few founders and thought leaders about how their decentralized projects could bring about positive social impact, from altruism to intellectual property and data security.\nInterestingly, each of these areas could also potentially address wealth inequality – if executed correctly – by unlocking access to wealth for marginalized people through crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nGamifying and promoting altruism\nThe founder and CEO of the nonprofit NFT platform Leyline, Jeremy Dela Rosa, plans on creating opportunities for gamers in developing economies to earn crypto and grow wealth through video games. He also plans on making altruism profitable through NFT prizes, rewards and virtual social currency.\n“Play is just so fundamental to who we are as humans,” Dela Rosa tells CoinDesk. “But the way our economic system has been designed, it’s incentivizing the wrong things.”\nDela Rosa, who spent 10 years working at Blizzard Entertainment before founding Leyline, believes the way to motivate altruistic behavior in the “real” world outside of video games is to gamify it. His team plans on coding an open-source decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that rewards Proof-of-Good (PoG) points, which users can store in a virtual backpack. For gamers, these PoG points will be able to unlock special rewards and powers within their virtual worlds.\n“It’s really about aligning incentives towards the things that are valuable for humanity,” Dela Rosa says.\nProtecting intellectual property\nNFTs are popular among artists for their potential to revolutionize intellectual property ownership.\n“Gaming companies make millions of dollars off of dances,” says former “America’s Got Talent” contestant Snap Boogie, the CEO and founder of Beauty in the Streets, which partnered with the blockchain platform Enjin earlier this year to tokenize the dance move “Speedy Walkovers.”\nIt may seem abstract to turn a dance move into an NFT, but gaming companies are already capturing dance moves they see in street performances and on TV, recreating them without attribution using digital sensors in motion studios, then translating them to the screen to be bought and sold as in-game purchases for popular games like Fortnite.\nTurning a dance move into an NFT helps prevent game companies and motion capture studios from using tokenized motions without first purchasing the token from the artist. Blockchain’s open-source transparency could potentially mean that all transactions live on a digital ledger that links dance moves to their creators.\nThese potential intellectual property protections could apply to nearly every creative industry – not just dance. SX Noir, a thought leader at the intersection of sex tech and the metaverse, believes NFTs present a long-awaited opportunity for adult performers to have full ownership over their labor and content.\n“Sex workers have often been the scapegoats,” she explains, citing a 2020 move by major credit card issuers Visa, Mastercard, and Discover to block financial transactions on a popular adult video website when the site went under investigation.\n“It was devastating,” she says. “There were a lot of performers who were left hungry.”\nMeanwhile, so-called tube sites are known for aggregating adult video content without permission, exposing performers’ intellectual property to millions for free consumption.\nWhile the guidelines for intellectual property and NFTs are still in their infancy, the digitally scarce form of a crypto token presents some possible solutions about which artists and creatives alike are excited.\nBolstering data security\nEveryone who uses Instagram knows the power of user data. We’ve gotten used to seeing customized ads designed by algorithms to know our intimate preferences.\nBut blockchain enthusiasts say that’s Web 2 – an era in which the internet we know and love is owned by a handful of not-so-transparent corporations. (Google and Facebook, to name a few.)\nWeb 3 data will still have ads, but user data will be decentralized and run predominantly on blockchain – at least if data security company Snickerdoodle has its way. The indelible nature of blockchain could give everyday internet users a chance to give big companies a taste of their own medicine by charging them for access to their user history (for once).\n“At Snickerdoodle, we think that self-sovereignty of data is of the utmost importance and will redefine a new social contract,” says CEO and co-founder Jonathan Padilla. “People conceive of Web 3 as a chance to restart both the internet and traditional financial systems.”\nThe long-term applications of Snickerdoodle’s vision parallels Andrew Yang’s concept of a “Freedom Dividend” or universal basic income (UBI). Except funding won’t necessarily have to be raised through taxes, according to Padilla.\n“We think if we get our data models correct, we can have a private sector-based UBI,” he explains. “It can be done using blockchain-based tools to empower individuals, especially in emerging markets where that value can go a lot further, to have a passive source of income. And at the same time, that income can be applied for economic development, mobility. So that’s an incredibly powerful thing.”\nBottom line\nFor advisors, learning about up-and-coming blockchain projects is the decentralized equivalent to researching individual stocks. Buying into blockchain projects won’t make sense for every individual investor, but those with the appropriate risk appetite and robust enough portfolios may find themselves gravitating towards purchasing utility tokens for projects they care about as a way to diversify.\nSuch utility tokens are somewhat of a gamble because they involve speculating as to which projects are here to stay. They’re effectively a vote of confidence, backed by money, for the blockchain startups in which your clients are interested. But they could also pay off monetarily. Utility tokens are issued on the same blockchain upon which the larger product is built, and they can often be used later as a currency or as a way to obtain services.\nAs financial advisor and Onramp Invest CEO Tyrone Ross put it in a recent “On Purpose” podcast episode, the old financial playbook is out the window. Whereas before an investor or advisor could rely on traditional research methods like technical analysis, reading the news and pulling up a company’s public financial statements to research prospective investments, researching blockchain companies requires knowing an entirely new landscape.",

    "title": "Why Blockchain Benefits the Supply Chain",
    "summary": "Supply chains depend on clear communications, which is often missing from non-blockchain systems.",
    "content": "Supply chains are having a moment.\nMany of the world’s most successful systems and products are invisible, but it’s no surprise that supply chains are suddenly being noticed – not because of their immense success, but because they have been taken for granted for a long time and are presently congested.\nPaul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.\nSupply chains run on information. Much of the information is pretty bad – think of supply chains as a game of long-distance telephone where messages from the first participant end up badly garbled by the end. Without blockchain technology to ensure the message is clear throughout the ecosystem, we have learned to live with these big information gaps.\nRecent supply chain history\nSupply chains started to be widely digitized in the 1970s with the arrival of manufacturing requirement planning (MRP). MRP systems took a bill of materials (BOM), expanded it into constituent parts and then helped companies place automated orders.\nOn the foundation of MRP planning, companies added demand forecasting and constraint management. In theory, the flow of goods at the front of the supply chain, the retail store, affects the entire supply chain all the way to the securing of the most basic raw materials. In reality, data and technology gaps and competitive concerns interfere with much of that flow.\nIn a normal year, these gaps aren’t too visible because so much of what happens is predictable: Christmas comes every December, which reliably follows Black Monday after Thanksgiving. The supply chain gears up to address these yearly surges in activity. But recently, nothing about demand has been predictable.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brutally exposed the weaknesses in many supply chains. A supplier missing a shipment, for example, typically ignites a cascade of bad events that can turn a small shortfall into a planet-wide production crisis.\nThe smart planning systems upon which companies rely will downgrade the supplier, leading them to order more in expectation of more missed shipments. After ordering all other supplies, the inventory costs to these firms of holding so much material are high. So these organizations often will try to find missing materials on spot markets to finish their production runs.\nRead More: Sustainable Supply Chain Technology Company Circulor Closes $14M Funding Round\nSuppliers may encounter multiple buyers who, fearing shortages, will suddenly increase their orders. Many suppliers will then promise to allocate pro-rata shares to customers, incentivizing them to order more than they need. Meanwhile, if there is a spot market for a constrained product and demand increases because of smaller availability, spot prices will skyrocket.\nThis cycle, known as the “bullwhip effect” is one of the first things that supply chain professors teach new students. Ironically, although everyone in the supply chain business knows exactly what is happening, they do it anyway because not doing so would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Just like the doomed participants in the prisoner’s dilemma – game theory describing situations in which individuals make decisions that are not in the best interest of a group – the best choice for each firm does not lead to ideal results overall.\nThe power of blockchain\nBlockchain technology’s biggest benefit to the supply chain is its ability to connect companies without giving one company a competitive advantage. Blockchains also support the compatibility of tokens between locations, which means that not only will more information flow across a network but it is likely to be more accurate.\nWhen you move digital tokens that represent an asset from one location to another, you must remove the tokens from the original location to put them into the new one. This sounds simple, and it’s exactly what banks do with money. But it’s not standard procedure in supply chain interactions between companies.\nThe pandemic has exposed the big myth of supply chain management: that the information used for most planning is accurate.\nIt isn’t.\nThe only fix for this weakness is to embrace blockchains that provide end-to-end consistency and compatibility. Blockchains can clear up the confusion inherent in supply chains, ensuring the smooth, efficient delivery of goods.\nThe views reflected in this article are the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.",

The intraday sell-off occurred after the U.S. Federal Reserve pointed to a possible interest rate hike in March, which is sooner than many had expected.\nBut despite the price dip, some analysts expect BTC will stabilize in a range of between $40,000 and $50,000, which could keep volatility low.\nOthers are looking to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as ETH, LINK, ICP, FTM that have outperformed BTC over the past week.\nFor example, some decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens that fell out of favor in early 2021 still managed to retain some top spots in terms of total value locked, which represents the number of assets that are staked in a protocol.\n“Perhaps as they are considered more battle-tested and a safer store of capital compared to newer competitors,” Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.\nFor now, even with altcoins in the spotlight, volatility has declined in both BTC and ETH recently.\n“Our view is that this volatility compression is structural and will be a theme for 2022,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement. “With that said, we think this dip in the front-end [of the volatility curve] is overextended and we’re adding long gamma here.”\nTraders are “long gamma profit” when the underlying asset moves more than expected.\nLatest Prices\nBitcoin dominance declines\nThe bitcoin dominance ratio, or the measure of BTC’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, continued to decline toward 39% on Wednesday. The ratio is at the lowest level since April 2018, when cryptocurrencies were in a bear market.\nTypically, during periods of market panic, some traders would sell altcoins, which are deemed to be risky. The remaining option for traders is to seek relative safety in BTC, which results in a higher bitcoin dominance ratio.\nThis time, however, altcoins continue to outperform bitcoin, which suggests investor appetite for risk remains strong.\nEthereum’s market cap getting closer to bitcoin’s\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is roughly 50% away from overtaking bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency.\nSome analysts refer to the battle for crypto’s top crown as “The Flippening.” Over the past year, ether has gained ground versus bitcoin across several metrics, including active addresses, Google search interest and transaction counts.\nThe rise in ether’s market capitalization suggests investors are looking for potential opportunities for return beyond bitcoin.\n“There are hard dates and a hard outline from the Ethereum Foundation to increase the network throughput and lower transaction fees,” Katie Talati, head of research for crypto and blockchain asset management firm Arca, said during an interview on CoinDesk’s “First Mover” show.\nEthereum’s network improvements could be a catalyst to attract more funds to ether versus bitcoin, according to Talati.\nAltcoin roundup\nRelevant News\nOther markets\nMost digital assets in the CoinDesk 20 ended the day lower.\nLargest winners:\nLargest losers:\nSector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive, and standardized classification system for digital assets.

Bitcoin rallied nearly 40% in October, hitting a record high of $66,975.\nAnalysts at JPMorgan have attributed the rally to the perception that bitcoin is an inflation hedge contrary. The perception stems from bitcoin’s mining reward halving. This programmed code reduces the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years, putting the cryptocurrency’s monetary policy at odds with the Federal Reserve’s decades of money printing.\nHowever, bitcoin needs to expand its footprint into crypto sub-sectors like Web 3 and decentralized finance to remain relevant relative to ether in the long run, according to Chainalysis.\n“Bitcoin usage has not reached the sophistication of Ethereum or other layer 1 assets,” Chainalysis said. “A decentralized way of wrapping bitcoin is needed to unlock the use of bitcoin as high-quality capital in DeFi.”\n“If bitcoin can be used as capital in Web 3.0 then it will have a future as both a scarce fungible asset and as a useful asset in the more innovative side of crypto,” Chainalysis added.\nThe uptick in whale holdings suggests the recent rally is backed by strong hands and is sustainable. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum lost steam in the first quarter as whale holdings started declining. The market crashed in May.\nThe cryptocurrency was last changing hands near $62,900, representing a 0.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Eyes Fed Meeting After Biggest Monthly Price Gain Since December 2020",

    "content": "For its investors, Red Date was an acquired taste.\nWith fewer than 200 employees, mostly engineers, Beijing-based Red Date Technology is building the Blockchain Services Network, an architecture that it hopes will be the underlying infrastructure for a new blockchain-based internet.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.\nThe project has attracted controversy due to its potentially global implications and close ties to the Chinese government (which frowns on cryptocurrency but loves it some blockchains). The company and its investors insist it is taking concrete steps to ensure that the globally available version of the BSN is free from potential interference.\nIn June, Red Date announced a $30 million Series A round led by early-stage venture capital firm Kenetic Capital and Prosperity7, the diversified venture fund of state oil giant Saudi Aramco. Bangkok Bank and Swiss financial services giant Pictet Group also participated in the round.\nGlobal investors over the last half decade have been looking for ways to profit from China’s robust economic growth (recent worries about the country’s property sector notwithstanding). But putting money to work there presents challenges, not least of all when both technology and the government are involved.\n“There’s a lot of things we had to get comfortable with, with regards to where it [the BSN] originated. Is there going to be a back door? What is Red Date’s role?” Joe Chang, managing director at Prosperity7 in China, told CoinDesk.\nThe BSN is backed by Chinese government-adjacent entities, including the State Information Administration Center, state-owned telecom China Mobile, payments provider China UnionPay and the National Reform and Development Commission, China’s macroeconomic planning institution under its cabinet.\nOver a six-month period, the Aramco fund had “a chance to look under the hood and really understand what it was all about,” Chang said, a process that convinced the team to invest in the company.\nBangkok Bank and Pictet Group declined to comment for this story.\nTranscending politics\nMuch like the internet itself, the BSN is different in China and abroad. The network is split into two, a Chinese and an international version. The Chinese version doesn’t allow for completely decentralized protocols, or public chains. The BSN instead adapts public chains into so-called “open-permissioned” blockchains.\nRed Date is setting up a foundation in Singapore that will manage the international version of the network, CEO Yifan He told CoinDesk. It plans to bring representatives from global tech and financial companies to sit on the board, he said. The company also wants to eventually open source the technology of BSN International, He said.\nJehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic Capital, said he hopes the network will eventually “transcend any single player” to be truly communally managed by stakeholders. If so, Red Date would go down in the network’s history as “a footnote.”\nKenetic was also a seed investor in derivatives exchange FTX’s token; OpenOcean, an aggregator that compares platforms to find the best yields for crypto lenders; and Compass Mining.\nConvinced as they are by Red Date’s intentions, the investors acknowledge the geopolitical risk but said it’s not a dealbreaker.\nGiven today’s politics, BSN International’s vision “may be overshadowed by special interests and political agendas,” Chu said.\nChang agreed there are geopolitical sensitivities associated with the network, but argued they stem from perceptions rather than facts.\nUltimately, the investors said they see the BSN as the new internet. Chang compared it to Amazon Web Services for blockchain with the added benefit of interoperability, while Chu emphasized its capacity for connecting private and public chains.\n“Red Date is either going to be a $100 billion company or it’s going to be a zero,” Chu said.\nCORRECTION (SEPT 28, 3:37 UTC) Corrects company name and details about FTX investment.",

    "title": "NFTs Are Coming to India's Flourishing Art Market",
    "summary": "Auction houses are struggling to cater to India’s growing appetite for art. With 624 million internet users in India, NFTs could be the perfect disruptor.",
    "content": "The arts sector has visibly struggled during the coronavirus pandemic. A study by Art Basel and UBS found that public auction sales have fallen by an average of 30% over the past year. The impact has in part been offset by a forced transformation as some auctioneers and galleries, turned reluctant disruptors, moved to engage patrons through digital platforms.\nThe recent interest in NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in the art market must then come as a relief to some within an industry struggling to find success online. The news of an NFT auction, where a work by digital artist Beeple sold for a cool $69 million to an Indian-origin entrepreneur by a major auction house, was widely touted as a breakthrough in digital art. Since then, further NFT sales hosted by the biggest global auction houses have continued to see significant demand.\nMany are already predicting an upending of the centuries’ old art market, expecting patrons to eschew traditional auction houses and instead choose to buy digital art through decentralized marketplaces. Some critics disagree: They argue that NFTs are simply the newest bubble in an industry characterized by pump-and-dump cycles of speculation, claiming that many of the digital art world’s newest patrons seek nothing more than a get-rich scheme from flipping acquired NFT works.\nClaims that the art world is about to see a reckoning do seem dubious. Yet, at the same time, arguments that suggest NFTs are nothing more than a passing fad are equally facile. The fundamental concept and technology behind NFTs hold promise. They are likely to shape the creation of a new market within the arts sector and bring new innovations.\nHow are NFTs valuable in the arts space?\nNFTs are not a new concept in the blockchain world. They have been around for several years now, finding popularity within the gaming market and as fan collectibles, with more than one grown adult going into meltdown while attempting to acquire families of digital cats.\nHowever, as an increasingly popular class of digital assets, NFTs can also be used as digital certificates to represent provable ownership of art, recorded and easily verified using a blockchain. The represented artworks are typically digital, as has been the case with many of the high-profile NFT sales, but may even be physical, such as a painting or a sculpture, twinned to its digital record through an electronic tag (a QR code, for example).\nThe value of NFTs comes from the ease with which they can be traded, causing a number of highly liquid exchanges for digital art to appear. With improved user experiences and better supporting infrastructure, NFT art will likely continue to gain legitimacy as a new innovation in the art market. The rise of NFTs has gone hand in hand with the growth of digital technology that enable their popularity. Decentralized auction houses are emerging to cater to new marketplaces for digital art. New layers of sophistication are gradually emerging from the convergence of NFT markets with decentralized finance.\nThe result is a tranche of new, increasingly elegant instruments designed to drive greater access and funding, enabling fractional ownership, collateralized lending and index trackers for NFT markets. As such, it is possible that NFTs – and tokenized assets more broadly – could offer new ways to finance creativity and improve access for artists and buyers alike.\nAn opportunity for India\nWhile India represents around a 7% share of the global economy in terms of gross domestic product, its art market is comparatively small. In 2018, India accounted for just 1% of world imports in art, compared with China’s share of 9%. Yet, despite its relatively small footprint, and with the exception of the pandemic, the Indian art market has been booming. Annual auction revenue in 2018 grew by a remarkable 29% from the previous year, outpacing almost every other market in Asia.\nAuction houses are struggling to cater to India’s growing appetite for art, with just 7% of works in 2018 going unsold (compared with a global average of 30%). Demand for art is soaring, and auctioneers, the traditional \"middlemen\" between artists and patrons, are fast becoming a bottleneck. Proponents hope NFT marketplaces will emerge as an alternative, offering India’s 624 million internet users a new medium to buy and sell digital art.\nSuccess could open up access to a diverse range of grassroots artists from across India. It is not so ridiculous to imagine digital works developed in Bengal’s Kalighat style of folk art, for example. Indian artists might instantly be empowered to offer their works to a global audience and gain access to new means of financing for further development.\nIn a country where many artists lack access to sufficient funding, the impact of that could be profound. Not only could it make art a viable profession for millions of aspiring artists, it could also unlock new art forms by financing creativity and re-invigorating fading traditions.\nThe most obvious challenge is legal. NFT marketplaces are predominantly developed on the Ethereum blockchain, and the largest depend on ether as the main currency for buying and selling artworks. Cryptocurrencies face legal and regulatory uncertainty in India. It is still unclear whether authorities will attempt to ban them again. NFTs themselves have no legal basis in India today and therefore may also come under scrutiny from regulators.\nSimilarly, copyright protections may not cover the exchange of NFT-backed digital artworks. Such issues restrict access and constrain adoption. The government plans to introduce a cryptocurrency bill outlining its position later this year. Crypto advocates are sanguine. They argue that the government has hinted at a softening stance and is considering regulating digital assets instead of proscribing them.\nMore complex still is the matter of digitizing India’s art market. For example, putting up NFT-backed works may be simple for a digital artist based in a tech hub like Bangalore, but less feasible for a folk painter based in, say, Bikaner. Over time, access will improve. Art collectives, charities and private galleries may be able to help bring more artists online, widening the reach and quality of India’s digital art.\nThey might expect disruption, but India’s auction houses are unlikely to see NFTs as a threat. Rightly so. Three of the world’s largest auction houses have been quick to recognize an opportunity to expand to new business models and new customers by auctioning NFTs on their platforms or forging new partnerships with NFT marketplaces. Established art houses potentially stand to gain from this kind of collaboration. India’s art establishment should take note.",

Sweden, whose Riksbank is also toying with digitizing its national currency, uses the e-krona.\nEarlier this year, the Banque de France published a request for proposals for central bank digital currency (CBDC) “experiment” applications in a bid to help it understand the risks and mechanisms of CBDCs.

    "content": "Rapid growth for blockchain-enabled play-to-earn game Axie Infinity came to a screeching halt in September, with revenue sliding by 40% from August, the first month-over-month decline for the company since January.\nThe monster-battling game that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reward players made 64,933.71 ether (ETH), worth $220.32 million, in September, down from a record $342 million in August, data center Axie World shows. While September’s figure represents a nearly 3,000-fold year-over-year growth, it’s only about 10% of the pace of the month before.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nAmong blockchain-based applications, Axie’s monthly revenue was second only to Ethereum’s $830 million, according to data provided by Token Terminal. The popularity of the play-to-earn economy is evident from the fact that Axie Infinity earned significantly more revenue than decentralized finance (DeFi) heavyweights like Aave, Compound, Curve and SushiSwap.\nLaunched by Sky Mavis in 2018, Axie infinity came into the limelight in the early third quarter as yield compression in bitcoin and DeFi drove hot money into gaming and NFTs.\nThe game has become a significant source of income in countries like Brazil, the Philippines, Venezuela and Vietnam. It’s become so popular in the Philippines, that the government has expressed its intention to tax Axie players.\nAxie allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as “axies,” which are digitized as their own NFTs. The game has two utility tokens, smooth love potions (SLPs) and axie infinity shards (AXS), which can be easily converted to cash.\nBreeding fees accounted for nearly 90% of the income in September, while the rest was earned from marketplace fees.\nThe AXS token was trading near $78 at press time, up over 14,000% on a year-to-date basis, according to TradingView data. Prices reached a high of $95 in early September before retreating with the broader crypto market in the wake of China’s blanket ban on virtual currency businesses.\n“China’s crypto ban resulted in some downside for the token, but that was largely due to the high correlation nature of digital assets,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said in a LinkedIn post. “The underlying fundamentals remain very much intact, and demand for AXS and its ‘play-to-earn’ model will likely accelerate going forward.”",

The cyberattack contributed to a sour mood across the crypto market.\nBTC and ETH options strategy\nBullish sentiment is rising in the options market for bitcoin and ether. “There's been a spike in demand for near-term options as BTC and ETH obliterated their multi-month price ranges,'' Delphi Digital tweeted. “Both assets seem to be in a strong uptrend, and speculators have been buying short-term options.”\nThe chart below shows the declining 25 delta skew for one-week BTC and ETH option contracts, which means there is more demand for calls than for puts.\nSome traders see an opportunity to short BTC and ETH volatility given the recent activity in the options market. The chart below shows the recent rise in BTC three-month and six-month at-the-money volatility.\n“We maintain our short volatility view. In fact, vega (longer dated puts and calls) looks like a good sell at these elevated levels,” QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.\nQCP said that the frenzied buying of calls in both BTC and ETH across the volatility curve led to the short-squeeze rally. “We think this flow comes from funds and large speculators making large topside bets, buying BTC strikes up to $80K to $100k and ETH strikes up to $8K to $10K from as early as September 2021 out to June 2022,” QCP wrote.\nLarge bitcoin transactions\nBitcoin’s blockchain transaction volume with values of at least $1 million has risen 10% since the beginning of August and accounts for nearly 70% of the total value transferred.\nThese larger investors, as represented by large-value dollar transactions, fueled bitcoin’s nearly 20% price gains since last week, Glassnode said.\nA number of analysts say the trend shows that these institutions are focusing more on the cryptocurrency’s upside than on potential obstacles, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen wrote.\nBlockchain spending behavior\nThe \"spent output profit ratio,\" or SOPR, which is calculated by dividing the realized value of a spent output by the value at creation of the original unspent transaction output, has broken above 1.0, reached a local high, and then reset back to 1.0, after months trading below 1.0, according to Glassnode. The movement indicates \"a textbook bullish reversal,\" Glassnode said.\nAn SOPR value above 1 “implies that the coins moved that day are, on average, selling at a profit (price sold is greater than the price paid)\" and vice versa.\n“Most important to watch is whether SOPR holds above 1.0,” Glassnode wrote. “Should SOPR continue to trade higher, this reflects a bullish scenario where the market is adequately absorbing profits realized on spent coins. If, on the other hand, SOPR falls and trades back below 1.0 on a sustained basis, it would suggest a general weakness in the market and potentially a fake-out rally.”\nAltcoin roundup\nRelevant news:\nOther markets\nMost digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up higher on Tuesday.\nNotable winners of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):\ncardano (ADA) +7.01%\nthe graph (GRT) +5.84%\nuniswap (UNI) +3.4%\nNotable losers\ndogecoin (DOGE) -1.93%\nlitecoin (LTC) -1.75%\nfilecoin (FIL) -0.71%",

The aim of this series is to provide a deep dive for financial advisors to further our understanding of this space and create a bridge that we can use efficiently to merge the TradFi world we work in with the new and innovative DeFi space that is being created.\nThis article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.\nThe origins of Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem\nIn 2013, programmer Vitalik Buterin co-created Ethereum as an additional cryptocurrency project after his work on Bitcoin. Ethereum is different from Bitcoin because it’s designed to be a blockchain with multiple different functions: to be a digital money, to be used for global payments and to have blockchain applications run on top of its code. There’s currently an entire digital economy running on top of Ethereum, one of which is the DeFi ecosystem.\nDeFi is a crypto movement that is built on cryptocurrencies like ether, open to anyone in the world (with an internet connection). DeFi is a trustless application, meaning the applications are not controlled or hosted by a central party such as a bank or a government. The aspects of cryptocurrency such as cryptography, smart contracts and blockchain technology allow this system of decentralized finance to exist for the global community to utilize.\nEthereum utilizes a robust smart contract programming language called Solidity, which allows for all of the necessary logic that financial contracts require to be included in the application code. Many other cryptocurrencies now compete with Ethereum to run DeFi applications, such as Avalanche, Terra, Fantom and others, but it is important to note that Ethereum is the largest network and was the first project that was used to create DeFi.\nThe first DeFi project, MakerDAO, was created in 2015 on top of the Ethereum blockchain. MakerDAO allows any user to lock ether, or ETH, via smart contracts and generate dai, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Dai is often used in the MakerDAO savings platform called Oasis, effectively creating a decentralized bank. Through the power of stablecoins and smart contracts, Oasis created a lending and borrowing platform for its users.\nLending and borrowing in the DeFi ecosystem\nLending and borrowing platforms have become a tremendous part of the DeFi ecosystem. Users are able to lock crypto positions into a smart contract and borrow against their position. Other users are able to lock crypto positions into a smart contract and generate yield by allowing their coins to be lent out to borrowers.\nAn interesting thing to note is the yields generated by lenders in the DeFi ecosystem are substantially higher than the traditional financial system. Running a smart contract is much more cost-effective than running a traditional bank; therefore, nearly all of the yield generated from lending money is passed directly back to the lender via the smart contract. Many people place their trust in these transparent smart contracts and are able to generate a significant income from their utilization.\nIn a world of ultra-low interest rates, the cost-effective smart contracts are providing a technological solution to this problem. Many people are upset with central bankers for allowing interest rates to be so low, and a solution isn’t found by political persuasion but rather through technology, which has yet again created an opportunity for borrowers and savers alike. Perhaps it would be wise to hedge your bets on the traditional banking system through building a robust DeFi portfolio.\nCompound\nCompound, an autonomous algorithmic protocol that allows users to supply various crypto assets and start generating interest, is another large application in the lending and borrowing category of DeFi. Its native cryptocurrency is COMP. There is currently $8.9 billion locked into Compound contracts (according to DeFi Pulse). Compound also allows its users to borrow against crypto positions such as ETH and borrow stablecoins (with interest) used for spending. This is very similar to the traditional finance concept of borrowing dollars against an appreciated security. Anyone can lock assets into the Compound protocol and immediately begin earning continuously compounding interest on their position.\nUnlike traditional banks, Compound interest rates adjust automatically depending on supply and demand. When a user supplies tokens to the Compound protocol, they are credited with cTokens, representations of underlying assets that are generating interest and that are acting as collateral. Compound users are able to borrow up to 50% of their cToken value. Just like traditional financial systems, there are liquidation points on the borrowed position. Users have immediate liquidity and can withdraw their assets at any time.\nAave and flash loans\nAnother large lending and borrowing platform in the DeFi ecosystem is Aave. Similarly to Compound, Aave is a decentralized, open-source, non-custodial protocol running on Ethereum. Its native cryptocurrency is AAVE. There is currently $11.8 billion locked in Aave smart contracts. Aave allows users to lend or borrow crypto assets. Lenders are able to earn a yield on their assets that are supplied to the protocol. Like Compound, the earned yield adjusts depending on supply and demand of the market.\nAave also offers a unique service called “flash loans.” Flash loans are “one block borrow transactions,” which are transactions in which a user borrows and repays a loan in the same block. The smart contract only allows the loan to occur if the borrow and repayment of the loan occurs in the same block (transaction). This technology is a new feature that is used in arbitrage and quick trading. This type of loan does not exist in traditional finance and is seen as a major improvement to the TradFi system.\nFlash loans enable cross-exchange arbitrage to exist in the crypto ecosystem, as detailed in this CoinDesk explainer: “Traders can make money by looking for price discrepancies across a number of different exchanges. Say two markets are pricing pizzacoin differently. It’s priced at $1 on Exchange A and $2 on Exchange B. A user can use a flash loan and call a separate smart contract to buy 100 pizzacoins for $100 at Exchange A, then sell them for $200 at Exchange B. The borrower then repays the loan and pockets the difference.” Thus, flash loans increase price stability across cryptocurrency exchanges and ultimately strengthen the crypto economy.\nDecentralized exchanges\nThe creation of smart contracts, stablecoins and lending and borrowing platforms, led to another important creation in DeFi: decentralized exchanges (DEX), another incredibly important component of decentralized finance. DEXs saw over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2021. In my next article in this series, we will go through the creation of DEXs, their value to the crypto economy, how they interact with lending and borrowing platforms, and how users benefit from their existence.\nWhy DeFi is so important\nThe goal of DeFi is to create an open financial market that is trustless and permissionless. Significant development and investment has been placed into the advancement of DeFi, and as financial advisors, it’s important to understand this space. Much of the technology in the DeFi space builds upon, and improves, the TradFi system, possibly resulting in a better outcome for users – you and your clients. As the space continues to evolve and strengthen, it’s vitally important to have an understanding of decentralized finance and to be prepared to interact with, and rely upon, these applications.",

    "title": "As Crypto Bulls And Bears Abound, Who Should You Believe?",
    "summary": "Many crypto critics and enthusiasts are focused on cryptocurrencies as investible asset classes. Yet the true staying power of digital assets is in the growth and potential of their underlying technology.",
    "content": "Every time the zeal for digital assets from crypto enthusiasts crescendos, so does the derision from crypto critics.\nRecently, as bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds made their debuts in the U.S. and the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value leaped above $65,000, a world-renowned economist and a star bond fund manager took to social media and the airwaves to voice their concerns about digital assets.\nThis article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.\nIn the first case, economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb likened the rise of bitcoin to the 17th-century Dutch tulip bubble. For those unfamiliar with that, in the 1600s, the Dutch went wild for unusual and rare variants of the tulip, paying exorbitant prices for some varieties before the bubble popped and the market collapsed. Taleb is implying the same thing may happen to the cryptocurrency.\nIn the second, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Global, declared most cryptocurrencies as “garbage” and said that most digital tokens will fade away or end disastrously, like the dot-com sector did when the bubble of the 1990s finally burst at the end of the decade.\nTo me, both of those criticisms seem to amount to the same argument, with two different outcomes: Cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. Taleb believes that a crash is imminent and that tokens won’t be able to recover their value, while Minerd believes that most tokens will end up in the dustbin of history, but that some coins – bitcoin in particular – will survive.\nTime will tell whether either pundit is right, but it’s hard for me to imagine a multitrillion dollar asset class and the influential technology behind it just disappearing if and when a valuation bubble pops.\nEnthusiasts and skeptics take sides\nSince the advent of bitcoin, crypto skeptics and enthusiasts have lined up to voice their opinions about the long-term prospects for the digital assets market.\nThe enthusiast side includes people like billionaire Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz and the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini Exchange, but those people obviously have skin in the game. More interesting is the enthusiasm that comes from people such as noted financial advisor Ric Edelman and Tesla founder Elon Musk, as they aren’t crypto “natives” and they bring energy and attention to digital assets from other industries.\nMeanwhile, skeptics include Berkshire Hathaway’s legendary tandem of Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, economist Paul Krugman, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, as well as financial advisor icons Peter Mallouk and Michael Kitces. And another skeptic, speaking of financial icons, is Carl Icahn.\nEven more interesting is the recent string of crypto converts – people who started out as skeptics but have changed their minds on digital assets. These include economic historian Niall Ferguson, journalist Kevin Roose and a host of Wall Street legends such as Ray Dalio, Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones.\nWhat the skeptics, including Taleb and Minerd, believe is that one, the public zeal for digital assets will at some point drop, and two, that the volatility of assets like bitcoin will help accelerate their undoing.\nThat may be a myopic viewpoint, because it focuses on the utility of digital assets as investments alone. It’s like looking at a stock market as merely a mechanism for registering public opinion on the names and tickers of the companies themselves, completely agnostic to the underlying earnings, cash flow and growth.\nBeyond digital assets as investments alone\nSteve Larsen – founder of both PlannerDao, a source of digital assets information and infrastructure for financial advisors, and the Certified Digital Assets Advisor (CDAA) designation – argues that many advisors are missing the point when it comes to viewing and understanding digital assets. Larsen is a former Edward Jones advisor and an accountant who founded the CDAA as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Unlike the CFP Board (Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards) and the Investments and Wealth Institute, which are both central governing bodies that manage certifications, the CDAA is governed by advisors who vote on requirements and policies as a community.\n“Digital assets will revolutionize not just investing, but the economy, as well,” said Larsen. “Step one is understanding cryptocurrencies and other digital asset as an asset class and how they fit into a portfolio. Step two, which is coming much faster than most people realize, is that cryptocurrency is also a delivery system that will on some level forever change how we access financial products and services.”\nThe first place that has come to light is the advent of decentralized savings and payments platforms, and it will spread to investment accounts and the financial and technological infrastructure that advisors rely on to work on behalf of their clients, Larsen said.\nChanging technology and public discourse\nThe first wave of change from blockchain technology has targeted banks, and one of the next waves will target traditional broker-dealers and custodians. Because digital assets are designed to be assets investors can hold themselves, Larsen argues that the underlying technology could one day render broker-dealers and custodians obsolete, replaced by algorithms operating at little or no cost to the advisor or end investor.\n“Advice is a product that never goes out of style; it’s a service that’s always needed, but the product distribution system we are traditionally forced to deal with is going away,” he said. “Digital assets will cut out many of the layers of middlemen that it has traditionally taken to invest client money, and that’s who is really going to miss out, not the planner on the front end.”\nUntil that shift happens, though, the public discourse on cryptocurrencies will continue to be over their utility as an investible asset class, Larsen said, which means we will have to live with the push and pull between skeptics and enthusiasts, bulls and bears.\n“There’s a reason we’re all trying to get over and through any intermediate time frame, because that’s what it is going to take before people can clearly see the utility digital assets will bring to their day-to-day lives,” Larsen said.\n“It is like the internet. Conceptually, it all made sense, but it didn’t really come together until people saw the difference in their lives. That’s holding digital assets back from the true explosion a lot of us are waiting for, and part of that explosion can’t happen until independent advisors feel like they can bring their clients to crypto in a safe and legal way.”",

    "content": "Blockchain infrastructure provider InfStones, which aims to serve as a flexible Amazon Web Services–like platform for Web 3 development, has closed a $33 million Series B funding round from a group of investors that included Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and Dragonfly Capital. No valuation was provided, with the round bringing the company’s total funding up to $45 million.\nOther investors in the round included Qiming Venture Partners, DHVC, A&T and Value Internet Fund.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nFounded in 2018 with offices in Beijing, the United States and Canada, InfStones plans to use the funding to expand operations in Asia, Europe and South America. The company will also triple its team from 30 to 90 employees over the next year, and expand support to more than 100 blockchains and protocols, up from more than 50 currently.\nInfStones has been profitable since 2018, CEO Zhenwu Shi told CoinDesk in an interview. The purpose of the fundraising is to build out the ecosystem and network of collaborators. Current InfStones customers include crypto exchange Binance and analytics firm Dune Analytics.\nThe InfStones platform provides easy access to protocol consensus and proof-of-stake staking benefits. Users can run validator nodes, access on-chain data and build decentralized applications across multiple chains. The platform-as-a-service supports tens of thousands of nodes on blockchains including BNB Chain, Cardano, Chainlink, Ethereum, Polkadot, Polygon and Solana.\n“A lot of blockchains want to become more decentralized, which requires more people to launch a node in their ecosystem. But those people don’t have a technology background and don’t know how to maintain those nodes,” said Shi. “Using our product, they can very easily launch and participate in the blockchain network.”\nRead more: Blockchain Startup InfStones Raises $10M in Series A Funding Round\nInfStones has also launched a new front-end user interface that lets clients easily deploy nodes within minutes. The public application programming interface (API) can deploy nodes for BNB Chain, BSC Archival Data, Ethereum, and NEO with support for Cosmos and other chains coming soon.\n“Just as AWS has made it easy for companies to deploy applications across servers, storage, and databases, InfStones is making it simple to deploy nodes, APIs, and other services,” said Dragonfly Capital Partner Tom Schmidt in a press release. “Their platform helps reduce the barriers to entry for new companies that are looking to incorporate blockchain technology into their stack.”\nOther firms vying for the same crown are also raising lofty sums. Both Blockdaemon and Alchemy have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in recent weeks.",

    "title": "BSN’s Red Date Behind Shenzhen-Singapore Trade Blockchain Project",
    "summary": "The network could help companies and governments implement data security laws.",
    "content": "Singapore and China’s Silicon Valley, the city of Shenzhen, are building what is likely the world’s first blockchain-based network for a cross-border trade data exchange between two major economies.\nRed Date Technology, the architect of China’s internet of blockchains, is working under a smart city MoU between the Shenzhen Municipal Government and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to build the blockchain-based Transnational Trade Network (BTTN), Red Date CEO Yifan He told CoinDesk.\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nUsing the BTTN, companies will be able to transfer trade data between countries and firms, while adhering to local data privacy and security laws, according to a white paper shared with CoinDesk.\nThe project is another example of how Chinese companies, with Red Date in the lead, are working to make their closed technology information system interoperable with the rest of the world’s open protocols.\nMuch like with the Blockchain Services Network (BSN), Red Date envisions the BTTN as a fundamental piece of the future global blockchain architecture. The BTTN could expand into “a multilateral network” that will “comply with data laws in any jurisdiction and support information security in any cross-border trade scenario,” the white paper said.\nThe data cooperation project comes as China implements draconian data security and privacy laws. The Data Security Law, which came into force in September, has reportedly hampered the ability of Chinese companies to share data with overseas partners and customers.\nBased in Beijing, Red Date has been branching out after the BSN, a platform where developers can build and deploy blockchain decentralized applications, caught headlines around the world.\nThe BSN has the backing of two state-owned telecoms, China Mobile and China Unicom; payments provider China UnionPay; and the State Information Center, a think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planning agency.\nHow does it work?\nThe current systems companies use to share data during cross-border trade are disjointed. In the CoinDesk interview, He brought up the example of bills of lading (BoL). Every country or even port has its own system for keeping track of BoLs, and so a cargo ship traveling across borders will need to connect to multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) to submit the documents.\nRead More: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision\nThe BTTN wants to solve that problem by connecting trade partners on a private network of “data highways,” so that they only have to connect to the network, He said.\nThe BTTN is made up of data centers that can be set up by installing the BTTN software on a cloud server. These are connected via blockchain-based data highways, called business chains.\nData center operators are responsible for network membership, security and compliance. That is different from the BSN where the consortium of companies pitching into its development, the Development Alliance, manages the data centers, He explained.\nFirms can exchange data across jurisdictions by plugging into the data centers and then using the business chains. The chains can be built on different blockchains, both permissioned and permissionless, such as Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum.\nThe network offers system-level services as secure document transfer via IMDA-developed blockchain tool TradeTrust, decentralized identity verification and decentralized data storage to support the data exchange.\nThe China dimension\nJust like with the BSN, Chinese companies won't have access to permissionless chains, which allow anyone to join, to comply with Chinese regulations. Using the BSN’s interoperability technology, the BTTN will allow for permissioned and permissionless chains to interact.\nChinese data centers, like the one in Shenzhen, will host “a corresponding permissioned system-level chain for each public chain,” the white paper said. One such chain is dubbed the “Ethereum Access Chain.” With that, Chinese firms will be able to pay for gas in fiat currencies, while a permissioned chain records data to comply with Chinese law, the paper said.\nThese built-in cross-chain capabilities ensure that regardless of how or where individual businesses build their networks on the BTTN, they can continue to transact with others globally in compliance with local regulations.\nOne of the key goals of the proof-of-concept stage is compliance with the Data Security Law, He said. At present, authorities have “no idea how to control” Chinese IT systems that connect with global systems for trade, the CEO said.\nThe BTTN data centers can work as gateways through which data passes to go overseas, making it possible for the government to easily assess whether a firm is compliant with Chinese data regulations. “Without this type of highway, everybody can connect to wherever they want to connect to. There is no way to even manage that,” He said.\nGiven these monitoring capabilities, He expects provincial branches of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s highest internet regulation body, to set up BTTN data centers.\nRed Date is talking with three different provincial CAC branches, including those in Chongqing and Hainan, He said.\nNext steps\nThe infrastructure is based on the existing BSN architecture, and Red Date has already started charging data center operators, He told CoinDesk.\nThe transaction goes through China Mobile, and the BTTN technology is sold as a China Mobile product that uses Red Date technology, He said. This makes it easier to work with government clients in China, he said.\nIn its initial phase, Southern Electronic Ports, a branch of China’s electronic port system, will set up a data center in Shenzhen and BlockAsset Management will set one up in Singapore, which will integrate with the IMDA-operated TradeTrust system.\nThe China Center for Urban Development, a branch of the NDRC, Tencent’s licensed neobank WeBank, logistics supplier LinkLogis, and GovTech Singapore are also participating in the project.\nRead more: China’s BSN Builder Is Registering a Nonprofit in Singapore to Manage International Arm\nUPDATE (Jan. 19, 8:33 UTC): Adds MoU in second paragraph.",

    "summary": "Previous episode of speculative frenzy in SHIB paved the way for a 90% price crash.",
    "content": "Speculative fervor in popular meme token shiba inu (SHIB) recently reached unprecedented levels, reprising the retail frenzy observed ahead of May’s price crash.\nThe number of addresses that acquired the cryptocurrency within 20% of the all-time high price climbed sixfold to a record 116,560 in the eight days to Nov. 2, amounting to 12% of the total count of non-zero addresses, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.\nThe spike in so-called “All Time Highers” addresses tracked by IntoTheBlock indicates a rush to buy the cryptocurrency near the lifetime price high – a sign of fear of missing out (FOMO) among traders. FOMO is often observed in the last leg of the bull markets.\n“Last time this pattern emerged in shiba inu in May, SHIB dropped by 90%,” IntoTheBlock said in its weekly newsletter published Sunday.\nThat said, past performance is no guarantee of future action. As the old saying goes, markets can stay irrational longer than sellers can stay solvent.\nSo SHIB’s record number of all-time highs doesn’t imply a crash is imminent. However, it does serve as a fairly accurate indicator of the degree of speculative action taking place, as IntoTheBlock noted. Savvy investors typically reduce long exposure whenever signs of retail FOMO emerge.\nThe self-proclaimed dogecoin killer fell 15% last week, ending a five-week rally that saw prices rise nearly 10-fold to $0.00008870. At press time, the cryptocurrency was changing hands near a descending trendline resistance at $0.00005785.",

    "summary": "Blockchain promises an immutable history of on-chain data. But the “ledger of record” is merely a new way to manufacture consent.",
    "content": "Blockchain promises an immutable history of on-chain data. But the “ledger of record” is merely the newest version of an old trick – the manufacture and distribution of certainty.\nThis pattern of manufacturing certainty (laying claim to truth) and then distributing it (demanding conformity) I call the “certainty-industrial complex,” and it has always been fundamental to maintaining social order.\nFor thousands of years, organized religions have laid claim to absolute truth and then demanded conformity from the people. Today, mainstream scientific culture expresses similar confidence and demands similar conformity, shaming heretics. The certainty-industrial complex even shaped most of our childhoods, as public education frames teachers as authorities and requires students to conform.\nIn all cases, the implication is clear: You are dependent on an authority for the truth. Your only hope of knowledge is to stop thinking and start obeying.\nGiven that certainty is the most resolutely nonexistent thing in the universe (see Heisenberg, Godel, Wittgenstein, et cetera.), its manufacture and distribution has traditionally required a lot of lying.\n“Bitcoin is dead.” Uh-huh.\n“It’s just the flu.” Uh-huh.\nIn the coming years, decentralized oracles will cryptographically verify a wide variety of data points and save them on-chain, creating “definitive truth” – a ledger of record.\nWhile the intent is noble, the execution is merely the next evolutionary step of the certainty-industrial complex – an innovation in obedience mongering. The ledger of record lays claim to the truth, and you must conform.\nIronically, technologists like Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and billionaire investor Mark Cuban fail to grasp what the internet means for public discourse: Access to facts is not the problem anymore – trusting their interpretation is. The bulletproof certainties blockchain provides don’t make it safe to start trusting institutions again. A central authority – like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the New York Times – can still impose an accepted interpretation of the facts, even if the facts themselves are available for everyone to view.\nMoral Kombat\nThe internet revealed that behind every authority is a choice between authorities.\nHaving a choice between authorities means authoritative certainty is now a mere data point for our own uncertainty, our own judgments.\nThe internet cemented free choice about whom we trust as the decisive factor in whether we agree with a given narrative.\nThis new freedom kills the certainty-industrial complex.\nIt’s dead.\nAnd there’s no going back.\nA town called Panic\nThe certainty-industrial complex knows something is different, but it doesn’t know what. The tactics of manufacturing and distributing certainty have simply stopped working. The old authorities gasp for a breath of their former stature, feebly flashing credentials at the incredulous throng.\nLedger of record advocates believe that by manufacturing certainty at a level of purity unseen in human history, the ledger will make certainty effective again – that soon we’ll live in a world where authorities say, “look, it’s on-chain!” and everyone will agree and live happily ever after.\nThey’re wrong – and there’s proof.\nFact consensus =/= narrative consensus\nEven if we assume for practical purposes that facts exist, consensus on facts does not produce consensus on narratives.\nSocial media feeds are a perfect example. When Donald Trump tweeted on Nov. 16, 2020 “I WON THE ELECTION,” 80 million people would agree on the literal text content.\nBut what it means – what story it tells about the world we live in – remains the subject of endless debate. While the Associated Press called the American presidential election for Joe Biden, skeptics, frustrated by court-demonstrated Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) collusion with the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and years of corporate media censorship, remained distrustful.\nPublic discourse is divided by interpretations of data, not data itself. Cryptographically verified data doesn’t even touch this problem.\nConsider The DAO hack of 2016. How did the Ethereum Core team respond? Depending on who you ask, they rolled back the chain, intervened in-state, performed a hard fork, et cetera. Yet, all the relevant data is on-chain – shouldn’t we all agree on what happened if it’s all on-chain?\nAdvocates trumpet the ledger of record as the savior of public discourse, but we’ve already seen cryptographically verified data fail to produce a cryptographically unified narrative – even after five years, with a technically sophisticated audience.\nThe DAO hack is proof it doesn’t matter how justified one person’s certainty may be; convincing others of that certainty is an entirely different problem.\nDue diligence\nBefore reconstituting all of humanity’s knowledge on a new technical foundation, it seems reasonable to conduct some due diligence. Here are three key questions which ledger of record advocates rarely answer satisfactorily:\n1. What’s the plan for when data consensus fails to produce narrative consensus?\nThroughout history, when certainty is manufactured, the next step is always the same: Impose it.\nWhen the historical church failed to persuade, it responded with crusades. When corporate media fails to persuade, it responds with censorship.\nWhat’s the plan for when “cryptographic truth” fails to persuade?\n2. What’s the plan for ensuring public trust is well-placed?\nThe public will never have the technical knowledge to distinguish a secure oracle from a compromised one, relevant data from irrelevant data or honest interpretations from dishonest ones.\nHere’s why this matters: To the precise extent the ledger of record becomes important, power brokers will subvert it technically while praising it politically. They’ll corrupt oracles, migrate to insecure sidechains and cherry-pick data to manufacture circumstantial evidence.\nWhen they finally say “look, it’s all on-chain,” only a tiny cadre of politically outcast experts will be able to spot the fraud.\nHow will the public know it’s being defrauded, let alone meaningfully protest?\n3. Are you prepared to have your minds blown?\nIf decentralized oracles indeed produce “definitive truth,” they will quickly elevate a subset of fringe ideas to paradigm-shattering prominence. Why aren’t ledger of record advocates talking about this all the time?\nThese are the kinds of sentences I’d expect to hear from people who are seriously interested in discovering and mainstreaming suppressed \"truths\":\nGetting revenge on the media for lying about COVID-19 is nothing compared to this stuff. So why is that the main symptom of ledger of record fever?\nThe absence of wonderment in the face of unbounded discovery makes me worry that ledger of record advocates might already expect to cherry-pick on-chain data that fits their preferred narrative and vindicate their personal narrative vendettas.\nThey expect you to unquestioningly obey on-chain data and to change your mind when confronted by “definitive truth.”\nBut will they?",

These types of securities pool together assets such as mortgage loans, auto loans, student loans, credit card receivables and equipment leases.\nWhile blockchain is not new, the bank observes, the technology until recently had not developed to a level that was appropriate for banking and financial markets in “terms of scale, speed, flexibility and autonomy.”\nBut the “technology itself appears to have evolved enough since the Ethereum launch in 2015 to meet the critical demands of at least certain segments in the banking and financial markets.”\nOne of the most important advancements was the change in the “consensus mechanism” from the energy-intensive proof-of-work to the more energy efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, the note says.\nAcceptance of a universe made up of multiple “interoperable blockchain protocols” has also led to the development of more specialized blockchains that bring increased scale and speed, as well as higher flexibility and autonomy.\nThe “regulatory landscape is very fluid” given the speed of development of blockchain technology and how it does not exactly fit into existing legal and regulatory definitions, the report adds.",

    "title": "What’s a ‘Long-Term’ Time Horizon for Crypto?",
    "summary": "Crypto is different from other investments. It’s still becoming clear who’s in it for the long haul, who sees it as a cash grab, and who’s investing due to FOMO.",
    "content": "Most investors have an idea of how long they plan to hold something before buying or selling any type of asset.\nWhether it’s a target date fund or simply a medium-term investment vehicle started for, say, a down payment on a home, there’s been enough precedent for the majority of asset classes that retail investors can normally plan how long their cash will be tied up.\nThis article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.\nCrypto, however, is different. With just a little more than a decade of data – and that’s for bitcoin, not the 16,000+ altcoins in circulation – it’s still becoming clear who’s in it for the long haul, who sees it as a cash grab, and who’s investing strictly for the fear of missing out (FOMO).\nRegardless, it’s important to have a sound investment thesis explaining the “why” behind your crypto investments. That helps you determine how long to hold and discern whether you’re a trader or more of a subscriber to the “HODL” philosophy – meaning “hold on for dear life” and describing a long-term approach to crypto investing.\nIt turns out, the answer to that question depends on what crypto appeals to you. “The crypto and blockchain space is still in its early stage,” said Armando Aguilar, an independent crypto analyst and former digital asset strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “Holding periods depend on the investors.”\nDifferent investors, different strategies\nCrypto diehards and purists who believe blockchain and digital currencies are the future are probably planning to hold their crypto for many years to come. These investors should choose to buy tokens representing high-quality applications, protocols and ecosystems with strong communities backing them, according to Aguilar. All the signals for liquidity should be there, looking at market cap and trading volume. Plus, the asset should have evidence that signals high implementation and adoption, along with the ability to withstand volatility.\nMeanwhile, speculators and short-term traders may hold crypto for more sporadic periods of time. “Holding periods can vary from hours, to days, to less than a few months,” Aguilar said. “Long term can be seen as anywhere between five and 10 years, if we are to compare it to the internet adoption curve over time.”\nShorter, medium and longer term\nShort-term strategies parallel those of the stock market and include day trading, arbitrage and other moves meant to facilitate quick reselling and profits. Using popular crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and others, investors can buy, sell and trade as many times as they want from day to day.\nHowever, a strategy of six to 24 months requires that investors consider factors such as planned network upgrades, partnerships, roadmaps and project developments that could potentially materialize and as a result see positive price momentum. “These strategies are based on short to medium-term analyses where adoption, integration and business scalability have a major role in the investment analysis for investors,” Aguilar said.\nFinally, strategies that take three or more years to enact are often performed by people who stay abreast of crypto news, or even have a foot within the industry. This may include venture capitalists, family offices, and other long-term investors who have access to early stage deals at lower valuations, but are locked in their investments for longer periods of time, according to Aguilar.\nWhile an investor is “HODLing,” they may also make other decentralized finance (DeFi) moves, such as lending and staking, which may allow them to earn interest on their crypto. In these scenarios, they may allow their crypto to be locked up in the ecosystem and used to validate transactions, in exchange for passive income via interest. In addition, there’s always the possibility that their crypto assets will appreciate in value, leading to a longer-term gain.\nMoving forward\nAs an advisor, your role is to help your clients determine their “why” behind their crypto investment thesis, which will lead them to a conclusion about time horizon. Many financial advisors agree that blockchain technology could be a viable long-term investment, but there are dozens of ways to invest in it that appeal to a broad spectrum of investors (from passive to more aggressive).\n“Blockchain technology is what powers cryptocurrencies,” said Washington, D.C.-based certified financial planner Marguerita Cheng. “One way of benefiting from cryptocurrency without taking on as much risk is to invest in the underlying technology, digital payments or fintech. That’s a way in which you don’t have to deal with FOMO. Maybe you’re not going to get as much upside, but you’re still going to benefit from that exposure.”",

    "title": "The Importance of Bitcoin Upgrades and Layer Two Applications",
    "summary": "As a financial advisor with clients interested in bitcoin, it’s crucial to understand upgrades to its network and their potential impact on bitcoin’s investment thesis.",
    "content": "It’s no secret that the crypto community is divided around the support of bitcoin and alt coins, a term given to any coin that is an alternative to bitcoin. Some are in the camp that bitcoin, along with future technical improvements, will be the main – if not the only – coin that will survive. While others view this as impossible, it’s important to understand why these pro-bitcoin believers remain so convinced.\nCrucial to the advancement of bitcoin are the Bitcoin Core Developers. This is an international team of developers, often called “maintainers,” that is constantly monitoring, improving and working on bitcoin and its blockchain. This group, due to its decentralized nature, is funded by companies, such as Square, Coinbase, Gemini and others, and the community to maintain Bitcoin’s open-source and secure network.\nBitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)\nOften, these core developers will propose changes to the Bitcoin network. These changes are referred to as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and, if implemented, create a formal change to Bitcoin. True to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, anyone can propose a BIP. The community will discuss each BIP until it is ultimately accepted or rejected.\nUpon acceptance, each BIP is assigned a number and officially published on the Bitcoin Core GitHub. When this happens, the Bitcoin Core Developers really get to work. They test the upgrade and make sure it is safe to implement on Bitcoin. Once satisfactory due diligence is done on the BIP (often this is referred to as reaching consensus), the activation plan is created. Upon the network approving the BIP and the activation plan, the code is changed and the upgrade is implemented.\nSegWit and Taproot\nA notable BIP on Bitcoin was SegWit (BIP 141), which was activated in 2017. This upgrade modified the Bitcoin code and effectively increased the block size by removing signature data from Bitcoin transactions. In short, the BIP 141 upgrade allowed more transactions to be included in each Bitcoin block and therefore increased the Bitcoin transaction volume.\nThis November, Bitcoin will undergo the biggest upgrade to its code since SegWit. Taproot (discussed in BIP 340, 341 and 342) introduces what are called Schnorr signatures to Bitcoin. To avoid a very technical discussion, Taproot will improve privacy, scalability and finally implement smart contract functions on Bitcoin.\nOne of the major benefits of Taproot activation is the fact that multi-signature transactions will become much less data heavy, which blazes a Bitcoin path for smart contract implementation. Many alt coins were designed from the ground up with these improvements in place and therefore drew attention and investment away from Bitcoin. The Bitcoin developers took plenty of time to ensure this upgrade was safe before implementation. Many, including myself, view this as a monumental move for Bitcoin, and it certainly levels the playing field in the smart-contract competition.\nAs a financial advisor with clients interested in bitcoin, it’s important to understand these upgrades and their potential impact on the investment thesis of bitcoin. BIPs can have positive effects or negative effects when implemented on Bitcoin. Just as an advisor would listen to quarterly calls of companies whose stocks they hold for clients in order to determine future outlooks, the same applies to Bitcoin, and an advisor must remain aware of any future changes.\nLayer two applications\nAnother component of Bitcoin is what is called layer two applications. Very early in the history of Bitcoin, the community noticed scaling problems. If bitcoin were to ever become a global currency, or even compete with companies like Western Union, Visa or others, developers would need to create solutions that allow for cheap and fast transactions to always occur. The Bitcoin blocks would become too crowded, transaction times would be too long, and fees too high if a solution wasn’t presented and implemented. The Bitcoin mainchain can handle approximately three to seven transactions per second, a far cry from the 20,000 transactions per second that occur on credit card networks.\nBitcoin Lightning Network\nAlong came the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer protocol that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning takes transactions “off-chain.” Basically, bitcoin is removed from the main network and placed into a two-party, multi-signature “channel.” This channel is created between two parties and allows each party to send nearly an unlimited amount of transactions at a very low cost. These transactions happen specifically on the Lightning Network and not on the Bitcoin blockchain. Because these transactions are not approved by Bitcoin nodes or miners, the Bitcoin network is not affected. Upon terminating or closing the Lightning channel, all of the information included in the history of the channel is consolidated and included in a transaction that is then sent to the main Bitcoin blockchain (mainnet) to be recorded.\nTwitter recently announced tipping for all iOS users. For this to be possible, Twitter will rely on third-party companies such as Strike that provide the ability to link a Twitter account to a Bitcoin address and a Lightning Network address. The Lightning Network allows tiny amounts of money to be sent instantly to anyone with an address. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been a longtime proponent of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Many view this as an elegant solution to many problems faced in the global payment’s ecosystem. Many pro-Bitcoin investors are encouraged to see that such a large social media company is exclusively building on Bitcoin, and this adds to their Bitcoin-only conviction.\nWhat is clear is that Bitcoin Core developers are focused exclusively on improving Bitcoin. Through BIP implementations, layer 2 advancements, and the continued focus on Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is constantly able to compete with newer projects and continues to demand the majority of market share in the cryptosphere. Taproot and Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to remain competitive with other alt coins in terms of functionality, speed and security. Not only is bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency based on market cap, but the upgrades and core developers are working to ensure that bitcoin remains preeminent.",

    "title": "Anchor Protocol Reserves Slide as Money Market's Founder Talks Down Concerns",
    "summary": "The reserves have slumped 50% in four weeks because of an imbalance between loan demand and deposits.",
    "content": "The reserves of Terra-based lending and borrowing protocol Anchor, which offers a supposedly industry-beating benchmark deposit rate of around 20%, are sliding fast as a result of the crypto market crash.\nData provided by Terra.Engineer shows reserves have slumped by half to 35 million UST – that's Terra's native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin – in four weeks. It works out to an average decline of about 1.25 million UST per day. The crypto community is worried that the reserves will be drained in three weeks or so in the absence of corrective measures.\n\"The Anchor Yield Reserve was created as a buffer to maintain the 20% interest stability,\" pseudonymous market expert and Anchor user Duo Nine, who operates the Twitter handle @DU09BTC, told CoinDesk. \"However, this reserve has been running a deficit for weeks due to more deposits than borrowers on Anchor Protocol. At this rate, it will hit zero in 20 days.\"\nLUNA, Terra’s native token, dropped below the $50 mark on Friday and is down over 17% over the past 24 hours. It was recently trading at $49.31.\nWhile most decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms allow demand-supply forces to determine lending and borrowing rates, Anchor offers an almost fixed 20% annualized percentage yield (APY) to users depositing UST. The so-called \"anchor rate\" is set by holders of Anchor's governance token, ANC. At press time, other industry heavyweights were offering lending rates of less than 10%, according to data source defirate.com.\nThe project finances the super-high deposit rate from three income sources: interest charged to borrowers, staking rewards earned from borrowers' collateral – such as liquid staking proof-of-stake assets from major blockchains like bonded luna (bLUNA) or bonded ether (bETH) – and liquidation fees. Luna is the native token of Terra's blockchain, while ether (ETH) powers the Ethereum blockchain.\nIf the realized yield from the three income sources is greater than the anchor rate, the excess amount is kept aside as the UST-denominated Anchor Yield Reserve. The protocol taps into the reserve when the realized yield is less than the anchor rate, ensuring depositors are paid as promised.\nThe structure makes the platform's reserve vulnerable to market crashes and the resulting imbalance between demand for loans and supply of deposits. During bearish periods, traders are less likely to borrow UST to seek higher returns elsewhere, leading to a decline in loan demand. They are also more likely to supply UST tokens in a bid to make a relatively stable return, pushing deposits higher.\nThat's what seems to have happened since December, forcing the platform to persistently tap the reserve, as tweeted by Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, the decentralized financial payment network behind Anchor.\nData from Anchor Protocol show total deposits stood at 5.71 billion UST at press time, while the amount borrowed was 1.37 billion UST. That's a loan demand shortage of over 300%. The yield reserve was 34.13 million UST, and the anchor rate was 19.88%.\nThe situation perhaps indicates that fixed rates are unsustainable over the long run and yields are better determined by free interaction of demand and supply forces.\n\"The fixed yield of around 20% may not be sustainable,\" Duo Nine said. \"With the protocol facing a deficit, it needs fresh money in the form of increased loan demand to keep the anchor rate at 20%.\"\nFounder downplays concerns\nTerraform Labs' Kwon is trying to soothe concerns about a depletion in reserves, saying the mechanism was created precisely to ensure stability during market downturns. Early today, Kwon assured crypto followers on Twitter that the protocol would function as a regular DeFi money market if the much-feared scenario of reserves dropping to zero occurred.\n\"If we were to get to this hypothetical situation, Anchor will *still* offer the highest return on stablecoins. By far. It will be fine,\" Kwon tweeted.\nIt remains to be seen what corrective measures are implemented. Terraform Labs provided a cash injection of 70 million UST following the crypto crash of May-June 2021, which punctured the broader market bull run.\n\"The deployment is a one-off solution that will prevent the need for future intervention, allocating a significant runway for the protocol to introduce self-sustainable mechanics even during periods of low borrowing demand,\" Terra Research Forum's blog post Bolstering Anchor's Sustainability published in July said.\nExperts say a cash injection could be a temporary solution. It will, after all, have little impact on loan demand.\n\"A capital injection will prolong the health of the system, but generally, they need to either reduce the deposit rate or increase the utility for ANC token, so it's not viewed as a farming coin,\" Hassan Bassiri, vice president of portfolio management at Arca, a digital asset management firm, said\nBorrowers providing collateral are given ANC tokens proportional to the amount borrowed.\n\"ANC is also used as incentives to bootstrap borrow demand and initial deposit rate stability. The protocol distributes ANC tokens every block to stablecoin borrowers, proportional to the amount borrowed,\" the official explainer says.\nAn ANC token with increased utility might bring loan demand and greater income for the protocol, alleviating the pressure on the reserve. Kwon has assured that he is resolved to finding ways to subsidize the yield reserve.",

    "summary": "The securities regulator is hosting a blockchain hackathon next month as a first step towards establishing broader oversight in the country’s fintech space.",
    "content": "The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has big plans to regulate the country’s fintech space. As a first step, it is hosting its first ever fintech hackathon next month.\nThe ISA is looking to attract blockchain-based solutions that can improve the infrastructure supporting the securities and sovereign debt markets in Israel with the hackathon. The securities regulator has partnered with the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Start-Up Nation Central, as well as tech providers like VMware, Digital Asset and Algorand to host the onsite hackathon, which will be held on March 24, 2022, in Tel Aviv.\nThe hackathon will be led by privacy tech provider and World Economic Forum (WEF) Technology Pioneer QEDIT, which plans to help teams discover and bridge gaps in privacy compliance and regulation.\nAccording to Anat Guetta, chairwoman of the ISA, the blockchain hackathon is part of a larger initiative for the ISA to not only collaborate with professionals in fintech innovation, but to also start gathering the expertise and influence needed to regulate the fintech and the crypto sector more broadly.\nAn economist and banker with decades of experience, Guetta has been serving as the chairwoman of the ISA since 2018. In 2020, Guetta said distributed ledger technology had the potential to transform Israel’s capital markets.\nCoinDesk spoke to Guetta about the ISA’s plans for the hackathon and Israel’s long-term goals for regulating crypto.\nThe following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nCoinDesk: Why is Israel’s securities regulator hosting a blockchain hackathon?\nGuetta: The ISA is now the leading fintech regulator in Israel, and the hackathon is part of the activities that it is leading as part of this role. The main motivation behind the hackathon is to facilitate the transfer of technology from a developmental environment to applications in a large-scale live environment that may bring to light various technological, business and regulatory issues. We hope to integrate novel technologies to Israel’s existing capital market infrastructures, and we believe the ISA’s steps will encourage other regulators in the country to promote projects involving new technologies.\nWe also expect the hackathon to serve as a catalyst for effective and high-standard collaboration between various actors in Israel's financial system. The hackathon will serve as a meeting site between the ISA and developers, technology firms and academic scholars. Bringing together the teams of these technology providers will create an opportunity for regulators and for other stakeholders to gain in-depth technical knowledge on global fintech developments. This is also the first fintech focused hackathon to be organized by Israeli regulators.\nHow does this hackathon fit into the ISA’s broader plans for crypto?\nI must say that first of all, regulators are lagging behind when it comes to technology. It was always a fact, and it will be so also in the future. We are not so advanced, and we do not have the risk appetite that the industry has. We are here to balance and to monitor and to supervise.\nWe see crypto and blockchain as two separate phenomena. We see great potential for blockchain technology. Crypto activity is a separate issue that we are examining and considering how it should be supervised in a holistic way in Israel, as it should be in other areas in the world.\nWhat blockchain-based fintech solutions will be the focus of this hackathon?\nThe first thing that the hackathon will examine is the issuance of securities and government bonds. Different asset types like stocks and bonds have different issuance requirements, sometimes involving several different parties like brokers. It means that the originators of an asset do not usually have a direct channel to investors and buyers, which complicates the processes. This experiment will educate us about other innovative ways to lead issuances of securities and government using blockchain in the future.\nHow does Israel’s approach to regulating blockchain and crypto compare to other jurisdictions?\nThe ISA is part of the IOSCO organization, which is the association for securities regulators worldwide. It’s part of the main committees that are active on blockchain and crypto. My regulatory approach is that because Israel is not the biggest country in the world, because we are a very small and smart country, we don't have to reinvent the wheel each time that regulatory needs come up. I believe that the right way for Israel is what we call the passporting attitude. It means that we would accept an entity that has a current license from regulators that are accepted by the ISA. I believe that we will have to learn the state-of-the-art regulations by watching regulatory updates worldwide and learn how to adopt the rules for Israel.\nLooking beyond the hackathon, what should be the most urgent focus of a regulator in establishing oversight in the blockchain space?\nAt the end of the day, our aim is to get the power that we need in order to supervise and to build this new market for new participants because we understand that regulation, as in many other fields, is the license to do business. Blockchain producers, creators or marketers need regulation in order to have a clear idea of what is permissible.\nWe see the statistics. We see that most blockchain companies are not operating in Israel. They prefer to operate outside of Israel. I think that we’re losing them as an economy and as a country. We need very precise and clear laws in order to bring them back here. And we should create the conditions to let them work from Israel in a legitimate and acceptable way. So, our higher mission is to get the right powers in order to enable this.\nHow do you see the ISA regulating the crypto space?\nI believe that crypto needs a holistic regulatory framework in Israel that will cover the industry end to end. We’re looking very closely at what the U.S. and its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are doing.\nI think that the nuances that regulators are trying to find between different types of crypto assets is wrong. I think that we should take crypto as a whole and implement regulatory supervision on it because, otherwise, technology is smarter than us. Regulators did not notice when the initial coin offering craze started in early 2018. Today we have very sophisticated issuances of crypto that are not exactly securities like stablecoins or utility coins. We should take a very wide definition of crypto and have authorities supervise it. I think that this is the right direction.\nThe nuances between securities and crypto are not very clear. We cannot always define them using our legal tools. I think that, in the end, securities regulators should adopt crypto as a security regardless of its format without going into details. The public is exposed, and we cannot protect investors and consumers in the way that they should be protected from the crypto phenomenon. Opportunities are also going away because we cannot define what is eligible and what is not eligible in our market. So, this is the endgame that we should aspire to.\nI read that in January 2021, a company called Kirobo tried to prove that they were issuing a utility coin but the ISA ruled it was a security. Is this what you mean?\nYes, we have some cases where a token was defined as a security by the ISA, but if we have 14,000 different crypto tokens today and the ability to print a new one almost seamlessly, we cannot use the resources that were provided to us to protect investors to analyze each case. This is why my opinion is that we should have very wide responsibility for this new industry end to end and this is the only way to close the gaps that we have between the point that we should stand on and protect our public and the point that we are standing on today.\nWhen you said crypto assets should broadly be considered as securities, did you also mean cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as well?\nI don't want to go into specific examples, but I think that bitcoin is not different from any other. When bitcoin was created in 2009, it was a very small phenomenon before it became what it is today. Many other crypto assets that are active today are on the same path. So I don't differentiate between bitcoin but, as I mentioned, bitcoin is not defined as a security today and to go there, the ISA will have to get the rights and legislation to give us the right powers that we need that we currently do not have.\nWe have to wake up and understand that there is no real difference between crypto and securities and we have to unify the definitions in order to protect consumers and investors, and to make this industry legitimate.\nUPDATE (Feb. 14, 14:46 UTC): Adds Start-Up Nation Central and Digital Asset as partners of the hackathon.",

It is also an offshoot of the friendship between Carlson and Cohen, which dates to their joint conference appearances in 2017 and 2018. The pair, who have continued to meet at industry events, rank among the industry’s most influential figures and often share insights.\n“I’m thrilled to be joining the Chia team as we look to supercharge adoption and provide an eco-friendly way to deliver decentralized finance opportunities for people around the world,” said Carlson, who is also an investor with San Francisco-based Slow Ventures and member of the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Cryptocurrencies.\nCarlson co-launched the Open Money Initiative in 2019 to explore how people use money in closed economies and disintegrating currency systems.\nEarlier this year, she joined the board of the non-profit Mina Foundation, which supports the Mina lightweight blockchain protocol. But she has been selective about accepting directorship positions. Chia's mission dovetailed with central, intertwining themes in her career of boosting access to financial services and operational efficiency.\n\"For anyone working in this space, it comes down to asking yourself every day, 'Here are the things that I'm spending time on, do I believe in them, do I believe that they are going to be impactful on the lives of people?'\" Carlson said in an interview with Coindesk.\nShe sees Chia's approach as an \"alternative\" to financial products that \"fail users\" and \"exclude people.\"\nChia touts its decentralized blockchain and smart transaction platform as more energy efficient than competing systems. It launched its mainnet on March 17 and began enabling transactions on May 3.\nLast month, the San Francisco-based company closed a $61 million D funding round spearheaded by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Richmond Global Ventures. Slow Ventures also participated in the capital raise. At the time, Chia had an estimated $500 million valuation, according to a Bloomberg report, and Cohen has been upfront about his intent to take the company public in the near future.\nChia's other board members are Cohen; Hoffman; David Frazee, managing partner at Richmond Global Ventures; and Chuck Stoops, a veteran financial services and technology executive.",

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) of the Senate Banking Committee, recommended creating a simple disclosure-based supervision regime under the Consumer Financial Protection Act. DAOs, meanwhile, are to be given similar legal rights to those of a standard incorporated entity, including tax requirements and being allowed to open bank accounts and sign legal agreements.\nThe firm suggested three ways to shore up regulatory fragmentation and overlap. Those included harmonizing areas of jurisdiction among agencies, establishing an industry self-regulatory organization and setting up a nonprofit for technical oversight. In its fourth proposal, a16z reiterated the comments it made in August about the U.S. infrastructure bill that is pending in Congress.\n“The United States tax and regulatory environments are designed for centralized operations. Yet, as currently drafted, the infrastructure bill pending in Congress would impose tax reporting requirements on a wide array of actors who would have no ability to comply,” the firm said.\nIn August, Toomey, the Senate Banking Committee’s ranking member, issued a request for feedback in a bid to solicit ideas and legislative proposals on the best regulatory approaches to crypto and blockchain. Proposals were submitted from Aug. 26 through to Sept. 27.\nRead more: A16z Details Its New Approach to Crypto Governance",

    "content": "Against all authority\n“I told my parents, I’m willing to die on this hill. I don’t want to go on with this because it’s just about ticking boxes. My dad happened to agree.\n“We went to the school, I think it was on my 16th birthday, and I withdrew.”\nRead more: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021\nYou may not know Keonne Rodriguez by name, but you know his story. From the age of nine he compulsively played with the family computer, and was being paid to code web pages for local businesses by the time he was 14. He would go on to major success in the blockchain industry – but despite his obvious talent and focus, he had challenges with formal education.\n“I was in advanced programs, honors, advanced placement [but] I was really starting to develop an allergy to bureaucracy and things that didn’t make sense.” The breaking point came when his high school instituted a required computing course – one Rodriguez is certain he could have taught.\nThe college conundrum\nSome of the most successful people in the tech industry either didn’t attend or didn’t complete college. Famed dropouts include Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak – world-changers who made billions of dollars without a diploma.\nThose stories have become totemic in the tech world, even as broader skepticism of college spreads. That skepticism is partly driven by financial calculus: As tuition and student debt loads rise dramatically, there’s more reason to ask whether the investment in college is really worth it. Various startups and reformers have established alternative paths, from coding boot camps to online certification programs to radical new models like Minerva University.\nSome organizations, such as Peter Thiel’s Thiel Fellowship, push an even stronger line: not that college is too expensive or inefficient but that, at least for some people, it’s a waste of time at any cost. The Fellowship awards $100,000 to “young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.” Recipients must skip or drop out of college to be eligible.\nThat backdrop makes things particularly challenging and confusing for young people interested in careers in crypto. Spending three or four or five years on a campus could seem like a big sacrifice in an industry that changes so fast. And perhaps the single most widely admired person in crypto stands as an example of the potential of skipping school: Vitalik Buterin received the Thiel Fellowship in 2014 and, instead of going to college, used the time to build Ethereum.\nBut the data about college outcomes tells a much different story than the biographies of these few outliers. The average college degree holder will earn $625,483 more than a high school graduate over his or her lifetime. College graduates also have much higher lifetime employment rates, better lifelong health and even longer-lasting marriages, according to a 2015 study by University of Maine education researcher Philip Trostel.\nModerate critics of higher ed acknowledge this reality. “I’m a pragmatist. At the individual level, you should take the system as it’s constructed,” said investor Marc Andreessen during a 2020 interview that was otherwise quite critical of the status quo in higher ed. “I think it’s actually quite dangerous to give someone as an individual the advice, ‘don’t go to college.’”\nThe reality on the ground in the crypto and blockchain industries, too, seems a bit less freewheeling than the mythos would have it. While reporting this story, I reached out to about a dozen close contacts in the industry, asking if they knew anyone who had found a role building in crypto without going to college. Rodriguez was the only example I was able to unearth. Unscientifically, it seems the overwhelming majority of people with serious careers in crypto are college graduates.\nThat makes sense once you remember how many complex ideas are wrapped up in the design and deployment of blockchains. The crypto industry moves fast, but that’s in part because it draws from a many-layered, complex “stack” of intellectual traditions, legal norms and technical breakthroughs stretching back decades, even centuries. That includes not just extremely advanced computer science, but the far frontiers of securities law, economics, even sociology and art.\nThe bitcoin off-ramp\nKeonne Rodriguez defied those odds and immediately thrived – not just without going to college, but without even finishing high school. Despite his outlier status, his means of ascent holds career lessons even for people who do take the college route.\nMost importantly, Rodriguez was able to clearly demonstrate his real-world effectiveness thanks to a portfolio of web design work built up in his early teens. His portfolio was the first step towards a string of full-time positions that grew his skill set further, at the same age he would have normally been attending college. Eventually he found himself a very well-paid coder and designer at Cleversafe, a security company that’s now part of IBM.\nBut then things hit a rough patch, thanks to the same thing that was derailing a lot of tech careers circa 2012: Bitcoin.\n“I got so obsessed with bitcoin that I couldn’t stop tweeting about it,” Rodriguez told me. “So [Cleversafe] got concerned. We mutually decided it was better for me to focus on my passion.”\nThings moved fast after that. Rodriguez, who was based in the U.K., showed up at an early bitcoin conference organized in London by Blockchain.com.\nBlockchain “had just gotten some money from Roger Ver and they were building out the initial staff. I just told [them], I’m interested, here’s my portfolio and if you guys need someone let’s talk. I was interviewed by Dan Held and Changpeng Zhao.”\nThose names may sound familiar. Nearly a decade later, Held is head of growth at the crypto exchange Kraken. Changpeng Zhao is slightly better known as “CZ,” the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by a country mile. Rodriguez became employee number eight at Blockchain, living and working with a small initial crew in York, U.K. He eventually became head of user experience for Blockchain’s wallet, then its main product.\nBut can you write poetry?\nRodriguez, who evolved from web coding to front-end design, could clearly demonstrate results. But in fields where results are less tangible, that approach doesn’t work as well. “Anyone with hopes of a managerial position needs a college diploma,” for example, according to Steve Mintz, a historian and education researcher at the University of Texas.\nThat also applies to much of the high-level, back-end system design work involved in blockchain projects. In fact, blockchain encompasses so many deep concepts that it’s an ideal introduction to computer science as a whole.\n“I use blockchain as a way to introduce a number of computer science fields in my courses,” says Professor Ron Van Der Meyden at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “Here we’ve got this brilliant application which, to really understand how it’s working, there’s a lot of pieces of computer science we can introduce – cryptography, consensus. And each of those has a whole lot of [complexity] behind them.”\nThat sort of deep theoretical knowledge may seem abstract from the outside, but according to Van Der Meyden, it’s extremely practical.\n“You can look at a particular thing you need to code, and identify within that problem, [for example,] here’s something that a finite set automata would be good for,” he says. “You learn how to think about, ‘I’m not just going to write a program, I’m going to really care about how efficiently that program performs.’ That requires a conceptual toolset.”\nThat’s why Van Der Meyden believes there’s little comparison between the strictly functional coding knowledge conveyed in condensed courses, and what students get from a full computer science degree.\n“With respect to code camps, I would say that what those are giving you is just the coding skills. It’s kind of like, you can speak English but can you write poetry?”\nVan Der Meyden also believes those pushing against college may have a point – but only within their own very narrow sphere. Peter Thiel “is thinking of his experiences in Silicon Valley, Harvard, Yale, that small fragment of the world,” he says of the entrepreneur’s Fellowship program. By contrast, many of Van Der Meyden’s students come from developing parts of Asia. UNSW considers educating these students something of a social mission because it ultimately helps their home nations advance and grow.\n“That’s a very different world than the world Thiel is thinking about.”\nCollege in context\nAs Marc Andreessen pointed out, it’s important to separate the broader debate over college from individual decisions. Simple math shows that going to college is still the right choice for those who have the option. And this is crypto – we trust math, right?\nStill, it’s important to be tuned in to the broader debate, which breaks down into essentially two camps. On one side are those who focus on declining public spending on higher education, which has pushed costs on to students. On the other side are those who argue the university model itself is broken, and that new educational approaches and less reliance on credentials are the longer-term solution.\nIt’s important to keep in mind that critics of traditional colleges are often trying to profit from the alternatives. Andreessen Horowitz has substantial investments in edtech startups trying to disrupt college with new models for financing and delivering education. So does Peter Thiel – making the Thiel Fellowship as much a marketing expense as a philanthropic project.\nBroadly, would-be education disruptors “unbundle” the college experience – with its partying, athletics and residence halls – from pure education. For example, it was for a time thought that Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOC, would upend the traditional college model by providing free or very cheap lectures from top-tier professors, available anywhere in the world.\nBut the promise of edtech has become much hazier. The coronavirus pandemic shutdown of most in-person schooling was a chance for online learning to shine, but it largely wound up demonstrating the limitations of education ripped from its social context and individual feedback. Endless Zoom lectures and isolation have led to mass burnout for students and educators alike. That shouldn’t have been a surprise – remote alternatives had already proven ineffective for most learners. Fewer than 15% of participants, for instance, complete MOOCs.\n“I think it’s much more than creating great content and putting it up on the web,” David Deming, professor of education and economics at Harvard, said on the a16z podcast last year. “I think that’s why MOOCs haven’t revolutionized the market, because that’s not what education is. Education is not just content, it’s also engagement and personalization.”\nIt’s also worth remembering that even as some members of the American elite voice skepticism of traditional college, others are willing to go to absurd lengths to get their kids on exactly that path. The 2019 college admissions scandal arguably showed just how valuable college is to the wealthiest Americans, who were willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and commit obvious fraud to fake admissions credentials for their unimpressive spawn.\nBut that’s just the egregious tip of the double-standard iceberg: One recent study found that 43 % of white Harvard students were either legacy admissions (students attending the same college their parents or other relatives attended), athletes or related to donors. (The rate was under 16% for non-white students). If those kids aren’t going to code camp or getting an education on YouTube, maybe you shouldn’t be either.\nOn the other hand, it’s true that college isn’t for everyone, and it’s certainly not perfect. I know that firsthand: My initial career goal was to become a professor, and I even earned a PhD and landed a short string of research jobs.\nUltimately, I found myself leaving academia. I had a variety of reasons, but a big one was that I saw the life of the mind dying a slow death in American higher education. During my career I taught at universities and colleges of various stripes, and found that many of them were havens for mediocrity and stasis, with professors merely pantomiming research – and even more often, pantomiming teaching.\nThere are still many colleges full of brilliant, engaged people in wonderful, grass-green settings, and I have walked that sort of glorious lawn. But not every college is the intellectual Arcadia of myth – in fact, it sometimes seems that fewer and fewer of them are. And this, too, is borne out by the numbers: For non-technical fields like business and social science, the rank and quality of a school has a major impact on the career prospects of its graduates.\nThe quitter’s dilemma\nOn both sides of the college debate I heard consensus on at least one good reason not to go to college: if you really, really don’t want to.\n“For someone who is convinced that they’re a genius and don’t need a college education,” says Trostel, the education researcher, “they’re not going to put in the effort and they’re not going to get much out of it.”\nIn other words, it’s not that being brilliant guarantees you’ll succeed without a degree – it’s that without some humility, you’ll never earn one. Unlike most investments, education doesn’t just require time and money, but also mental and emotional focus. If you can’t or won’t apply those, you might as well not waste resources trying to earn a degree.\nThis was certainly true for Keonne Rodriguez. As much as his clear passion and portfolio justified skipping college, he was also very self-aware about the challenges he would face with a traditionally structured education. He even tried to attend college, twice, after completing his GED. His second try was at a computer science program at Oxford.\n“I figured, it’s such a prestigious program, it must be different,” he says. “But I figured out it’s not the program, it’s me.” He dropped out, and soon after that he joined Blockchain.\nCases like Rodriguez’s, it must be emphasized, are exceedingly rare – particularly because Rodriguez, whose father was a lifeguard, didn’t come into the world with either a thick family bankroll or a built-in professional network. Many of the world’s celebrated dropouts rely on those advantages: Bill Gates’ father, for instance, was a prominent lawyer, and his mother was a major business figure who helped Microsoft ink a crucial early deal with IBM.\nAnd as much as we celebrate successful dropouts, it’s just as important to remember those who fail. We don’t know most of their names, but you might include Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook has made him fabulously wealthy, but blindness to complex social impacts may earn his creation the same infamy now accorded tobacco and oil companies. Or take Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who modeled herself after Steve Jobs, in part by dropping out of Stanford. She is now facing criminal fraud charges in large part because of her lack of education in the basic medical science at the core of her failed company. At age 37, her name is tarnished forever.\n“There’s also an ethics component” to education, says Matthew D’Amore, a professor and associate dean at Cornell Tech, which offers courses on blockchain and the law. “How does my idea fit into the world? Is my idea just designed to make money or is it designed to improve people’s lives? Those kinds of things don’t necessarily come naturally to folks, and the opportunity to get that perspective exists on a college campus differently than elsewhere.”\nIt’s a final helpful way to think about the college question for aspiring blockchain innovators. Going straight into the workforce might seem like an immediate way to learn practical skills – but it’s hard to say in advance what “practical” really means. The complexity of crypto isn’t just in the technical dimension: It touches on nearly every aspect of human life, and its transformative potential is so profound it demands truly deep, expansive thinking. And the industry rewards that: it’s certainly why I’m here.\nFamous dropout Steve Jobs, surprisingly, is also evidence for the value of a broad education. Though he left the formal college track, he frequently sat in on college courses. The most important one wasn’t about computers at all: The seeds of Apple’s nuanced design philosophy, the differentiator that helped it become the world’s most valuable company, were planted by a course on calligraphy taught by a former monk.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Network Sees Fourth Straight Downward Difficulty Adjustment",
    "summary": "\"The last four adjustments have been downward, and it now looks like the blockchain is back to normal,\" one analyst said.",
    "content": "Bitcoin's mining difficulty, a metric indicating the effort required to solve the complex cryptographic puzzle to mine blocks and validate transactions, recorded its fourth straight drop over the weekend.\nOn Sunday, difficulty fell by 4.8% at block 691,488, having declined by a record 28% on July 3, according to data tracked by BTC.com. The difficulty rate now stands at an 18-month low of 13.67 trillion. That's down 45% from the mid-May peak of 25.05 trillion.\nAccording to The Block, the network last recorded four consecutive declines in difficulty in 2011.\nThe bitcoin mining difficulty undergoes automatic adjustment every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes. The reward for mining blocks and approving transactions is currently 6.25 BTC.\nThe time taken to mine new blocks rises when there is a drop in the amount of computing power applied to the blockchain. At that point, the programmed code kicks pushes the difficulty lower to attract more miners and restore the average block time to 10 minutes.\n\"Since May, the blockchain has been running slowly. Earlier this month, the average block time reached 1,000 seconds, when they ought to average around 600 seconds.\" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said.\n\"To rectify that, the blockchain needed to speed up and make mining easier. The last four adjustments have been downward, and it now looks like the blockchain is back to normal,\" Morris said.\nThe self-adjusting mechanism makes bitcoin mining somewhat analogous to perfect competition, a hypothetical market structure where forces of demand and supply interact freely and firms' decisions are predictable.\nThe difficulty rate peaked at over 25 trillion in the second half of May and has been falling ever since amid China's crackdown on cryptocurrency mining. The mean hashrate peaked along with the price in mid-April and hit a two-year low of 61.22 exahashes per second (EH/s) in late June. Since then, it has recovered slightly to 96 EH/s, according to Glassnode data.\nThe dramatic decline in both the hashrate and difficulty could be a short-term phenomenon, as there is evidence that China-based miners shifting to the U.S. and Kazakhstan could soon become operational.\n\"This is a one-off event, meaning most of this mining power will return, and before you know it, MORE than 900 coins per day will be mined since the hash rate will hit the network after the difficulty of each block decreases,\" Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, noted in a Substack post published last month.\nAlso read: Bitcoin’s ‘Puell Multiple’ Flashes Misleading Bullish Signal as China Bans Mining\nThe drop in the mining difficulty has not had any bearish effect on the cryptocurrency's price, leaving it directionless in existing ranges. Social media chatter shows some traders are worried about a deeper drop as prices ended Sunday (UTC) below $34,000, marking the lowest weekly close of the year. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $31,300.",

    "summary": "The indicator trades at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy, a blockchain analytics firm said.",
    "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) current valuation perhaps presents patient investors with an attractive opportunity to take exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency.\nThat's the signal from an indicator called Reserve Risk, which measures the risk-reward ratio of allocating to bitcoin based on the conviction of long-term holders. The metric compares the incentive to sell offered by the going market price to long-term holders resisting the temptation to liquidate.\nReserve Risk stood at 0.0024 at press time, having found acceptance under the green zone below 0.0027 in late January. The risk-reward ratio is considered attractive when the metric hovers in the green area.\n\"This metric will trade at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy,\" blockchain analytics firm Glassnode's weekly newsletter published Monday said.\nIn other words, a low reading indicates that conviction among HODLers – slang from long-term crypto investors – is high and they refuse to spend their coins. Therefore, there is an attractive risk/reward for prospective buyers to dip their toes into the market.\nHowever, in the past, Reserve Risk has hovered in the green zone for prolonged periods, marking a slow transition from the final phase of the bear market to the mid-stages of a bull market. So, investors looking to add exposure to bitcoin, tracking the low Reserve Risk need to be patient or have the ability to endure long periods of underperformance before big returns manifest.\n\"Reserve Risk has traded at historically undervalued levels for 77 days so far, although this is far shorter than the multi-year periods seen in 2015-17 and 2018-20. Note, however, that Reserve Risk generally signals undervaluation well into the bull market as HODLers typically commence distribution only after a new price [all-time high] is set,\" Glassnode's weekly report said.\nBitcoin was trading largely unchanged on the day at $46,600 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.\nReserve risk is calculated by dividing bitcoin's price at any point in time by the \"HODL Bank,\" as detailed by Glassnode, which represents the opportunity cost of holding an asset. \"Each day a coin is held, the owner defers the ability to exchange it for its cash value,\" according to Glassnode.",

    "summary": "Can a blockchain decrease turnover and absenteeism while improving productivity in factories? Yes, preliminary research from New America suggests.",
    "content": "Blockchain has already improved companies’ ability to track the movement of goods. But what if we use it to track how people experience work? That could unlock an entirely different perspective on global supply chain dynamics. It’s now easy to envision a more efficient future in logistics through emerging decentralized technologies that help improve procurement practices and enable businesses to increase transparency about where products were manufactured, how they were delivered and under what conditions.\nAllison Price is a senior adviser to the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative at New America. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).\nThere are potential upsides for businesses, workers and consumers. But it’s equally important to also weigh the challenges and potential impacts. A healthy balance must be struck between the creative dreamers envisioning a beautiful decentralized future and the question-asking pragmatists who are responsible for effectuating it safely. Thoughtful, inclusive debate is the key to forging a more equitable future supported by technology companies, governments and communities designing together.\nOver the past two years, a coalition led by New America, Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise (SHINE) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, ConsenSys and the Levi Strauss Foundation have collaborated to develop a new approach to factory worker well-being assessments.\nBy integrating the SHINE Well-Being Survey into a secure blockchain platform that can be deployed in person or remotely, workers are empowered to safely share their workplace experiences. The minimum viable product (MVP), Survey Assure, aggregated survey responses from workers and protected them with the Ethereum blockchain creating an immutable record. The system used this protected aggregated data to create a visual presentation of survey results, which reflect the opinions of an entire factory workforce in close to real time.\nThis approach wasn’t your typical supply chain tracking pilot. The unvarnished nature of the anonymized survey data of factory workers in Poland and Mexico created tremendous potential for workers, business and human rights. It helped factory management better pinpoint where potential investments could improve worker experiences. These interventions and management’s subsequent actions have the potential to decrease turnover and absenteeism while improving sustainable and productive practices.\nThis solution couldn’t be more timely as organizations focus more on the health and well-being of workers in the coronavirus pandemic recovery era. And although we were meticulous in testing the concept safely and ethically, it will be far more difficult to do at scale.\nThis experimental pilot project was ambitious. Blockchain may be going more mainstream, but harnessing it for non-fintech applications is still nascent. We encountered challenges around costs, ease of use, data digitization and integration, engineering talent, literacy, reliable internet access, the lack of hardware needed to take a survey, and an unprecedented global pandemic that has disrupted not just supply chains but also workers’ lives.\nSee also: Blockchain Technology at Pivot Moment Mirrors Broadband, CMCC Global Says\nBut there is real and often unrealized value in identifying what complicates innovation. It allows us to explore where there is need for additional research, structure and investment.

    "summary": "Binance is not responsible for \"rug pulls\" on Binance Smart Chain, an exchange representative says.",
    "content": "Decentralized finance protocols built atop Binance's smart-contract blockchain, Binance Smart Chain, have suffered an increasing number of hacks or exploits. Those include an exploit earlier this month on bEarn Fi that resulted in an $11 million loss.\nA Binance representative on Wednesday suggested that's just the way things are in DeFi, and there's little the world's largest exchange can do to roll back the exploits. It's the case even though the exchange retains a significant degree of control over Binance Smart Chain, making it far more centralized than competing blockchains.\n“BSC is a public permissionless infrastructure so anybody can deploy projects there,” Samy Karim, a coordinator of business and ecosystem development at Binance, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021. “You have malicious actors there and hacks, and exploits in DeFi are not new and definitely not unique to BSC.”\n“It is not possible in the way that a lot of people think for there to be some kind of rollback,\" Karim said.\nIn just under nine months, BSC has grown dramatically, making headlines as one of the more competitive rivals to the Ethereum blockchain, sometimes referred to collectively as “Ethereum killers.”\nThe BSC blockchain's security algorithm, known as Proof-Of-Staked-Authority (PoSA), is controlled by 21 node operators, which are elected by Binance Coin (BNB) holders. But Binance is one of the largest holders of the BNB tokens, so it still has significant control.\nAfter some of the recent exploits, some Twitter users have criticized Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, demanding that the exchange take responsibility for the exploits, colloquially referred to as “rug pulls” in the industry jargon.\nChristanto asked Karim whether BSC would become more decentralized in the future.\n“Our approach is really more focused on educating and supporting the developer ecosystem,” Karim said, when asked whether BSC might become more decentralized in the future.\nRead More: DeFi ‘Raises Challenges’ for Investors, Regulators, SEC’s Gensler Says\nHowever, Karim said during the session that he has seen “fairly significant interest” from institutions in BSC and DeFi, and that his team will focus on meeting their requirements, such as transaction privacy.\nInstitutions “require for transaction privacy, potentially private pools or private lending pools or money markets that have different features than what you see today,” he said. “So it’s not completely permissionless that just anyone can participate.”",

    "title": "Why MOBI’s Blockchain ESG Tests Matter",
    "summary": "The organization’s recent partnership with trade group MEF is meant to help with large-scale projects like measuring tailpipe emissions.",
    "content": "At first glance, the partnership of MOBI, a technology provider for internet-connected vehicles, with cloud computing trade group MEF, might look like just another big-ticket blockchain consortium play.\nAfter all, MOBI, which stands for the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, has been focused on building infrastructure for vehicles and internet-of-things (IoT) commerce for several years now, and it already accounts for a large slice of the global gross domestic product in terms of its automotive industry membership; MEF (originally known as the Metro Ethernet Forum) has been around since 2001 and includes most of the world’s large telecommunications firms.\nWhat On-Chain Access for AGI Unlocks\nBut scaling up and standardizing MOBI’s so-called Integrated Trust Network (ITN) – a combination of blockchain-based trust anchors, decentralized identity verification and digital twins of vehicles and components – is yielding breakthroughs with the most compelling use case of all: saving the planet.\nAn example from MOBI’s stable of environmental, social and governance (ESG)-friendly use cases is the tracking of the tailpipe emissions from more than 280 million registered vehicles, carried out in a joint pilot program with the European Commission. (The Commission is soon to release a report on the trial.)\nMeasuring carbon emissions in the atmosphere accurately is notoriously tricky and has even been called the “Paris Conundrum,” in reference to the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. The important takeaway from MOBI, which started out building on Hyperledger but is now “blockchain agnostic,” is its demonstration that tailpipe emissions can be accurately measured on a suitably grand scale.\n“In most of the developed world, mobility is the largest source of carbon emissions,” MOBI co-director Chris Ballinger said in an interview. “And yet, nobody focuses on it, because it’s so dispersed. There’s no way to measure it accurately. The MEF brings the connectivity and the ability to message, transact, exchange. We’re bringing the ability to locate things in space and time with identifiers for decentralized objects and IoT.”\nDigital twins\nIts first standard, the MOBI VID, or decentralized identifier (DID), is a digital twin of a vehicle. DIDs enable verifiable digital identity in a manner that’s decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers and certificate authorities.\nRead more: Microsoft’s Decentralized Identity Head Leaves to Join Square\nA plethora of standards now exist for carbon accounting, usually developed in a siloed and non-cohesive way, explained MOBI co-director Tram Vo. Blockchain technology with its essential characteristics of consensus, immutability and track-and-trace, combined with digital identity standards, offers a solid foundation.\n“So essentially, for Web 3 commerce, everything needs a digital twin,” Vo said in an interview. “But for that digital twin to be trusted, it has to be connected to a DID and then the whole ecosystem of verified credentials, and then you can do business.”\nThe MOBI system also features two channels where data is shared and broadcast, including a public channel that shows a digital twin anchored to the ITN and a private communication channel, dubbed Citopia, where smart contract-enabled business automation can happen.\nPay as you go\nThe trustless Citopia layer will explore the use of verifiable credentials to incentivize greener behavior, said Vo, including a pay-as-you-go approach to pollution, road congestion and so on.\nThis means that in addition to tackling the environmental component of ESG, MOBI is looking at ways to address the “G” or governance part of the equation, Ballinger said. It’s now possible to have the location of a vehicle tied to its identity as well as to a host of other data – like whether it’s an electric vehicle or internal combustion, what its weight is, whether it’s traveling at a congested time, whether it’s a carpool, etc.\n“There’s $27 trillion of road infrastructure and no good way to finance it,” Ballinger said. “Pay-as-you-go opens up a totally new source of public infrastructure finance that I’m convinced will be replacing the gas tax. Everybody’s looking at how to charge for roads and solve the infrastructure deficit. This is such a perfect solution.”",

    "summary": "Centralized exchanges registered a net inflow of 5.7 million OMG tokens on Friday.",
    "content": "OMG, the native token of the OMG Network layer 2 scaling protocol for Ethereum offering faster and cheaper transactions, crashed on Friday.\nThe cryptocurrency fell 27% to $12.70 as exchange inflows spiked in what appeared to be a classic “sell the fact” reaction to Boba Network’s completion of a snapshot for an airdrop, or free BOBA coins, to OMG holders.\nOMG hit its lowest price since Oct. 28, falling below the 50-day moving average (MA) support after 3 1/2 months, CoinDesk 20 data shows.\nBlockchain data shows investors transferred coins to exchanges in large numbers early today, possibly to liquidate holdings.\nCentralized exchanges registered a net inflow of 5.7 million OMG tokens on Friday – the largest influx on record. Increased transfer of coins to exchanges represents investor intention to sell, while continued outflow is a sign of solid holding sentiment.\nThe price sell-off and exchange inflows picked up the pace during Asian trading hours after Boba Network, a new layer 2 product created by blockchain developer Enya in collaboration with OMG Network, announced a snapshot – a Polaroid record – of balances held by OMG holders on the Ethereum network and the Boba Network.\nOn Nov. 19, these recorded wallets will receive free BOBA governance tokens in proportion to their OMG holdings at the snapshot time.\nThe price drop comes after a strong rally that saw prices reach a three-year high of $20 earlier this month. The cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $6 last month as the lure of making free money from the impending Boba Network airdrop drew demand. OMG also benefited from the broad-based rally in coins associated with Ethereum layer 2 projects and Ethereum alternatives like Solana and Polkadot.\nThe uptick in the lead-up to the airdrop snapshot and the subsequent sell-off is related to the “buy the rumor, sell the fact” trade often observed in stock markets and recently seen in bitcoin. The concept is based on the belief that market participants, being forward-looking, tend to buy an asset when expecting positive developments and take profit, driving the market lower on confirmation of the news.",

    "summary": "Some analysts are optimistic about the broad crypto rally and see further upside, especially for ether.",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) rallied near $43,000 on Friday as short positions continue to unwind from the second quarter sell-off. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is up about 1% over the past week compared to a 17% gain in ether (ETH) over the same period.\nSome analysts are optimistic about the broad crypto rally and see further upside, especially for ETH. On Thursday, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain rallied past $2,600 as the network's latest hard fork upgrade, dubbed “London,” officially went live.\n“A mood of optimism appears to have returned to cryptocurrency markets,” wrote Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, in an email to CoinDesk. “Still, the turbulence that we’ve seen in crypto markets over recent weeks is unlikely to subside.”\nLatest prices\nCryptocurrencies:\nTraditional markets:\n“BTC is also showing strength, which is expected to carry on next week, as it broke out of a downtrend today which dated all the way back to the previous all-time highs in April,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk.\nFrom a technical perspective, bitcoin’s rally above $42,000 is an encouraging sign. Friday’s strong price action is an attempt to break above the intermediate-term downtrend, which, if confirmed, could yield further upside towards $50,000 to $55,000 resistance.\n“The market has been oversold for quite some time,” said Kevin Kang, founding principal of crypto hedge fund BKCoin Capital, in an interview with CoinDesk. “I think we are resuming the bull market in the coming months.”\nEther bullish activity\nThe bulk of ether options activity has been concentrated in the higher strike, longer duration calls, or bullish bets.\nData provided by Switzerland-based Laevitas shows ether volumes on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, have increased by more than 50,000 ETH to 153,000 ETH ($424 million) in the past 24 hours. That takes it to the highest level since the end of May. On Deribit, one ether options contract represents 1 ETH.\nOverall, call options have registered higher activity than puts, and the most popular options have been calls expiring March 2022 with strike prices of $50,000 and $40,000, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.\nRecent bullish activity surrounding the Ethereum network upgrade contributed to ether’s outperformance relative to bitcoin, albeit with greater volatility. The chart below shows that ether tends to be more volatile than bitcoin.\nBitcoin transaction volume\nBitcoin’s total transfer volume (entity-adjusted) has grown to $7.48 billion a day over the past 14 days, indicating greater activity on the blockchain as the cryptocurrency’s price rises, according to Glassnode.\nTransactions over $1 million in size, which represent roughly 46.5% of total transaction volume, were rising, Glassnode noted.\n“Entity-adjustment” is a methodology Glassnode developed to measure on-chain volume that actually changed hands. “Entities are defined as a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode's proprietary clustering algorithms,” Glassnode wrote. (Read more here.)\nLINK, MATIC, ETH volumes rise\nThere has been a steady increase in LINK’s volume on Coinbase, according to the exchange. The number has grown by 35% since the protocol released its smart contract kit v0.10.10 on July 25, which includes full support for Optimism. The volume in MATIC declined this week.\nMeanwhile, on Aug. 4, one day ahead of EIP 1559, ether’s volume outpaced that of bitcoin by 61%.\nAltcoin and DeFi roundup\nRelevant news:\nOther markets\nMost digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended higher on Friday.

    "content": "Stock and bond issuance, trading and settlement via blockchain technology will be tested in the European Union under a five-year pilot program approved by the European Parliament in Brussels.\nLawmakers hailed the pilot legislation Wednesday as putting the bloc at the “forefront of innovation.”\nThe measure was first proposed by the European Commission. It will give EU members the chance to test out new crypto applications that would otherwise be blocked by existing laws governing financial market infrastructure.\n“It is not only vital to make existing financial legislation fit for digital, but also to show an openness towards new technology that could make financial markets safer and more efficient,” said Parliament member Johan Van Overtveldt, who negotiated the deal between Brussels and national governments that had been tentatively approved last year.\nBut Van Overtveldt, who previously served as Belgium’s finance minister, warned that crypto experiments that appeared to work on a small scale might still raise unexpected risks if they move beyond the pilot stage.\n“What works in a limited testing environment does not necessarily work in a broader context,” he said, adding that lawmakers in the future would need to “thoroughly scrutinize the exemptions … before upscaling.”\nMairead McGuinness, the European Commission’s most senior financial-services official, hailed what she described as “groundbreaking work” that could enable financial markets to “safely experiment” with innovative technology more efficiently by allowing traditional financial instruments like stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds to be tokenized in spite of strictures normally contained in EU law.\nThe plans, which now seem set to pass into law, represent a relatively pro-innovation move from a legislative body that is also dabbling with ending anonymity in online payments and limiting proof-of-work assets like Bitcoin because of their supposed environmental impact.\nFor some lawmakers, the pilot goes too far, and they say it amounts to a loophole in laws on financial trading and infrastructure intended to protect investors and safeguard financial stability.\nVoting against the pilot project law “is not opposition to innovation,” said Ireland’s Chris MacManus, a member of Parliament’s far-left political caucus. Rather, his vote is “opposition to irresponsibility and industry lobbying leading to a pilot project spiraling into what would be effectively be an exercise in deregulation.”\nRead more: MiCA Could Still Be Delayed by EU Parliamentarians Over Proof-of-Work Provision",

    "summary": "Red Date Technologies CEO Yifan He was showing off the BSN stack in public for the first time.",
    "content": "It’s not often you hear a battle cry for enterprise blockchain these days. But that’s just what the architect of China’s powerful Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) delivered at Consensus 2021.\nSomewhat in line with China’s latest spate of warnings, Yifan He, the CEO of Red Date Technologies, strongly advised blockchain companies to look beyond mere cryptocurrencies, and urged developers to access this new, multiple cloud-based, “one stop shop” and start building.\n“Do not put 100% of your resources into public chains and cryptocurrencies,” said He. “Just give a little bit of money and resources to the underlying technology and research. Because we can do so much besides cryptocurrency.”\nThe hype around enterprise blockchain endeavors in the U.S and Europe has died down, but China’s BSN appears to be fired up over private/permissioned or “consortium chains,” citing applications across industry, government and areas like medicine.\nRed Date’s He showed off the BSN architecture for the first time in public, albeit at a “very early stage.” There was a cloud services layer with AWS, Google Cloud, China Mobile and AliCloud, and above it was a blockchain technology, or “Public City Node” layer, where various types of distributed ledger, both public and private, are made available.\nUnlike blockchain projects in the West, China’s BSN initiative is backed (and guided) by the government. Red Date, which started out in 2014 building “smart city” technology across China, is joined by the State Information Centre of China, China Mobile and China Union Pay.\n“It has dozens of public chains, and almost all of the major permission frameworks,” He said. “We made a lot of changes for developers to easily access all the technology. We unified API gateways and certificate management so there is one set of certificates and one gateway to access all the public chains and all the private chains and make them interoperable.”\nOracle services and zero-knowledge proof technology will be added in the coming months, added He.\nAll this hand-holding equates to a system where developers can spin up blockchains at minimal cost in a matter of a couple of months. He did not stipulate which flavors of blockchains would be available to devs at the “Portal” layer of the BSN. But ConsenSys, which has now taken on full-time husbandry of the Ethereum-based permissioned Quorum blockchain, was part of a recent announcement involving BSN.\nHe continued by saying the BSN can easily be deployed within company intranets, while also allowing access to a range of public chains. Overall, he called it “a very powerful enterprise solution.”\nPerhaps it’s not surprising the BSN espouses private blockchain deployments over public. After all, it’s not just a headline risk for a bunch of timid banks; the Chinese government holds sway.\n“We have BSN China, and BSN International,” said He. “Because of regulations, we only offer public chain services outside China. Because it's not very legal in China.”",

    "summary": "Investors are again HODLing for the long-term, taking liquidity out of the market.",
    "content": "Bitcoin posted its steepest weekly gain in three months last week, and blockchain data hinting at renewed supply-side weakness indicates further advances may be in the offing.\nThe top cryptocurrency by market cap added 12.4% in the seven days through Aug. 1, the most since the final week of April, according to Bitstamp data. It advanced 18.4% in July, snapping a three-month losing streak, and was last changing hands near $40,000.\nData tracked by Glassnode show bitcoin's illiquid supply, or the balance held by illiquid entities, decoupled from prices in May, signaling renewed holding sentiment. The measure reached a record high 14.447 million over the weekend.\n\"Amount of bitcoin held by the strongest holders has retraced the whole dump and surged to [all-time high]. This is very bullish,\" Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer at Moskovski Capital, tweeted.\nThe figures show investors are again holding for the long term, or HODLing, reducing the supply of coins available for sale in the market.\nBitcoin supply currently is 18.77 million, or 89% of the 21 million cap. However, according to Glassnode, the actual number of coins available for trading is much lower due to increased hoarding by investors and permanent loss of mined BTC over the years.\nWhile bitcoin moved in tandem with illiquid supply from October 2020 to May 2021, it diverged in mid-May. As the chart shows, the link may now be reestablishing. A similar split occurred for several weeks before bitcoin began its meteoric rise from $10,000 in October 2020. If the illiquid supply continues to rise, a supply-side crisis may emerge, and last price year's surge may be repeated.\nOther blockchain indicators also signal an impending supply squeeze, as tweeted by analysts Willy Woo and Will Clemente.\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, the bull case would strengthen once bitcoin establishes a foothold above a three-month descending trendline.\nThe trendline hurdle is $42,464 at press time. That's also the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from April's high to May's low.\nAlso read: GoldenTree Adds Bitcoin to Its Balance Sheet: Report",

    "summary": "If we want to expand the metaverse, developers should take lessons from pre-blockchain game developers.",
    "content": "Game developers have solved staking, liquidity pooling and other aspects of blockchain technology, but they are still whiffing on the gaming part of their projects.\nThey focus too much on token implementation. If we want to expand the metaverse, developers must do better. Pre-blockchain games that were wildly popular may offer at least a partial road map for them to follow.\np0x Labs Co-Founder on Developer Adoption of AI\nZach Hungate is director of gaming at Everyrealm (formerly Republic Realm), a metaverse innovation and investment company.\nHere’s what current game developers should do to propel the industry.\nIn 2020, gaming on the blockchain was truly revolutionary. Axie Infinity’s popularity skyrocketed, mainstreaming the play-to-earn model for a world forced to work remotely. Fueled by innovation, the industry’s trading volume surged 8,300% year-over-year, pushing the market capitalization to nearly $30 billion.\nRead More: Axie Infinity Finds Ready Players in Hyperinflation-Racked Venezuela\nFast forward one year and everything looks … roughly the same.\nSure, there are more crypto games today, but scroll through dAppRadar, and you’ll notice that the majority of blockchain games are either “tap-and-wait” idle-clickers, thinly veiled yield farmers or generic collectible card games. If crypto gaming purports to be a driving force behind the metaverse, why are most blockchain games entirely one dimensional?\nBlockchain technology has the potential to empower players in an unprecedented fashion, enfranchising users as partners with financial compensation and governance ability. However, these factors alone cannot drive mass adoption when the games themselves lack depth and immersion.\nHow many blockchain games have lore or world building? Where is the community-driven content and engagement on social media? It’s difficult to even find YouTube or Twitch gameplay of crypto games that supposedly have hundreds of thousands of users.\nCrypto gaming is saturated with re-skinned versions of early iOS and social network games. Alien Worlds, Upland and Bomb Crypto all heavily limit gameplay with cool-down timers, arbitrary action limits and depleting features similar to energy or stamina. Farmers World and Sunflower Farmers are carbon copies of the original FarmVille. These titles all relinquished playable content in favor of the ability to mint NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and exchange native tokens for in-game currency. But blockchain should be an augmenting, not a primary, feature for a successful game.\nTo that end, Web 3 games will require a healthy balance of on-chain and off-chain features. In a fully on-chain architecture, recurrent, expensive transaction fees can negatively impact gameplay for small activities, particularly if the game is built on a busy ecosystem like Ethereum.\nDevelopers also face unique challenges in using blockchain technology, such as whether game features will enable token manipulation and arbitrage opportunities, or otherwise be impacted by market forces that are part of the in-game economy. Introducing off-chain gameplay allows developers to deploy useful aspects of the blockchain, while avoiding its drawbacks.\nLooking back to go forward\nFor the industry to progress, gaming studios need to look backward to legacy developers. Open world Web 2.0 video games like Roblox and Minecraft offer players unrestricted environments that they can customize, resulting in ecosystems where users and independent developers generate much of the in-game content.\nRead More: What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?\nFor example, Minecraft servers may use third-party plug-ins to establish decentralized virtual economies, enforce basic land and property rights, and create internal governance structures. Simultaneously, these virtual worlds have grown alongside the player base, allowing players to discover new items, areas and strategies and to independently bring them to the community. On the blockchain, this would mean that assets for sale in exchanges or marketplaces should always be player created or earned.\nWhich they aren’t.\nOver the last two decades, the world’s largest games (e.g. League of Legends, Fortnite, World of Warcraft) grew on the freemium model, where users have limited game access at no cost and pay premiums to receive additional in-game features. This model gives users a way to trial the game before paying anything, an important distinction between today’s crypto games and what has worked in the past.\nThere are rumblings that major studios will solve the industry’s problems in their releases. But, with current projections pushing AAA (large studio) blockchain game releases as far out as 2024, is the industry meant to stagnate in the interim?\nIndependent studios or user-modified forks of big box games drive gaming innovation. The entire MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre and esports scene spawned from a player-made custom map for StarCraft and a community-developed mod for Warcraft 3.\nDon’t be caught off guard when the dominant blockchain game of the next decade arises from a small studio before the AAA gaming brands ever publish a pixel.\nColey Hungate contributed reporting to this essay.",

Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.\nIn the proverbial chicken-or-egg debate, cryptocurrency and blockchain happened simultaneously, says Robert Konsdorf, the CEO of Facings, a Michigan-based company that creates user-friendly blockchain publishing tools. Bitcoin was both the first publicly debuted blockchain and the first cryptocurrency. Some 12 years ago, its inventor, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, authored a famous document known simply as the Bitcoin white paper describing the concept for the world.\nToday, there are reportedly hundreds of blockchains floating around the metaverse, all with varying degrees of functionality and relevance. “You can take the code for any blockchain and make a new one out of it,” Konsdorf tells CoinDesk. “So there’s a lot of goofy or dead ones that don’t have real investment or operations.”\nBut however goofy blockchain may appear – or be – the technology is here to stay. So if you or your clients have questions, we’ve got a few answers to help you out.\nExplaining the appeal of blockchain\nSimply put, a blockchain is a particular kind of digital database that’s distributed among computers or groups of computers called nodes. Nodes are hubs through which all the electronic information inside a respective network gets generated, sent and received. Blockchain is the ledger that collects and stores this data in groups, or “blocks.” Hence its name.\nBlockchain technology is still in its early days. “I always tell people blockchains are really slow, really expensive and really public databases,” says Konsdorf.\nBut the databases are immutable, says Ashok Ranadive, director of professional services at the enterprise blockchain company, CasperLabs—which is a game changer.\n“The history is recorded in a clean manner,” Ranadive tells CoinDesk, unlike the countless number of messy records used to maintain most of our institutions currently. This suggests the potential for unprecedented financial transparency. Once you make a transaction on blockchain it can’t ever be deleted, only modified. The ledger is composed of an ongoing series of additive records that erase nothing and preserve everything.\nLast, blockchains are decentralized. They aren’t regulated by a government, a bureau, a corporation, a bank or any third-party body of any kind. Through what are known as “smart contracts,” each transaction on blockchain contains instructions in the form of code.\n“The way the money is controlled is actually just what is written in the software,” explains Phillip Gara, director of strategy for the Render Network, a company that uses blockchain to process high-quality graphics. Arguably, you might say a form of auto-regulation occurs within the code’s instructions, and that this theoretically eliminates the need for enforced compliance to any kind of governing body.\nThe limitless potential of blockchain\nOnce blockchain becomes universally adopted, the average person probably won’t need to know how exactly it works so much as how to actually use it. Consider the internet. How many of us know what IP addresses are, what routers are doing behind the scenes and how a transport control protocol works? We just need to know how to log on, input our password and go to the websites we want to visit.\nAccording to Konsdorf, blockchain will likely become a place where “humanity can put public records that mean the most to society.” For instance, smart contracts could be written to document monetary exchanges, voting records, deeds and proofs of authenticity.\n“These are all constructs that can benefit from having a high degree of public data integrity,” Konsdorf says.\nThe potential of blockchain as an infrastructure is seemingly limitless, with recent happenings on Wall Street indicating a growing confidence from investors in crypto and the technology.\nGetting started\nTo get your clients started with blockchain, talk them through opening their first crypto wallet. The most beginner-friendly way to start learning about crypto and blockchain is with a centralized exchange like Coinbase, which monitors transactions and uses standard KYC protocol to validate users’ identities.\nAs with most sensitive information, encourage your clients to use good data hygiene, such as storing their public and private wallet keys in a secure location (not somewhere that can be easily hacked like Evernote or Google Docs).\nAnd if your clients aren’t interested in cryptocurrency, there will be opportunities to invest in more passive blockchain-related securities in the future. The companies creating this software are ramping up fast, and eventually blockchain tech and VC firms will go public and trade on all major exchanges. While the enthusiasm surrounding crypto and NFTs can easily create FOMO [fear of missing out], it’s good to remind clients that we’re just at the beginning, and staying abreast of the latest blockchain news is a good stepping stone for someone who’s still unsure of how they want to get in on the action.",

    "summary": "Some in the industry now go so far as to predict a sixfold increase in the total dollars raised using such funding methods over the next four years.",
    "content": "A recent large-dollar funding round by Securitize signals that security tokens may be poised for a comeback.\nIf so, more private companies will bypass traditional initial public offerings (IPO) and instead use blockchain technology to digitize the capital-raising process. Some in the industry now go so far as to predict a sixfold increase in the total dollars raised using such funding methods over the next four years.\nSecuritize, which helps private companies raise money by issuing tokens, completed a $48 million Series B fundraising round on Monday. Morgan Stanley and Blockchain Capital co-led the round, which was oversubscribed.\nWhile this niche failed to live up to the hype of the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency boom, several firms interviewed by CoinDesk said they expect the security token industry to finally take off on a global scale, citing strong demand from issuers and investors. Security tokens are digitized versions of traditional instruments such as stocks and bonds. Some even expect this industry to surpass the market volume for cryptocurrencies in the next five years.\nIn terms of proceeds, the global security token market could reach $3 billion by 2025, growing at 56.9%, compounded annually, according to security token marketplace Area2Invest.\n“Two years ago, there was no infrastructure for a security token marketplace: no licensed platforms, broker-dealers, and no transfer agents,” said Max Dilendorf, a crypto lawyer at Dilendorf Law in New York. “The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent [registration] of Securitize as a transfer agent is yet another sign that the industry is prepared for take-off.”\nShunning IPOs\nA security token offering can give companies room to remain private longer and expand their investor base without the burdens of being a public company, proponents say.\n“The shine has come off launching an IPO. Companies are staying private longer and most of a company’s value is generated when it is private and young,” said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize.\nIn May, crypto wallet provider Exodus concluded a $75 million offering of its Class A common stock using security tokens.\nThe offering came after the SEC’s decision to raise the Regulation A limit, allowing companies to raise up to $75 million in a 12-month period for individual investors, generally only permitted for accredited and institutional investors in traditional capital raising methods.\nDue diligence required\nHowever, not all security tokens are quality offerings.\n“Investors are judging unique offerings based on the expected return on investment,” said Dave Hendricks, CEO of Vertalo, an Austin, Texas-based startup that helps issue and manage digital securities. “Many of the early security token offerings were micro-funds (sub-$10 million market cap). Founders decided that issuing a security token would attract a class of investors that were more interested in how the security was formatted rather than the underlying quality of the offering.”\nDespite optimistic projections, market participants caution that widespread adoption of security tokens will take time.\n“Adoption of security tokens has been slower than we originally anticipated as regulatory view and market adoption takes time,” wrote Saum Noursalehi, CEO of tZERO, a provider of blockchain technology for security tokens. Still, there are early signs of growth. For example, tZERO noted a recent uptick in issuer interest with $54 million traded on the platform in 2020, up from $5 million in 2019, according to the company, in an email to CoinDesk.\nAnd others are seeing even more activity, indicating what could be ahead. Dilendorf Law has “$1 billion in tokenized securities in the pipeline, seeing major players enter the game looking to fundraise on a global scale,” according to the law firm.",

    "title": "Waves Breaks Into Top 50 Crypto Rankings With 240% Monthly Gain",
    "summary": "Explosive growth of the Waves-based Neutrino protocol seems to have powered the token higher.",
    "content": "A lesser-known cryptocurrency has risen to prominence in a broader market marred by macro uncertainties, thanks to a cocktail of positive fundamental developments and the perception of flows stemming from the digital asset's Russia links.\nWAVES is an inflationary token offered as a reward for mining blocks on the decentralized, open-source blockchain Waves. The token has rallied 240% to $30 in the past four weeks and is one of the best-performing coins, with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, CoinDesk data shows.\nThe rally has helped the cryptocurrency make it to the list of top 50 cryptocurrencies by market value. At press time, WAVES was the 41st largest digital asset with a market capitalization of $3.35 billion.\n\"The main reason waves has climbed up is that Neutrino protocol's total value locked has increased by 338% in the past month,\" Rudy Chen, an analyst at crypto ratings firm TokenInsight, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.\nNeutrino is an algorithmic price-stable multi-asset protocol based on Waves facilitating the creation of stablecoins with values pegged to real-world assets such as national currencies or commodities. Data tracked by DefiLlama shows Neutrino is the biggest protocol on Waves, accounting for 62% or $1.74 billion of the $2.8 billion locked in the Waves-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Total value locked is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess the DeFi sector's growth.\nThe supply of Neutrino's dollar-pegged decentralized stablecoin USDN has increased substantially in one month, perhaps putting upward pressure on WAVES. Per Messari data, generating USDN requires locking WAVES in Neutrino's smart contracts, while USDN redemptions have the opposite effect of destroying the stablecoin to unlock WAVES supply.\n\"The outstanding supply of USDN has increased by approximately 66% since mid-February (around +350 million USDN) which means that an equivalent dollar amount of WAVES was locked up in Neutrino to mint that new amount of USDN,\" Gabriel Tan, investment analyst at The Spartan Group, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. \"This could have been a substantial demand driver for WAVES if a large chunk of the locked-up WAVES was bought off secondary markets.\"\nCoinGecko data shows the market capitalization of USDN has increased by more than 60% to $736 million in one month, perhaps powering the waves token higher.\nAccording to observers, there have been two sources of demand for USDN and, therefore, bullish pressures for WAVES. First, increased investor interest in staking USDN on Neutrino and other avenues. Second, the broader market lull.\n\"Why the increase in the outstanding supply of USDN? It could be because of the relatively high USDN staking annual percentage yield or APR of 9.5% on Neutrino or 19.84% APR for supplying USDN on Vires.finance,\" Spartan's Tan said.\nUsers can use USDN as collateral to trade or mint synthetic assets or stake the stablecoin to earn an extra yield. Staking refers to holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins. The process is analogous to passive investing. Vires.finance is is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol based on Waves Blockchain, enabling users to participate as depositors or borrowers.\nInvestors typically park their money into stablecoins, which offer price stability and protection from broader market volatility during times of stress. And they may have done so over the past several weeks, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the-then lack of clarity about the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening plans weighed over both crypto and traditional markets.\n\"When the market fell, people tended to sell their crypto assets and turned into stablecoins. That's why Terra's LUNA token and WAVES outperformed the market, because they both have strong community consensus on their algorithm stablecoin, UST and USDN,\" respectively, Token Insight's Chen noted.\nSome have associated the WAVES rally with the recently implemented Waves 2.0 upgrade announced last month. The upgrade is expected to make the network faster, more secure and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible.\nHowever, Spartan's Tan disagrees. \"One could argue that the Waves 2.0 announcement on Feb. 11 triggered the rally, but I think this is unlikely. The rally only started happening in the last week of Feb (unless the markets are so inefficient and slow to price in the announcement),\" Tan quipped, drawing attention to the dour market response to the similar announcements made by other blockchains in the past.\n\"If you look at past [Ethereum Virtual Machine] compatibility announcements for other chains like Kava, Cronos and Near, none of those token prices rallied three times in the one to two months post-announcement like what WAVES cryptocurrency has done,\" Tan added.\nWhile developers announced the Waves 2.0 upgrade on Feb. 11, the token began rallying later that month around the time Russia invaded Ukraine. That has some observers wondering whether the early move higher resulted from speculations jumping the gun on Waves blockchain's association with Russia.\n\"Waves was misperceived by markets as a Russian/Ukraine-associated project and may have attracted speculative demand from traders who want to ride the Russian/Ukraine narrative,\" Spartan's Tan said.\nWaves blockchain is sometimes referred to as Russia's Ethereum owing to its association with Rostec, a Russian manufacturing giant and misconceptions about Waves founder Alexandr \"Sasha\" Ivanov hailing from Russia.\nHowever, Ivanov told Bloomberg early this month that he is a Ukrainian citizen and the rally in WAVES tokens has got nothing to do with the situation in Russia.\nUPDATE (March 24, 11:12 UTC): Amends headline.",

    "title": "The 3 Reasons Why Bitcoin's Ascent May Slow",
    "summary": "Bitcoin has taken back half of the gains lost in the April to July period, but bullish momentum may slow.",
    "content": "Bitcoin has risen 70% in the past four weeks, topping the $50,000 mark for the first time in three months. While the ascent appears to have revived the broader bullish bias, further gains toward record highs may be slow to come, blockchain metrics and chart factors indicate.\nPickup in exchange inflows\nThe number of bitcoin held in exchange wallets is rising, departing from the recent trend of outflows and a signal of renewed investor intention to sell.\nData tracked by Glassnode show crypto exchanges received 16,606.80 BTC on Monday, the highest daily net inflow in over a month. Over the past week more than 29,000 BTC have been moved to exchanges. \"[It's] not a trend we want to see continue,\" William Clemente, lead insights analyst at Blockware Solutions, tweeted.\nInvestors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges when they plan to sell. Assuming demand-side pressures remain unchanged, the increase in the exchange balance may put the brakes on the price rally, if only temporarily.\nThe exchange balance declined by more than 100,000 BTC in the three weeks ended Aug. 19, reflecting a largely bullish market sentiment. Bitcoin bottomed out at about $30,000 and recovered to $45,000 during that period.\nWhale accumulation halts\nWhales, or large investors with an ability to make or break market trends, who accumulated coins after the mid-May price crash, have begun running down their inventory.\nThe supply held by entities with a balance of 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC has declined by nearly 75,000 BTC over the past three weeks, diverging from the rising price.\nEntities refer to clusters of addresses held by a single network participant. These large investors began accumulating coins after bitcoin's slide to $30,000 in mid-May, signaling a price bottom. Bitcoin held on to the support in subsequent weeks and bounced this month.\nThe recent price action also reflects weakening on the buy side. \"The failure to close the day above $50,000 shows some weakness in demand,\" QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel. Bitcoin printed a high of $50,496 on Monday, but closed the day (UTC) below $50,000. At press time, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at about $49,400.\nQCP Capital doesn't foresee exponential upside breakouts like those at the end of 2020. The firm also mentioned the continued calmness in implied volatility, or investors' expectation for price turbulence, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust discount as reasons for moderation in the bullish outlook.\nThe annualized one-month implied volatility is hovering near the recent low of 82%, even though bitcoin rose above $50,000 on Monday. Meanwhile, GBTC shares traded at a discount of 14% to their net asset value on Monday, according to data provided by Skew. \"As a proxy for U.S. interest, GBTC should at least trade at par if we are to expect any strong follow-through in spot,\" QCP Capital said.\n\"The clear trade for us here is short vols [sell call/put options] as we expect the spot to be sticky around the $48,000-$51,000 level,\" the firm added. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)\nChart barriers\nTechnical studies indicate the cryptocurrency may consolidate before scaling the critical resistance level of $51,110, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the mid-April to July sell-off.\nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is now sidelined and not showing a clear directional bias. \"A consolidation triangle in the RSI also reflects the hesitancy in the market despite the positive price action,\" QCP Capital said.\nThe DeMark indicators are signaling short-term upside exhaustion, according to Fairlead Strategies' weekly research note published on Monday. The weekly stochastic indicator is also signaling overbought conditions.\n\"Bitcoin is coming into resistance at a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level near $51,000, which would be a natural place for a short-term pause in the rally,\" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in the weekly research note.\nStockton, however, added that the long-term momentum has strengthened, with the 200-day moving average (MA) rising again. As such, the cryptocurrency would eventually topple resistance at $51,110.\nAlso read: Bitcoin on Longest Weekly Winning Run in 9 Months Ahead of Jackson Hole Symposium",

    "summary": "The blockchain where the future of finance will be built has zero downtime, zero forking, complete finality and a community of active developers.",
    "content": "The blockchain industry seems unique, new and frantic, but the evolutionary pattern of new industries over time is eerily consistent. Consider the California gold rush, the global oil boom or the rise of the internet.\nEach of these economic disruptions saw a similar pattern. The first is a shift from speculation to substance. Each industry that survived began with the promise of riches, with speculation in these new worlds accelerated by marketing, often highlighting the sizzle. All of it is designed to create true believers and drive adoption.\nW. Sean Ford is chief operating officer of Algorand, a blockchain platform that powers the creator economy and a range of projects that converge traditional and decentralized finance.\nThe second element of economic disruptions is shifting demographics. Over time, the mix of people who are early adopters changes, and other types of individuals, institutions and companies start to move in. These new participants then put pressure on the field to introduce what is necessary to successfully build these new industries.\nThird, the value that's created in these new sectors often comes after the initial dust settles. It's the second wave of participants that start steering things toward building real businesses, with fundamentals that become the foundation for sustained growth.\nThe blockchain industry is shifting to substance. The fundamental understanding of what is possible is far clearer. We've seen lots of use cases. The demographics have shifted. Institutional capital is entering the space. You know you're starting to get somewhere when there is the potential or actual use of blockchain by tens of millions of people who don't necessarily even know that they're using blockchain.\nThe good news for blockchain is that an increasing number of people want to understand the technology and how to create value in a meaningful way. The more sophisticated the participant is, the greater the demands placed on the industry. Traditional models for understanding value in our space do not conveniently translate from what was used in the past.\nThe question is, with an industry that's often been so focused on short-term value, how do we create enduring value, and what does it look like?\nThere's no great definition of enduring value. However, I’ve adapted a concept from Michael Porter, who wrote a number of books on competitive advantage and strategy, which focuses on long-term economic decision-making. According to Porter, the core attributes of value creation remain consistent, regardless of technology and pace of change. If we apply this thinking now, then all the hype around the blockchain and crypto market volatility is irrelevant to the essentials of value. What really matters is what this technology ultimately enables – real, long-lasting value.\nFrom the beginning, this long-term focus has been a core part of how we think about building value at Algorand. When we launched the company in 2019, I struggled with how to describe what we were trying to build. The best I could come up with is that we were building a new type of economic engine, like a national economy or country, where all types of value, data and immutable records can be created and exchanged on a global scale.\nWhat are the qualities you seek in a traditional economy?\nA simple view is that the combination of all these attributes working together dictates the pace of innovation. For example, Singapore invested heavily 50 years ago in education, technology, favorable trade practices and simplifying the ease of doing business. Its per capita gross domestic product 50 years ago was less than $1,000. Now it’s about $60,000 per capita.\nThe question is, what's the biggest variable to performance from one nation to the other? How much friction exists in each of those areas? More friction leads to a slower pace and these four pieces working together more ineffectively. Imagine if you could build a new economy from scratch. What if you could do it in a way that removes the friction?\nThe blockchain where the future of finance will be built is one that has zero downtime, zero forking and complete finality. It will need a strong community of active developers, and a growing number of users and use cases. It would also need to be built with sustainability in mind.\nThe ultimate winners in this space will be those who are relentless in their pursuit of removing friction and focus on building enduring value.\nWhere does the blockchain industry go next? The best thing we can do is try to roll out a robust standard of economic indicators that are consistently measured and applied across all web protocols. We will find the right measures and metrics to show which projects create real value and to let the real winners succeed and progress quickly.\nThe blockchains that succeed will continue to innovate, build and create a new kind of economic engine that has an enduring value on the best technical infrastructure in the world. That is what ultimately matters.",

    "content": "On Tuesday, CoinDesk Research will drop its Quarterly Review for Q3, featuring 60 slides jam-packed with insights, analysis and data. For me, one of the takeaways is that like it or not, we live in a multi-chain world.\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.\nFor example, the report notes that in September bitcoin dominance – that is, the original cryptocurrency’s share of total crypto market capitalization – was 42%. That’s the lowest it’s been at that point in the year in any of the previous four years.\nThe report’s authors, CoinDesk Research analysts George Kaloudis and Teddy Oosterbaan, are careful to note this is due to an explosion in growth of other networks rather than a lowering of bitcoin’s power.\n“BTC losing dominance does not imply that it is losing, especially as it continues to cement itself as a sound money and global monetary network,” they write. “Waning dominance for bitcoin more accurately suggests that there is money flowing into other projects with different use cases, as typically occurs during times of optimism in digital assets.”\nAnd flow it has. Note that while Ethereum’s share was higher in the most recent September than at any time in the series since 2017 – the heyday of initial coin offerings and CryptoKitties – the share for all other blockchains was the highest of any of the last five Septembers.\nAs Kaloudis and Oosterbaan note throughout the report, alternative “layer 1″ (L1) blockchains gained popularity as the congestion and high fees on Ethereum spurred demand for networks with similar smart contract capabilities but faster throughput. At least, faster for now. Baseball legend Yogi Berra’s quote comes to mind: “Nobody goes there anymore. It’s too crowded.”\nYou see this demand reflected in the market capitalizations of these L1 networks’ native currencies and the total value locked (TVL), or money invested, in their decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Cardano’s ADA, Binance Smart Chain’s BNB, Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX and Terra’s LUNA are now in the top 12 coins by market cap.\nWhile Ethereum remains king among DeFi host networks, look at how diverse these bars measuring TVL have become:\nAgain, bitcoin remains the crypto market’s bellwether, the coin with the greatest institutional adoption and network effect, with an unparalleled level of security hard won by miners’ politically incorrect energy consumption. (Disclosure: It’s the only coin I own.) That seems unlikely to change.\nBut the Bitcoin network’s scaling limitations, along with those of its largest competitor, Ethereum, mean neither can count on becoming the only game in town any time soon.\nThe CoinDesk Quarterly Review for Q3 also covers non-fungible tokens (NFT), stablecoins, BTC’s performance relative to gold and stocks and more.

    "title": "The FTC Doesn’t See the Difference Between Crypto and LuLaRoe",
    "summary": "A warning that lumped crypto exchanges with MLMs is misguided. But it’s also an important window into regulators’ mindsets.",
    "content": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Oct. 26 sent what’s known as a “Notice of Penalty Offense” to more than 1,000 companies, including the crypto exchanges Blockchain, Gemini, U.K.-based Bixo and other fintech and crypto firms. The notices, which warn businesses not to overstate the earning potential of investments or business opportunities, were also sent to a large number of gig-work platforms, multi-level marketing firms (MLMs) and franchise companies, all of which can sometimes resemble exploitative pyramid schemes, and often leave would-be entrepreneurs feeling duped.\nThe agency makes clear that the notices are not in any way indicative of misconduct by the companies. Instead, the regulator says the companies are now “on notice that if they deceive or mislead consumers about potential earnings, the FTC won’t hesitate to use its authority to target them with large civil penalties.” At worst, it seems plausible that crypto exchanges have made what the FTC sees as excessively optimistic statements about the growth potential or safety of speculative cryptocurrency investment, and the notice is a warning to cool their jets a bit.\nUnfortunately, that has left the exchanges lumped in with some companies that I would argue are far more exploitative. “Gig” platforms also getting FTC warnings included Amazon and Amazon Web Services (with their Mechanical Turk and gig-delivery systems), as well as Fiverr, Postmates, Upwork and Uber. Investigations have shown that such gigs often amount to working for below minimum wage.\nThe list also includes MLMs with names like Candle Divas, Closet Candy and Herbalife. These companies offer “business opportunities” often requiring huge startup costs that turn them, in effect, into insider-enrichment schemes. The dynamics were recently chronicled in the documentary “LuLaRich,” about clothing MLM LuLaRoe (which also received an FTC warning yesterday). MLMs remain legal, in part thanks to the political clout of people like Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\nFinally, the list includes a lot of franchise operations. These are also sometimes twisted into something very closely resembling an MLM, with large up-front licensing fees that drive revenue for a parent company but leave franchisees deep in a hole. I strongly recommend the in-depth examination of franchising as a labor-law workaround by the podcast “The Uncertain Hour.”\nAs much as we may hate to see crypto exchanges lumped in with such sketchy categories, there are important takeaways. First and most simply, the inclusion should be taken seriously as an index of how regulators still often see crypto: as a den of scammers looking to grift regular people. As genuinely exciting as crypto is right now, it’s worth keeping that context in mind before, say, hitting “send” on some dumb Tweet about how bitcoin is going to be worth a million dollars per coin by 2022. A little restraint could help the sector earn better treatment by regulators.\nThe second takeaway is more complex, and has to do with the economic context for crypto’s growth. The FTC points out in its announcement that “as the [coronavirus] pandemic has left many people in dire financial straits, money-making pitches have proliferated and gained special attention …\n“Americans are bombarded by offers that often prove to be less than advertised.”\nThis is actually underplaying it: The explosion of MLMs and gig work stretches back to the aftermath of the Great Recession, when good jobs became much, much more scarce. Both models often exploit either the desperation triggered by joblessness or the dream of entrepreneurial independence held by many workers who see themselves as miserable wage slaves.\nWhile cryptocurrency is a real and substantive innovation, the truth is that much crypto investment is driven by the same economic context. Over the years I’ve seen some really worrisome behavior (such as mortgaging houses for leverage) from people hoping to get rich quick on crypto and escape their economic straitjackets.\nObviously, that has worked out for many in the short term, but many crypto prices (like the prices of many stocks right now) are still well above what’s justified by actual user demand. That means they’re still speculative and risky, particularly for smaller retail investors who can’t weather downturns or bad bets. Long-term faith in the sector will benefit from clearly communicating the exciting potential of these new technologies – but also clearly laying out their risks as investments.",

    "title": "Crypto Exchanges See Biggest Bitcoin Outflow in 7 Months. A Reason to Cheer?",
    "summary": "\"This traditionally bullish signal should be interpreted with caution and in the context of other indicators,\" one analyst said.",
    "content": "With the price of bitcoin off almost 50% from its all-time high, bullish traders are hanging their hopes on a fresh data point that might show the market is nearing a bottom: a big surge in outflows of the cryptocurrency from exchanges.\nWhile it's too early to tell if the outflows will be sustained, the data might indicate that some traders are satisfied with the current price and have no intention of liquidating their bitcoin (BTC) on the exchanges. In the logic of cryptocurrency markets, the traders might be moving their coins to wallets, custody or cold storage while awaiting the price of bitcoin to rebound.\nCrypto exchanges registered a net outflow of 22,550 BTC on Monday, the biggest single-day net drain since Nov. 2, 2020, according to data provider Glassnode. The blockchain analytics firm tracks flow from 13 bit cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.\n\"The outflow can best be described as multifaceted, bordering on HODLing, and the use of the digital currency in decentralized finance,\" Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at the global payment network Mercuryo, told CoinDesk. To \"HODL\" is crypto-market slang for buy and hold.\nThe number of bitcoins held in exchange wallets fell to a three-week low of 2.54 million from 2.56 million.\nInvestors typically move coins from exchanges to wallets, taking out liquid supply from the market when they intend to buy and hold in anticipation of price rallies.\n\"Investors appear to be storing their assets in hardware wallets with anticipation that the current drop in price will balance out for new price runs toward and above its previous all-time high,\" Kozyakov added.\nSome investors take direct custody of bitcoin and tokenize the coins on the Ethereum blockchain to earn extra yield. Tokenization refers to locking up bitcoin on Ethereum and issuing an equivalent number of tokens tied to bitcoin's price. The tokens can then be deposited in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocols.\n\"With bitcoin in DeFi, investors get to maximize their earnings amidst dwindling prices, a better option for many who prefer not to keep their assets idle,\" Kozyakov said.\nData from the website DeFi Pulse shows total bitcoin locked in smart contracts has grown from 94,000 in April to about 174,000 now.\nSuch tokenization of bitcoin on other networks is also a source for the reduction of supply in the market.\nAll things considered, the latest outflow of bitcoin from centralized exchange paints a bullish picture. However, Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, called for a cautious approach.\n\"The market is currently lacking direction, sentiment is mixed, and many metrics are reporting lower demand, so this traditionally bullish signal should be interpreted with caution and in the context of other indicators,\" Deane said.\nBitcoin is currently trading near $33,000, representing a 1% drop on the day. The price fell by 35% in May on environmental concerns and China's regulatory crackdown.\nWhile exchange outflows have picked up, demand from \"whale\" entities – those with sizable holdings whose actions can theoretically move the market – remains muted at best. While the supply held by entities holding 1,000 to 10,000 coins has increased by 35,000 BTC to 4.183 million this month, the tally remains below the May 24 high of 4.186 million.\nA sustained increase in supply held by whale entities may be needed to restore the battered market confidence. The balance held by these large investors rose in tandem with the price throughout the bull run from October 2020 to April 2021.\nAlso read: Ether Price Indicator Turns Bearish for First Time Since October",

    "summary": "At the inaugural Avalanche Summit in Barcelona, Spain, the speedy Ethereum alternative looked to court users onto its subnets.",
    "content": "To the crypto-conscious, blockchain industry conferences have become annual pilgrimages of sorts, drawing each chain’s respective believers to multi-day extravaganzas in exotic locales around the world.\nThere’s the familiar Bitcoin conference (which appears to have found a home in Miami) and Ethereum’s long-running ETHDenver. Starting last autumn, new, billion-dollar base layers joined in, with Solana’s coming-out party, Breakpoint, held in Lisbon.\nDegen Chain Racks up Millions in Volumes; Latest in Custodia Bank's Legal Battle Against the Fed\nNow Avalanche has entered the fray, having just wrapped a six-day summit in Barcelona, Spain.\n“This is the first time the developers, the users, the investors can all get together,” said John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the company that supports the Avalanche blockchain. “That was the goal.”\n‘Escape velocity’\nIn the past year, Avalanche has emerged from relative obscurity to become a major challenger to Ethereum, the incumbent leader among smart-contract compatible blockchains.\nThe AVAX token returned an eye-popping 2,800% last year, breaching the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. (This year, the token has fallen about 18%.) The total valued locked (TVL) on the chain’s decentralized finance (DeFi) apps soared past $10 billion for the first time in November. It currently sits at fourth on the TVL charts, behind Ethereum, Terra and Binance Smart Chain, but above Solana.\nEven “normies” may have noticed Avalanche’s advertisements plastered across New York City subway cars, or the sea of red triangle emojis that its loyal users tout on social media.\n“Avalanche has successfully reached escape velocity,” said Darryl Wang, a conference speaker and former investor at the Three Arrows Capital offshoot DeFiance Capital. “I moved from 100% Ethereum to most other EVM-compatible chains. Now, 90% of my transactions are on Avalanche.”\nAvalanche is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning applications that are built using the Ethereum programming language Solidity are also able to deploy on Avalanche with minimal tweaking from developers.\nSo far, EVM compatibility has proven to be catalytic for upstart base layers, with Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche all courting users who are fed up with Ethereum’s high transaction fees.\nEVM compatibility may be losing its edge, however, with Terra and Solana – both unable to easily communicate with Ethereum – steadily climbing the TVL charts, a proxy for user mindshare. However, Avalanche leadership sees shared code as an advantage.\n“Solana goes with the moat strategy,” Wu told CoinDesk in an interview in Barcelona, referring to the chain that is perhaps Avalanche’s biggest competitor. “We are purposely not doing that.”\nOrigin story\nEven among the nascent, decade-old cryptocurrency industry, Avalanche’s arrival is particularly impressive – it was only founded in early 2020, making the $25 billion blockchain just over two years old.\nAvalanche is the brainchild of Emin Gün Sirer, the Turkish-born computer scientist and ex-Cornell University professor who developed much of the technology behind Avalanche. Today, Gün Sirer serves as CEO of Ava Labs.\nPerhaps most notable about Gün Sirer and the rest of Avalanche’s leaders is their institutional pedigree, particularly in an industry where teenagers, college dropouts and pseudonymous anons frequently carry outsized influence.\n“They’re definitely more seasoned,” said Aave founder Stani Kulechov of the top brass at Ava Labs. “They run the Avalanche ecosystem in a very efficient way. They’re very mission-driven, while Ethereum is more values-driven.”\nWu, who boasts not one but two Ivy League degrees, says he first met Gün Sirer through Cornell, his undergraduate alma mater, where Sirer had been a long-time professor of computer science in distributed systems, the umbrella discipline of blockchain.\n“I called up my undergrad and asked who are the best crypto people in the comp sci department,” Wu recalled. “They told me to talk to Gün.”\nIn 2017, the pair became advisers to the Cornell University Blockchain Club.\nIn crypto, founders frequently achieve deity-like status, with Bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson and Terra’s Do Kwon being leading examples. While fewer have heard of Gün Sirer, he has been called “a huge celebrity” in his native Turkey.\n“He’s a big reason why we decided to build on Avalanche,” said Mustafa Mercan, a conference attendee who, with his five-member team from The Hatch project, flew to Barcelona from Istanbul.\nInstitutions and degens alike\nAvalanche has been playing a two-pronged strategy, courting both the institutions looking to dip a toe into crypto waters, and the decentralized finance (DeFi) degenerates chasing the next 1,000% APY Ponzi protocol.\nIn the conference’s opening remarks, Gün Sirer joked that there were both “highly credentialed” and “highly questionable” people in attendance, a nod to both the institutions and degens in the room.\nAmong the institutional crowd, conference attendees included traditional financial services companies such as Deloitte and Mastercard (MA). In the more degenerate camp, there were the remnants of Wonderland’s “Frog Nation” and rabid enthusiasts of the play-to-earn crab game, Crabada.\nPerhaps the most “degen” scandal on Avalanche involved Wonderland, which grew to become one of the largest dapps on the chain before its CFO, the pseudonymous Twitter user @0xSifu, was revealed to be ex-Quadriga co-founder Michael Patryn.\n“If you compare the number of Wonderland stuff on Avalanche with what’s happening on Solana or BSC, you’ll see a smaller percentage than on other chains,” Wu said when asked about the Wonderland snafu, perhaps Avalanche’s only major PR disaster in recent memory. Rumors swirled that Wonderland founder Daniele Sestagalli was told “not to come'' to Barcelona.\nOne power user told CoinDesk that Avalanche’s retail appeal comes from its robust community and ample opportunities to make money through Avalanche’s incentive programs.\n“In general, the majority of the dapps on Avalanche are community-driven,” said Wang. “Solana is very [venture capital]-driven. If you bought a Solana token in Lisbon, you’re down bad – I guarantee it.”\nMarketing Avalanche to both retail and institutional audiences has proven to be a balancing act for Ava Labs. “You talk to a degen and they’re, like, ‘You’re a Boomercoin,’” said Wu. “When you talk to someone in TradFi, they’re, like, ‘You’re so cutting-edge.’”\nAmong the conference attendees who spoke with CoinDesk, the institutional crowd appeared less passionate about Avalanche, or perhaps for professional reasons are bound to keeping poker faces. Many institutions admitted to collaborations with multiple layer 1, or base, blockchains as a way to hedge their bets in an industry where the winners still remain unclear.\n“We’re technology agnostic,” Harold Bosse, head of product innovation at Mastercard, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We understand that there will be a multi-chain future.” Although he declined to comment on specific partnerships, Bosse said Mastercard was “very excited” to explore commercial use cases with Avalanche.\nThe crypto lending platform BlockFi echoed Mastercard’s “play the field” strategy. “We’re looking at a number of different layer 1 projects,” said BlockFi Global Head of Institutional Distribution David Olsson. “Given we need to effectively manage risk for our clients, we think it makes sense to explore not just one but several.”\nTekin Salimi, an ex-partner of Polychain Capital, a crypto venture capital firm that is very active in the Avalanche ecosystem, sees the crypto space as inherently “more collaborative” than traditional finance.\n“It’s more like we are inventing a whole new asset class, and the rising tide lifts all boats,” said Salimi, who announced his new venture fund, dao5, at the conference.\nBig incentives\nAs every smart-contract blockchain competes to onboard the Mastercards and Frog Nations, one indicator of competitiveness is the size of the war chest a project’s respective foundation can deploy to lure in users.\nIn the past eight months, Avalanche has launched four nine-figure incentive programs to bring development onto its chain, which even among base layers newly flush with cash, is particularly generous. There’s nearly $800 million in AVAX at play for everything from GameFi to Grimes.\n“The goal is on-ramping developers onto Avalanche,” said Gabriel Cardona, an Avalanche developer relations lead and one of 60 engineers with Ava Labs. “In one year, I predict we will have over a billion transactions and well over a thousand dapps.”\nCurrently, the largest dapps on Avalanche include Trader Joe, a Uniswap fork that serves as the chain’s core decentralized exchange. Another popular dapp is the play-to-earn game Crabada, Avalanche’s answer to the popular Axie Infinity.\nDespite Avalanche’s upward trajectory, critics of the blockchain point out that it doesn’t yet have a robust non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace like Ethereum’s OpenSea or Solana’s Magic Eden. Marketplaces serve as core pieces of infrastructure, and Avalanche’s dearth of an OpenSea equivalent has stifled NFT adoption on the chain.\nOther critics have pointed to the plethora of “copypasta” projects on Avalanche. To date, the most popular dapps on the chain have been forks of popular protocols like Uniswap or Ohm, or redeployments of blue-chip protocols like Aave and Curve that all first launched on Ethereum.\nSuch is the dilemma faced by many EVM-compatible chains, which are forced to choose between organically growing their own ecosystem or bootstrapping growth by courting Ethereum’s sloppy seconds.\nSo far, Avalanche still lacks a uniquely “Avalanchean” project, which even large incentive programs have failed to produce.\nSubnets\nPerhaps the most buzz at the conference centered around subnets, or networks that allow applications to establish their own customizable blockchains on Avalanche.\nSubnets allow projects on Avalanche to set the rules of their own chain – including who the validators are, which programming languages are used and who has access to the subnet. The idea is similar to Polkadot’s parachains, Cosmos’s zones and Ethereum scaling solution SKALE’s networks.\n“We have all come to the same conclusion: The way to have scalable and accessible blockchains is by making them application-specific,” said Billy Rennekamp, Cosmos Hub lead at the Interchain Foundation. While Rennekamp told CoinDesk he is a Cosmos enthusiast, he is first and foremost a proponent of cross-chain interoperability.\nAvalanche’s subnet architecture is also designed with scalability in mind, allowing computationally intensive applications to avoid clogging the main network, similar to how Axie Infinity built its own Ronin blockchain.\n“If you think about the blockchain themselves as a public database, it’s almost like every application needs its own database,” explained Josh Neuroth, head of product at Web 3 infrastructure provider Ankr. “If you want to onboard millions of users, you need your own blockchain.”\nAva Labs’ Cardona, the DevRel who also hosts a podcast called “Subnet Show,” told CoinDesk that it’s possible to “launch a subnet in 20 seconds.”\n“We want to create an institutional-friendly subnet with Avalanche and get other DeFi protocols to participate,” Aave’s Kulchev told CoinDesk. “The [know-your-customer check] happens on the subnet level once, and then you’re free to use all the protocols.”\nAave has been grappling with a bifurcation between its retail and institutional client needs, launching Aave Arc last November, a permissioned version of its popular DeFi protocol. A whitelist-only subnet, Kulchev said, could more efficiently bring DeFi to institutional investors conscious of regulatory constraints.\nJump Crypto’s President Kanav Kariya also revealed that the trading giant was “exploring a few subnets with the Avalanche team” in a keynote speech, adding the effort was “still largely explorative.”\n“In one year, the CoinMarketCap Top 100 is going to be totally different, and the primary driver will be Avalanche subnets,” said Cardona. “Finally, blockchain is maturing to live up to the promise we always envisioned. It feels very rewarding after all these years.”\nHackathon\nAfter a flurry of panel discussions, networking events and late-night tapas, a two-day, 300-person hackathon bookended the conference.\n“The focus is incredible,” Anthony Beaumont, co-founder of Encode Club, told CoinDesk at the hackathon site. “There’s even a husband-wife team that brought their baby.”\nCoinDesk spoke with a team of French college students building Clash Royale, a mobile game that allows players to bet with friends using AVAX tokens.\n“It was really challenging, we took a lot of time to find an idea,” said a sleep-deprived Bora Mindas, 22, of the hackathon experience. The team built the game on top of an existing Avalanche subnet, called WAGMI.\nAvalanche founder Gün Sirer was also spotted at the hackathon, making rounds to advise each individual team.\n“It was a nice conversation,” said Mindas, who, when asked by CoinDesk if Gün Sirer revealed any particularly juicy insights, replied with a grin, “No alpha.”\n“When I came to crypto, I saw people talking about Avalanche on Twitter,” said Mindas. “I really like the people, so I kept on building.”",

    "content": "Cronos, the Crypto.com-developed blockchain network with a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3 gaming, is providing funding and guidance for early-stage blockchain projects, it said today.\nThe Cronos Accelerator Program, funded by the $100 million Cronos Labs Ecosystem Fund, will provide investments of $100,000 to $300,000 in early-stage projects and additional grant funding for security audits, node services and gas fees. The program will also pair startups with mentors and provide weekly workshops on topics associated with protocol building. In addition, participating startups can explore investment opportunities with Cronos’ VC partners.\nCronos plans to select three or four cohorts per year, with 10 startups per cohort, to participate in the 10-week program, with the first being expected in July.\nParticipating projects can expect to raise between from $500,000 to $2 million in initial investments from Cronos labs and third-party investors, according to Cronos Managing Director Ken Timsit.\nTimsit says the startup program aims to nurture projects that appeal to users of crypto spaces.\n“We are looking for what we think Cronos users and, more broadly, the users of the crypto ecosystem, would be interested in, such as products that are easy to understand, easy to use and to unlock,” Timsit told CoinDesk.\nStartup founders don’t have to come to the program with a fully fleshed-out project, Timsit said.\n“Not all projects are fully formed, and it’s very unlikely that the project, in the end, is going to look like what the pitch deck looks like at the application stage,” Timsit told CoinDesk. “But what will make a difference is whether the founder and co-founders have a track record of figuring things out and delivering [products].”\nThe Cronos Accelerator has partnered with several companies that will support participating projects through investments, mentorship and workshops, including Mechanism Capital, Spartan Labs, IOSG Ventures, OK Blockchain Capital, AP Capital, Altcoin Buzz and Dorahacks.\nCronos has begun connecting with potential startups for the program by hosting hackathons, attending Web 3 industry events and talking about the program with their network.\nElla Qiang, vice president of Cronos, said speaking with startup founders at various industry events confirmed the company’s suspicions that many promising startups lacked the tools to execute their visions and achieve sustainable growth.\n“We realized that while many [projects] have high potential, they may not have all the tools they need to stand out and build sustainable tokenomics,” said Qiang in a press release. “We want to provide the necessary support for early-stage projects and accelerate their growth on Cronos.”",

    "summary": "Companies are predicting blockchain will be key to driving innovation and economic growth. Here’s what business leaders need to know about the technology.",
    "content": "If billion-dollar corporate investments are anything to go by, blockchain is one of the most promising technologies of the century. While it may seem difficult to understand at first, blockchain technology can be easy to grasp with the right approach, even for those who consider themselves not “tech-savvy.”\nMore than three-quarters of executives around the world think blockchain-based assets will be a \"strong alternative to or replacement for\" fiat in the next five to 10 years, according to audit firm Deloitte’s 2021 Global Blockchain Survey.\nThis article is part of Education Week. Read CoinDesk's third annual Best Universities for Blockchain Ranking.\nBut blockchain offers more than financial assets like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Companies also use it in supply chains, credential verification and ticket issuance.\nThe decision to explore and invest in blockchain “could prove as valuable as capitalizing on the internet 20 years ago across many industries. The incumbents who scoffed at the internet quickly became market laggards,” Zachary Schwartzman, blockchain investor and former Internet Analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CoinDesk.\nHere’s our guide to make sure you understand the real-world applications of the technology and how it can benefit your company.\nUnderstand enterprise blockchain and its applications\nFirst things first: Get up to speed with the basics of blockchains. Next, start to unpack what blockchain can offer for your business.\nPatrick McCorry, a researcher at blockchain developer tool provider Infura, told CoinDesk that it’s crucial for everyone interested in blockchain to understand that blockchain is a “cryptographic audit trail that allows anyone to compute a copy of the database.”\nSo maybe think of blockchain – a system of digital ledger – as a more complex, secure and interactive version of Excel. That’s why it’s so useful for payments; it’s just a matter of change in balances on the database ($10 less for you, $10 more for me). But there are also other uses, as companies around the world adopt it for their purposes.\n“While in many ways still in its infancy, blockchain technology has already demonstrated some real-world use cases for corporations and enterprises. In the payments and supply chain management spaces, for example, digital ledgers provide powerful means for decentralized tracking around the globe or creating shared databases to better record and monitor transactions in real-time,” Steve Bassi, co-founder and CEO of PolySwarm, told CoinDesk. PolySwarm is a decentralized, crowdsourced threat-intelligence-security provider.\nBrendan Playford, co-founder of Masa Finance, a decentralized financial data platform, told CoinDesk that one important use case for blockchains lies in helping “the end-to-end tracking and product-verification, from the manufacturing floor all the way to the consumer, ensuring both quality control and authentication.”\nThe real-world applications of that kind of tracking and authentication of products are easy to envision. For instance, a consortium of luxury brands including LVNM, Prada and Cartier has already launched a consortium blockchain to tackle counterfeit goods. Even whiskey and watch brands are leveraging blockchain to fight fakes.\nThat all said, another equally important question your company needs to ask is …\nDo you really need blockchain solutions?\nIt’s nice to experiment with innovations and apply new shiny technological solutions. But don’t make the mistake of creating imaginary problems that blockchain can solve. Or deciding that it’s necessary to migrate something to the blockchain just to “get on the blockchain” when current processes are working well.\nJae Yang, CEO and founder of compliance software company Tacen, told CoinDesk that blockchain could be useful as it eliminates the need for trusting counterparties. But, he said, “most companies don’t really need blockchains. It depends on whether there could be a high probability over the dispute of records, such as land titles or loan agreements.”\nFor businesses that regularly deal with those issues, when a dispute arises the blockchain will already have everything related to it on record, eliminating the need for going through terms and bureaucracy.\n“For supply chain questions, if it’s all vertically integrated at your company, then what’s the point of having a blockchain-based system here? There has to be an incentive here. If it’s just a few parties you’re dealing with along the supply chain, then maybe you don’t need a blockchain,” he suggests.\nDecide whether to prioritize decentralization\nIf you’ve decided that a blockchain solution will truly benefit your company, the next thing to figure out is what to prioritize in that solution.\nThe main consideration here is usually to decide if decentralization or efficiency is more important, as one often comes at the expense of the other. This prioritization is one reason why some companies choose to utilize a private, consortium or hybrid model of blockchain.\nYou can read more about the pros and cons of each here: What are the four types of blockchains?\n“The issue facing companies more and more now is the blockchain trilemma – decentralization, throughput and security. Right now public blockchains haven’t fully solved for the trilemma, so companies that want to incorporate some form of blockchain-based supply chain management system or payments system are going to have to make some compromises,” Jack Saracco, co-founder and chief business development officer of digital bank Ping, told CoinDesk.\nSome companies prefer decentralization, Saracco explained, but many others naturally want to prioritize high performance that results in greater throughput. Other companies want to avoid solutions involving high fees and slow transaction times. Finally, some companies need to preserve private data on the blockchain and so will need to sacrifice decentralization in favor of security.\nOnce you’ve figured out your priorities, you can make a blockchain choice – and no, you don’t need to build it yourself.\nYou don’t need to build your own blockchain\nCompanies like proprietary software. Although private custom-made blockchains were briefly popular among companies in the last decade, there’s been a shift to embracing public blockchains.\n“There was a time when you saw a lot of public companies trying to manage supply chain issues using permissioned – or private – blockchains, and that push sort of faded away,” Masa Finance’s Playford told CoinDesk. “Increasingly, it has become clear that public blockchains are close to providing the necessary trustless infrastructure and transaction efficiency necessary for enabling enterprise applications.”\nIsmael Fleing, co-founder of luxury conglomerate Arity, told CoinDesk that the blockchain industry has “an excellent mindset of collaboration,” and his company chose to collaborate with a technical partner. “There is already progress made by a lot of companies on this technology; you don't have to build your own blockchain to be able to use its benefits. … That's what we did with Everledger; they focused on the making of the technology and helped us understand the technicalities of the blockchain so that we could focus our ideas.” Arity uses blockchain to provide traceability and to show customers the stories behind their unique pieces of jewelry, immortalizing them on the blockchain.\nFind and promote technically minded employees\nWho should be the blockchain person at your company?\nSchwartzman suggests that companies “elevate the smartest technical employee who has spent their weekends learning about crypto economics and various implementations of permissionless chains (i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Starkware, etc.) to their senior management teams.” This is because blockchain – and the crypto industry at large – takes serious time to grasp, and those already committed to it will be the most appropriate employees for this task.\nComposability of data enabled by permissionless blockchains like Ethereum and layer 2, or companion, blockchains will offer the most business value derived from blockchain technology, Schwartzman believes. “Therefore, technical executives should spend time learning about permissionless blockchains,” he told CoinDesk. “I could be wrong, but I have yet to see permissioned blockchains marketed for enterprises and championed by external consultants drive business value that a shared database couldn’t.”\nGet your hands dirty\nHow should you – or your designated employees – go about learning more about the blockchain? Nothing beats practical experience.\n“Do stuff. Create a wallet, burn ETH, mint stuff and live on Twitter, Discord and Reddit,” Dimitri Tsamados, a technology growth company expert and partner at Eric Salmon & Partners, told CoinDesk. He also recommends a blockchain course, like the one offered for free by the University of Nicosia. Companies could also benefit from incubators like Outlier, he said.\nFor aspiring startup builders, there’s plenty of high-quality resources available. Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has made course videos from its Crypto Startup School 2020 available to all.\nThe industry lives both on the blockchain but also in many conferences around the world, where companies can make connections and learn more about the industry. McCorry suggests attending at least one conference. The connections and ideas that come out of in-person panels, roundtables and casual conversations amongst attendees are invaluable for any executive who wants to understand not only the technology but the culture and energy in cryptocurrency and blockchain.",

    "summary": "Once the split takes place, the protocol will be led by a coalition connected to the EOS Network Foundation, following the foundation’s separation from Block.one.",
    "content": "The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) said Wednesday that Antelope will be used as the underlying protocol for EOSIO-based blockchains. Antelope, a community-run blockchain protocol, will be supported by members of the ENF, which include EOS, Telos, Wax, and UX Network.\nAccording to Zack Gall, vice president of communications at the ENF, the hard fork of the code of the EOSIO blockchain is slated for Sept. 21, which is when the official switch over to Antelope will take place. Because this is a hard fork, all member computers, or nodes, will have to upgrade in order to continue to run on the new protocol.\nEOSIO in jeopardy\nThis all comes as ENF has decided to pursue legal action against Block.one, the entity that originally designed the EOS network, over malpractice concerns. In 2021, Block.one stopped supporting EOISO development, putting the blockchain in jeopardy. ENF thus started to develop initiatives during the fall of 2021 to explore the possibilities of coordinating EOSIO-based blockchains and to preserve and advance the codebase they share.\nThe ENF organized to fork the EOSIO code base to initiate a project labeled “Mandel.” Mandel was handed over to EOSIO developers to work on technical improvements and formalize a consensus upgrade. Mandel came to be a placeholder for the yet-to-be-decided brand to replace EOSIO. When the ENF introduced Antelope as this project, it retired Mandel.\nGall told CoinDesk, “The code was already forked back in February by the ENF and we've already added many new features and capabilities to that code, which today became known as Antelope.” He added that “the code has been running on testnets for a while” in advance of the hard fork next month.\nThe use of Antelope as the underlying blockchain is significant, since support for EOSIO (EOS) was discontinued by Block.one. Antelope will thus be taking charge of rejuvenating the community.\nWhat is Antelope?\nAntelope is an open framework blockchain and a community-run codebase. It uses a Delegated Proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model, which evolved from proof-of-stake, where users of the network vote and elect delegates to validate the next block. Under DPoS, delegates are referred to as block producers.\nDevelopers use Antelope for a diverse range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and games. The Antelope Coalition has already made Requests for Proposals, including proposals addressing faster finality, software development kits (SKDs), and peer-to-peer code improvements.\nIn a press release, Yves La Rose, CEO and executive director of the EOS Network Foundation, said, “We are building upon over four years of battle-hardened code, and the cumulative knowledge of four [layer 1 blockchains] leveraging each other’s strengths, all united behind the Antelope protocol.”\nThe price of EOS, the native cryptocurrency of the EOSIO blockchain, had risen nearly 20% over the past 24 hours to $1.65 before dropping down to $1.49 at time of publication.\nRead more: EOS Community Weighs Legal Action Against Block.one, Seeking $4.1B",

That suggests price-insensitive traders hold much of bitcoin's supply above the $40,000 price level.\nSo far, long-term price momentum has deteriorated, so it remains to be seen if traders will continue to find attractive buying points between $35,000 and $42,000. From a technical perspective, a breakout or breakdown of the current price range is needed to confirm a shift in trend.\nThe chart below shows a volume profile of bitcoin's year-long price range.

    "summary": "The move comes weeks after THORChain’s native blockchain went live on seven supported networks.",
    "content": "THORChain has activated a “killswitch” that will eventually phase out rune (RUNE) based on the Ethereum blockchain and BNB Chain in favor of rune issued on its native blockchain.\n“The BEP-2 and ERC-20 $RUNE killswitch will be activated at block 6500000. Upgrades will no longer be 1:1,” developers said in a tweet Monday. BEP-2 and ERC20 refer to tokens issued atop the BNB Chain and Ethereum networks, respectively.\nThe killswitch will reduce the redemption rate of the BNB Chain-based rune (BNB.RUNE) and Ethereum-based rune (ETH.RUNE) from 1:1 to 1:0 over the next year.\nThat means 1 BNB.RUNE presented after six months of the killswitch will be redeemed only for 0.5 THOR.RUNE, and after one year, it will be redeemed for 0.0 THOR.RUNE, which means the token is effectively entirely deprecated.\nRUNE was, so far, issued on the BNB Chain and Ethereum networks as an IOU, meaning the tokens were redeemable for an equivalent value of THORChain-based assets. Users acquired the tokens 18 months before the launch of its multichain testing network, “Chaosnet.”\nAnyone could have acquired enough RUNE to run a \"THORNode,\" which processes transactions on and validates the THORChain network.\nDevelopers, however, explained earlier this year that BNB.RUNE and ETH.RUNE, the two IOU tokens, allowed third parties to create new tokens using THORChain’s “mint” function, which made THORChain dependent on the two networks.\n“Six months ago, a white hat found a critical vulnerability, that was *almost* exploited but swiftly prevented, around this mint functionality on Binance Chain,” developers pointed out at the time. “ETH.RUNE also has unfavorable characteristics for long-term holders, being the transferTo() function, which makes it easy for users to be phished.”\nMoving the tokens to THORChain’s native network makes the network less susceptible to exploits, the developers said.\nMeanwhile, THORChain developers said in Monday’s tweet that several large exchanges that have listed BNB.RUNE haven't made the switch to THORChain-issued rune yet.\n“This has created two separate markets for RUNE and one that is both unnecessary, and problematic, since it slows adoption of the network,” they said. “These exchanges have not yet been given an imperative to switch to native RUNE.\nTHORChain allows users to trade bitcoin (BTC) for any other supported asset without the use of bridges or wrapped assets. Bridges are software that allows users to transfer coins among different blockchains.\nThe protocol now supports swaps between seven major tokens, including bitcoin, ether (ETH), binance coin (BNB), dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and rune. Support for cosmos (ATOM) and avalanche (AVAX) is expected in the coming months.",

Both are in the top 50 technology schools globally, according to QS World University Rankings, and are known in Asia for their strong science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs.\nKlaytn, introduced by messaging app Kakao's blockchain arm Ground X, went live in 2019 and now has \"millions of users in Korea,\" it said. Its KLAY token has over $880 million in market cap, according to CoinGecko data, making it the 66th largest cryptocurrency. Its governing body at launch included electronics giant LG, with crypto exchange Binance and South Korea's Shinhan Bank joining later.\nBRC will operate in an open-source manner, where research conducted will be publicly disclosed as research papers or open-source software. External researchers will be able to participate in existing research projects or submit their own proposals.\nSeo said KAIST and NUS were selected from a pool of participating research institutes who submitted a proposal. Seven proposals were received from 62 research institutes in 11 countries, Seo said. The KAIST and NUS research group was selected by the Klaytn Governance Council.\nCORRECTION (Aug. 10, 07:26 UTC): Clarifies that the fund was not awarded exclusively to the two named schools. They are helping run the program.",

The idea is to reduce latency when downloading data from remote locations, such as the moon, said Marta Belcher, the head of policy and general counsel at Protocol Labs.\nProtocol Labs, a key player in the Filecoin ecosystem, is the original developer behind IPFS' code.\n\"[We're] redesigning a lot of the technologies [that] just aren't ready to work in space,\" Belcher said at Monday's event.\nJoe Landon, vice president of advanced programs development at Lockheed, said the move is meant to anticipate an emerging \"space economy.\"\n\"In the future, we'll have one satellite refueling another. That's a transaction that takes place entirely in space that doesn't really have a nexus back on Earth. Decentralization makes sense for that,\" Landon said.\nMoreover, at present, satellites interact mainly with servers on Earth, but the vast distances of space mean instructions sent to objects orbiting the moon or Mars won't arrive for several minutes. That could be forever if urgent instructions or data needs to be shared.\nHaving satellites able to act as relays for this kind of data would reduce this latency, he said.",

    "summary": "Dormant supply peaks are springboards for upwards price action, one observer said.",
    "content": "The view that bitcoin's (BTC) fate is closely tied to what the U.S. Federal Reserve does has been widely discussed. As a result, most traders looking to time the next parabolic bull run are waiting for the world's most powerful central bank to declare victory over inflation and abandon liquidity tightening.\nWhile the Fed decisions are undoubtedly important, indicators unrelated to macroeconomic factors and unique to the crypto market, like coin dormancy metrics, could be equally valuable in timing the next bull run.\n\"Dormant supply peaks are springboards for upwards price action,\" Nik Bhatia, author of the best-selling book \"Layered Money,\" and market analyst Joe Consorti wrote in the latest edition of The Bitcoin Layer newsletter.\nBhatia concluded that after noting bitcoin's tendency to chalk out sharp multi-month rallies after the percent of circulating supply inactive for at least a year has peaked.\nAs seen in the featured image, the percentage of supply that was inactive for at least a year topped in January 2016 and the peak preceded a major 21-month bull run that saw prices rise from $450 to $20,000 – a staggering 4,340% rally.\nSimilarly, bitcoin went berserk after the metric peaked in the third quarter of 2020, rallying from $10,000 to over $60,000 in six months to April 2021.\nAt press time, the percentage of bitcoin dormant for at least a year stood at a record 65.76%, according to data sourced from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\nIf history is a guide, bitcoin may see another meteoric rally once the metric has peaked.\n\"If two-thirds of bitcoin is off the market (not for sale) for an extremely long period of time, the price is driven up when more buyers enter the market bidding for a finite supply – a scenario that has played out in bitcoin twice before,\" Bhatia noted, adding that there are more unspent one-year plus old coins than ever before.\nOn-chain data has its own set of limitations and the metric in consideration doesn't take into account fast-growing bitcoin-linked trading vehicles such as derivatives, tokenized bitcoin, exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded products and trusts. Coins locked in these alternative vehicles are still liquid or active, even if they don't appear to be in on-chain metrics.\nNevertheless, the relationship between inactive supply and price trends is noteworthy.\n\"Is this causal or circumstantial? We don’t know. But when data moves in inverse-tandem in previous cycles, it catches our eye and demands attention,\" Bhatia said.\nBitcoin changed hands at $19,750 at press time, down 0.5% on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data.",

    "content": "Polygon has deployed Avail, a scaling system designed for developers to launch their blockchain applications atop the main Polygon chain and other blockchains.\nAvail lead developer Anurag Arjun told CoinDesk the new product would allow developers to access blockchain data “off-chain,” meaning they would not need to continually check data from the network for an application deployed on Polygon.\nApplications built on Avail would give developers the ability to update, fork and change how their blockchains handle execution.\n“This is critical for [decentralized finance] and game developers that may need to patch bugs, experiment with execution or just reduce their dependencies on external chains,” Arjun told CoinDesk.\nThe product is intended to address “data availability” problems faced by scaling applications, he said. This is a complex problem faced by blockchain developers: How are nodes sure about when a new block is produced, all of the data in that block was actually published to the network? There’s no way to detect malicious transactions hidden within that block in case a block producer doesn’t release all of the data of that block.\nAvail uses advanced mathematical techniques to assess blockchain data provided by node operators to determine the authenticity of data, without needing to rely on all node operators to verify the data.\n“Availability can be determined by only downloading a very small random sample of the total data, effectively solving the data availability problem,” Arjun told CoinDesk.\nCurrently, so-called \"monolithic\" blockchains, such as Ethereum, can not scale as there are too many tasks to perform (execution, settlement, and data availability). Scaling products, such as Avail, focus on just one part of the application requests at a time to speed up transactions.\nAvail can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain. EVM refers to the software platform that developers can use to create decentralized applications (dapps) on Ethereum.",

Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of third parties, while layer 2 is the system built on top of blockchains in order to process more data.\n“By launching on Optimism, we aim to make DeFi more accessible, scalable and reliable as the protocol-to-protocol liquidity backbone,” explained Puff, lead contributor to the Iron Bank, in a statement to CoinDesk.\nIn recent months, Optimism has become one of the most used layer 2 platforms due to its speed and low user fees. Data shows that applications built on the network locked over $320 million worth of cryptocurrencies in January 2022, which has increased to over $1 billion as of Tuesday.\nEthereum fees become prohibitively expensive for users during times of high network demand, with network fees touching as much as $9,000 per transaction during one such period earlier this year. This is why building on networks like Optimism allows DeFi projects to be more accessible to users, explained Dark Ghosty, integrations lead of Yearn Finance.\n“We're excited about Optimism for the users who were priced out of yVaults on Ethereum,” he said. “With the additional liquidity flexibility that Iron Bank provides as a protocol-to-protocol lending partner, people can get the best risk-adjusted yield in DeFi without having to worry about high gas costs on a super-fast chain.”\nIron Bank said it would initially start to offer rewards for users that supply weighted ether (wETH), USDC and DAI assets, with approximately 11,500 iron bank (IB) tokens allocated for rewards over the next four weeks\nAdditionally, Iron Bank has initiated a bug bounty and insurance campaign with ImmuneFI and Nexus Mutual.

    "summary": "A group of Fortune 500 companies is teaming up with blockchain startups to develop a protocol that will integrate IoT devices and blockchain tech.",
    "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT) – the vast web of connected devices which is becoming a fundamental part of the technological infrastructure that surrounds us – brings both huge potential and great risk.\nOn the plus side, the transition from ‘dumb’ to ‘smart’ devices represents a sea change in the way we think about automation and responsiveness in the products around us: cars which drive themselves, apartments which become self-regulating environments, and appliances which optimise automatically for each user’s unique preferences.\nBut as a consequence, every connected device is another attack surface for a hacker to target, and significant concerns have been expressed about the growing number of IoT devices which have been weaponised into botnets or used as surveillance tools.\nEvidence of these high-profile breaches means that attempts to increase trust and security between IoT devices are crucial – so it’s big news that a group of Fortune 500 companies from the hardware and software industries is joining with a team of blockchain startups to develop a protocol that will connect the dots between IoT devices and blockchain technology.\nThe initiative was born out of the New Horizons: Blockchain x IoT Summit in Berkeley, California, in December 2016 – a meeting that brought together startups Ambisafe, BitSE, Chronicled, ConsenSys, Distributed, Filament, Hashed Health, Ledger, Skuchain and Slock.it, and major corporations BNY Mellon, Bosch, Cisco, Gemalto and Foxconn.\nDiscussed at the event were the challenges facing blockchain and IoT innovation, and the potential for a collective effort to address them.\nMany of the larger corporations have already expressed strong interest in Internet of Things technology. For example, Bosch’s most recent annual report, the 2015 review titled Simply.Connected, set out a vision to be “one of the world’s leading IoT companies” by focusing on sensor technology, software and services, while Cisco, known for making networking equipment, has a clear interest in being at the forefront of embedded networking.\nBut the interest in blockchain represents a more recent direction: electronics manufacturers like Foxconn, for example, have not historically been associated with this field. So what are the challenges and opportunities that have led them to team up with blockchain startups?\nThe need for trust\nIn the manufacturing space, big business has already shown interest in using blockchain technology in supply chain logistics, where cryptographic signatures can be used to assure the identity of items at each stage of transit and after sale (Chronicled, a member of the consortium, has compiled a list of case studies of this kind).\nFor Internet-enabled devices, identity verification becomes even more important for manufacturers, since they will be sending and receiving data across a larger network. Even when devices are trusted, the integrity of data sent between them still needs to be validated; hence the gains that can be made by signing and confirming data at each stage of the way.\nOne of the larger companies involved, digital security provider Gemalto, has worked on secure machine-to-machine (M2M) communication for the past 10 years, and is now applying this experience to the newer field of blockchain technology.\nJoe Pindar, director of product strategy and CTO at Gemalto, told CoinDesk that the intention is to build an abstraction layer such that a handful of core functions that IoT vendors might need – for example, registering new devices or changing ownership – can be implemented in such a way that the code can be used with different blockchains.\n\"It means that a new IoT startup can concentrate on building their app and getting the core value of the integrity that blockchain delivers, but at some point in the future if they decide that their first choice, say bitcoin, wasn't the right way to go, they can switch to ethereum and it doesn't hurt them,\" Pindar said.\nThe upshot of this is that once the protocol is released, new startups will be able to build products around it in a standardised way without needing to put time and resources into developing bespoke solutions each time.\nBeyond the barcode\nAccording to Ryan Orr, CEO of Chronicled, the development of the blockchain/IoT protocol can be seen as the next phase in a technological pathway that started with the barcode, the original digital product identifier.\n“The barcode was a simple and unique system that led to huge improvements in the retail industry,” Orr said. “Unfortunately the system was not secure, so you have trillions of dollars of counterfeiting today ... Once we have a secure system of identity that’s open and interoperable, I think the implications will be as big as the barcode over 10 to 20 years.”\nBesides product identifiers, the consortium also sees big potential in a protocol that will connect the IoT with the functionality of smart contracts.\nSlock.it, another consortium member and developer of the much discussed DAO, focuses on use cases meant to facilitate sharing economy services without needing a middleman: for example, using smart contracts and an Internet-enabled lock to let guests into an apartment in an Airbnb-style rental.\nIn a statement, Dirk Slama, chief alliance officer at Bosch Software Innovations, said:\nFuture announcements outlining a timeline for the project will follow, but members are optimistic that results will emerge quickly.\nOrr said:\nSmart environmental sensors image via Bosch Software Innovations",

    "title": "Zennet to Pay for Distributed Computing With Blockchain Tech",
    "summary": "Zennet promises to bring decentralisation and supercomputing together, enabling people to charge for their unused CPU and GPU cycles.",
    "content": "For several years now, kindly volunteers have been contributing their spare computing power to vast, distributed supercomputers, all in the name of worthy causes.\nSpare computing cycles have been used for everything from scanning cosmic radio signals for signs of extraterrestrial life through to calculating climate change scenarios. Now, a new project hopes to let people charge for their spare computing cycles.\nTraditionally, in a community grid project, one central resource (such as SETI@Home) co-ordinates thousands of volunteer computers in a cloud, relying on people giving up their computing cycles for free. After all, it has been practically impossible for people to charge for them – until now.\nZennet\nis a distributed supercomputing project that will use blockchain technology to remove the central administrators from the problem. Instead, it will be a completely decentralised system, according to its founder, software engineer Ohad Asor.\nAsor calls it a market for computational power, in which many different jobs would be distributed among many different computers, with no middleman taking commission or co-ordinating things.\nHow Zennet will work\nPublishers provide jobs ripe for large-scale distribution, which would typically be the kinds of workloads used in Hadoop, the open source project used for the distributed processing of large data sets (you'll often see Hadoop and 'big data' used in the same context).\nPublishers distribute information about those jobs on the network. Software operated by providers – owners of computers with spare computing power – will contact the publishers, and automatically negotiate a price for their part in the job.\nAnyone can be a provider, as long as their computer is capable of running the Zennet client. Every computer has spare computational cycles, in between each rest break, cup of coffee and keystroke, which could be used by a provider.\nThe key concept behind Zennet is that publishers' jobs are designed to be distributed among hundreds or thousands of providers, each of whom take on a tiny proportion of the job.\nAsor said:\nNeed for speed\nManaging thousands of agreements with as many different providers is no mean feat. That's where blockchain technology will come in, Asor said.\nPublishers will announce their jobs on the blockchain and providers will search the public ledger for those jobs. They negotiate the contract directly, then the publisher commits a specific amount in funds to the blockchain.\nThe provider starts work, and the publisher controls the work on the provider's computer. Once the work is done, the funds on the blockchain can be released.\nAsor would have liked to have used bitcoin's blockchain for the system, but it is too slow, he said.\n\"I have been thinking about the coin algorithm for a long time. It has to be a secure coin, and fast,\" he explained. \"If you did it over bitcoin, when you ordered a computational job it might take half an hour until it begins. That is unacceptable.\"\nThe potential slowness is because of a payment method that Xennet needs to function effectively as the jobs completed are likely to be small, Providers would be paid off-chain, using the micropayments protocol already outlined in the bitcoin wiki. Setting up that micropayments channel takes a confirmation on the blockchain.\n\"To initiate a micropayment channel, it is necessary to deposit money in a multisig address, and the other party has to wait for confirmations of this deposit,\" says Zennet's explanatory literature.\nKey decisions\nInstead, Asor proposes an alternative blockchain and cryptocurrency, called XenCoin, which would be used to pay for computational work. He suggests a fixed amount of coin at the start of the Zennet project, rather than ongoing mining.\n\"They are both good solutions, as far as I can tell, but we take more time to decide on these things because we really want to come with the most secure thing possible,\" Asor said.\nHe'd better get a move-on, as the presale for the Zennet network was supposed to happen in November. Although Asor says that the lawyers are still working it out. \"It's always in a few days,\" he said.\nAttractive proposition?\nIn any case, why would people want XenCoins in exchange for their work? If they are used to pay for large-scale computing resources, and the average desktop PC owner doesn't have a whole bunch of 3D raytracing to do, then it's difficult to see why they'd bother spending computational power in return for a token like this.\n\"The formal answer for legal reasons is, I don’t care how you redeem XenCoins,\" said Asor. But what about if an exchange offered to trade them for fiat currency? \"That's the informal answer,\" he joked.\nThere's still a lot of fundamental work to be done in areas such as consensus algorithms before Zennet goes live. However, Asor says that around a quarter of the coding has been done.\nIf the concept can be made to fly, then it'll be an interesting example of how blockchain technology opens up hitherto unexploitable markets.\nQuite how the folks relying on volunteers to search the skies or predict future climate chaos will feel about all of that is another thing entirely.\nDecentralisation image via Shutterstock.",

    "content": "Bitcoin wallet provider MultiBit has passed an important milestone – its one millionth download.\nIn fact, since nobody was actually keeping track, their one-million milestone came and went without anyone noticing and the current figure is much higher.\nWhen the MultiBit team was recently asked how many downloads had occurred since launch, they crunched a few numbers to reveal that the wallet had in fact been downloaded a total of 1,517,000 times since April 2011. The team pointed out:\nMultiBit also said that it does not have records from the early days when it was only used by the bitcoinj mailing list. However, the team believes that the download figures for this period were below 100 per month.\nVersion 2.0\nThe MultiBit development team is currently working hard on the next version of the wallet app, dubbed MultiBit HD.\nMultiBit HD is designed for mainstream bitcoin users across the world, but there is still no word on the launch date, or which new features are to be integrated.\nMultiBit is one of the few bitcoin wallets to feature support for multiple languages and, in its latest release, it supports more than 35.\nThe wallet is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and is free to use – although it is 'donation ware', with the team suggesting a donation of 0.01 BTC from those who find it useful.\nAhead of the competition\nOddly enough, with 1.5m downloads, MultiBit seems to have shifted significantly more wallets than Blockchain.info and Coinbase, which both recently announced the passing of their one-million wallet milestones.\nBoth MultiBit and Blockchain.info saw a massive spike in the number of downloads in the second half of 2013.\nBlockchain started the year with fewer than 100,000 wallets and ended it with about a million.

    "summary": "Infuriated by Apple's Blockchain app ban, bitcoiners smashed their iPhones in a controversial show of community support.",
    "content": "Infuriated by Apple's sudden move to ban bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain from its App stores on Wednesday, the bitcoin community flocked to reddit today in a spirited and controversial showing of support for the virtual currency.\nReddit posts abounded decrying Apple's move as an anti-competitive maneuver that positions the Cupertino company against innovation and its core values.\nHowever, there may be no more dedicated bitcoin supporter than Ryan of the YouTube video series Ryan's Range Report, a vlogger and long-range shooting devotee who found a rare combination of his passions when he blasted his iPhone 4S to pieces to voice his displeasure with Apple's decision.\nThe gesture was not unprompted, however, as it was in response to a reddit post by user round-peg, who engaged the reddit's bitcoin community with a unique proposition. For every 100 upvotes his post received, round-peg indicated that he would \"gift someone a Nexus 5 for a video of them smashing their iPhone\".\nAt press time, the post had received more than 2,400 upvotes, and 1,037 comments. Though, notably, round-peg's account was no longer accessible. Round-peg was likely banned for his open solicitation of upvoting, which was in violation of reddit's rules.\nRules of engagement\nRound-peg did put a cap on his philanthropy, noting in his post that his offer would extend for \"up to 500 upvotes (5 devices)\", and that new phones would be distributed on a \"first-come, first serve\" basis. The user eventually expanded this limit to include six videos.\nRound-peg also listed the criteria videos needed to meet to be eligible, which was taken down and later reposted:\nThe reddit user also posted a number of additional considerations that he felt participants should take into account before creatively discarding their iPhones. Interestingly, round-peg takes his name from a famous Apple commercial:\niPhone fury unleashed\nWhatever response roung-peg expected, it was clear that the offer struck a chord in a community that felt betrayed by a company many had come to view as the preeminent voice in the tech industry.\nUser netpastor took round-peg up on this offer, posting a two-minute video of himself reading round-peg's conditions and ultimately smashing his iPhone 5 with a metal bar.\n\"This is a game changing decision on Apple's part, and the Bitcoin community won't take it lying down. I'm not a spokesperson, just someone who's very unhappy with this dishonorable action by Apple,\" netpastor, who goes by the YouTube name Boanerges, wrote in the post.\nRound-peg followed up this show of support, with a comment indicating that the replacement phone had been purchased as promised.\nUser upgradesolution voiced his support with what appeared to be a tire iron.\n\"I'm about to destroy my iPhone 5 32G, because Apple has decided to block bitcoin apps on their app store.\"\nReddit user OscarChapa_ felt similarly, also citing Apple's stance toward the NSA as a factor.\n\"Apple has decided to effectively block any advances in bitcoin and any sort of cryptocurrency, and for a company that promotes any kind of futurism, that is not acceptable,\" he said before taking a machete to his device.\nUser Downhill280Z took a more soft-spoken approach, dropping his iPhone down a flight of stairs.\nUser huskyminers chose the wrench as his weapon of choice:\nControversy\nStacy Herbert, co-host of the Keiser Report on RT, told CoinDesk that the community reaction is a strong sign that Apple's policies are beginning to alienate core users.\n\"This decision will ultimately have a bigger negative impact on Apple than it will on bitcoin. Once you become as uncool as Microsoft, it's hard to ever get that groove back. Apple's mistake, however, will be someone else's gain. I would think that immediately, for example, Android smartphones will be the big winner. And we see that with the smashing iPhone videos,\" Herbert said.\nThough some community members chose to view the events as a show of support in the face of Apple's seemingly staunch resistance to bitcoin, others were less amused.\nSome redditors suggested that the contest was in poor spirit and that it reflected negatively on bitcoin and the wider community.\nWhat's your opinion of the iPhone smashings?

    "summary": "Blockchain.info has acquired the company behind popular mobile app ZeroBlock, in a deal done entirely in bitcoin.",
    "content": "The world's most popular bitcoin site and online wallet, Blockchain.info, today announced it has acquired ZeroBlock LLC, makers of the leading mobile bitcoin app.\nZeroBlock's developer, Dan Held, will also join the Blockchain team as a Product Manager.\nReleased in summer 2013, ZeroBlock has become one of the most popular mobile and web apps for bitcoin enthusiasts. It combines live Bitcoin exchange data with up to the minute breaking news and charts, both on mobile devices and its website ZeroBlock.com.\nIt displays prices in bitcoin's three most-traded currencies (CNY, USD, EUR) with up-to-date data from the largest exchanges (BTC China, Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Coinbase). There are also statistics for miners such as block times, hash rates and difficulty increases. A basic grayscale version of the app is free to download on iOS, and users who donate $2 can see charts and graphs in color.\nAs of December 2013, ZeroBlock is the most-reviewed and highest-rated bitcoin app on the Apple iOS App Store. It is on track to surpass 1,000,000 impressions (people opening the app) in the month of December and in the same month has been downloaded 9,000 times. In November it launched a version for Android, gaining thousands more users.\nBlockchain said ZeroBlock fits in with its \"very ambitious future goals in the bitcoin space,\" and will play a pivotal role in helping bitcoin users follow market trends and hopefully open up new revenue sources.\n“What Dan Held and Kevin Johnson have accomplished is truly remarkable. ZeroBlock has created an enduring design aesthetic that elegantly filters the signal from the noise in the bitcoin ecosystem. I’m completely obsessed with it.”\nThough Blockchain is keeping the price of the acquisition confidential, in keeping with its image as a \"non-fiat company\" the deal was done entirely in bitcoin.\nBoth Blockchain and ZeroBlock have experienced massive growth in the past couple of months, as bitcoin's value and appeal suddenly skyrocketed. The companies have taken a more analytical approach to bitcoin, presenting its statistical nuances to the public in a well-designed way to make it approachable to newcomers and professional analysts.\n\"I want entrepreneurs to know that we're serious about seeing their projects succeed, and we're looking to form partnerships with bitcoin thought leaders,\" Cary concluded.\nFeatured image: Janitors / Flickr",

    "summary": "Blockchain.info is offering refunds to users who had bitcoins stolen as a result of a recent flaw.",
    "content": "Another bug has been discovered in a bitcoin wallet, leading to the theft of around 50 bitcoins. This time, Blockchain.info's web wallet was at fault, and the company is now offering refunds to users who lost bitcoins due to the flaw.\nThe popular Blockchain website primarily offers market data and serves as the main block chain explorer for the bitcoin currency. However, users can also create web-based wallets to send and receive bitcoins. The bug lies in the random number generator that the web wallet uses to sign bitcoin transactions. The random numbers are generated in web browsers using the JavaScript programming language. It was discovered on Monday, when a bitcoin user reported that he had 1.8 BTC (around $223) stolen.\n\"Funds from other addresses in this wallet were not affected. This leads me on thoughts that Blockchain.info or Firefox may have some weakness in random number generator like the vulnerability was recently found in the Android, [sic]\" he said.\nThis bug follows another random generator flaw found in the Android operating system earlier this month. That flaw affected the generation of private keys for bitcoin addresses. The repetition of random numbers enabled attackers to determine the private keys of users' wallets, which in turn enabled them to take ownership of the bitcoin addresses associated with those keys.\nMultiple Android clients were affected by that flaw (including Blockchain.info's client, for which it issued a patch). But this latest flaw affected Blockchain.info's browser client, its Chrome and Firefox extensions, and its Mac OSX app.\nUnlike the Android bug, this flaw only affected the signing of transactions, rather than the creation of private keys, confirmed Blockchain's Ben Reeves (aka Piuk) on the Bitcointalk forum. Firefox was particularly vulnerable to a poor seeding of its random number generator, he added.\n\"Unlike the Android issue the RNG [random number generator] used to generate private keys was not affected so wallets do not need to be re-keyed,\" Reeves told CoinDesk. \"As long as your client is up to date for future transactions you will not be at risk.\"\nBlockchain.info has now patched the bug. Users must make sure they are using the following client version numbers:\nAlso, those who just use the web wallet (without a plugin) should clear their browser cache before using the Blockchain website.\nAnother forum user advised USA-based forum members that there is possible legal redress via federal laws against criminal wire fraud.\nWhen asked about the identity of the attacker(s), Reeves confirmed that the attacker is an individual and that all stolen funds have been sent to the following address: 1HKywxiL4JziqXrzLKhmB6a74ma6kxbSDj.\nSignificantly, funds transferred to that account also include funds taken from Android users earlier this month, suggesting that the same person could be behind the theft of bitcoins using both bugs.\nFor those looking to recover lost funds, Reeves told us: \"If someone thinks they have had funds stolen, if it is due to this bug it is very likely the coins will have been sent to the above address. If in doubt they can contact help@blockchain.info and I will investigate further. Only a couple of BTC have been refunded so far.\"\nReeves hinted at a glimmer of hope for lost funds: \"It depends on [the attacker's] intentions, but there is still a possibility they might return the funds.\" But the prevailing message is: don't bank on it.\nA Blockchain.info representative said that Reeves had issued the (aforementioned) patches within hours of the flaw being detected, and added: \"This is a truly amazing turnaround time.\"\nA list of the addresses affected by the random number generator bugs on both Blockchain and Android were published on the Bitcoin forum, and has also been updated with new finds. He told us: \"If someone thinks their money was stolen due to this exploit, they should check if their bitcoin address is on the list. If it is, contact us at: https://blockchain.info/support-desk. If it isn't, then you were not a victim of this exploit.\"\nHave you lost bitcoins? Have you been refunded? Let us know in the comments.",

    "summary": "A researcher who swept (and returned) 267 BTC from Blockchain wallets has told CoinDesk how and why he did it.",
    "content": "UPDATE (15th December 11:15 GMT): Hacker johoe's transaction history indicates he has received a further 244.2 BTC from compromised Blockchain wallets since 8.23pm yesterday evening (GMT).\nWhen contacted by CoinDesk, Blockchain president Peter Smith confirmed that johoe's funds had been taken from the same wallet addresses as before. This indicates that certain users are unaware of the hack or have continued to use their compromised wallets despite the company's warnings, he said.\nJohoe has been contacted for further comment on the issue.\nThe 'Good Samaritan' hacker who recently returned 267 BTC he took from compromised Blockchain wallets has revealed how he was able to collect the funds and given advice to bitcoin holders wanting to secure their money.\nThe computer scientist and researcher, who goes by the handle 'johoe' on Bitcoin Talk, told CoinDesk that each day he runs a script he has written that scans recently added data from the bitcoin blockchain and looks for repeated 'R values'.\nHe said:\nJohoe has been posting examples of such 'broken' addresses on Bitcoin Talk for over a year.\nSpate of broken keys\nUpon running the script last Monday morning, he said he recognized immediately that it had found something. The script, which had discovered only about 500 such 'broken' keys in the bitcoin blockchain's five-year history, had suddenly unveiled 500 more in a single day.\nA second script he wrote scanned the public ledger to see if any funds had been sent to those addresses, and was startled to see the amount.\nHe sorted the transactions, starting with the most valuable ones and sweeping the funds from the broken addresses into one he controlled.\nThe scripts prepared and signed the transactions, double-checking for correctness and transaction fees, about one every two or three minutes. Some, such as freshly mined bitcoins that can only be spent after 100 confirmations, took longer.\nCollecting insecure balances\nAfter nearly an hour, johoe had accumulated the first 150 BTC. He ran his scripts again on the entire 30GB+ blockchain, which took longer, but eventually netted a further 60 BTC.\nOnce all the transactions had been confirmed, johoe posted on Bitcoin Talk that he had the bitcoins and intended to return them to their rightful owners once the problem was fixed.\nWhy, when he could easily have kept the money all for himself, did he decide to do a good deed?\nRunning the scripts once more on the entire ledge swept a further 38 BTC into johoe's wallet.\nAfter seeing Blockchain's public post announcing the security issue, he connected the dots and realized these accounts must be the source of all the compromised addresses he had found.\nThe company contacted him after he posted his message to Bitcoin Talk. He then provided Blockchain with copies of his scripts so they would be able to notify the affected users.\nBlockchain safe 'in principle'\nJohoe posted again on Bitcoin Talk, saying that the first 'buggy transaction' took place on 7th December at 21:53:26 UTC.\n\"In principle, it should be safe to use Blockchain.info again, but I still see some bad transactions\", he wrote on yesterday. The continuing problems could be due to browser cache issues, he added, advising any users to clear their cache and visit their Blockchain account again.\nAny users who sent money, or created a new wallet address on 7th-8th December should consider their addresses broken, he said. Even if it was not published on his list of 1,019 known addresses, he could not pinpoint exactly at what time the problem ended.\nAs an added caution, johoe said that anyone who visited their online Blockchain wallet during that period may have picked up the buggy script in their browser cache, which could potentially affect future address creation or transactions.\nUsers of Blockchain's mobile apps on iOS and Android, and the Chrome browser extension, were not affected.\nFor the past few days, Blockchain's team has been working hard to process claims and return funds – once the claims have been verified as being genuine.\nJohoe said Blockchain had presented him with a \"reasonable reward\" for his efforts.\nHardware wallet security\nJohoe's own wallet solution, as (now famously) evidenced by his Bitcoin Talk post, is a Trezor 'Vault' hardware wallet produced by SatoshiLabs.\n\"It made me feel a lot safer than having the private key for 267 BTC on my computer,\" he said.\nA hardware solution like the Trezor's isolates the private key from the Internet, meaning in principle it is impossible for a remote party to steal it. His only worry was that the device might somehow malfunction, but in the end it \"managed everything gracefully\", despite taking around one and a half minutes to sign the transaction returning the bitcoins.\nThe only disadvantage with the Trezor device, johoe said, is the only current end-user backup support is the myTrezor Web Wallet, which does not work on mobile devices.\nMobile and spending solutions\nOtherwise, johoe recommends a client that employs HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets, such as Bread Wallet on iOS and Armory, Electrum or Wallet32 on Android.\nThese wallets generate key pairs (private and public) from an original seed phrase that needs only be saved somewhere safe once, and can recover balances from that seed even if a physical device is lost, stolen, or damaged.\nEven so, portable solutions are best for spending money only, with larger amounts kept 'cold' or completely offline.\nEven protecting keys with a strong password might not be enough, johoe concluded, if malware has installed a key logger on a user's computer that could grab the password and transmit it to a bad actor.\nCryptography image via Shutterstock\nUPDATE: A previous version of this article stated that johoe had returned 255 BTC. He has since confirmed that this figure has risen to 267 BTC, attributing the additional 12 BTC to addresses that were only compromised later, due to a browser cache issue.",

They are then asked to \"login with Blockchain\".\nThe site then forwards visitors to a site (blockchcain.com) that mimics that of bitcoin wallet and data provider Blockchain. Users attempting to log in and redeem their 'free' bitcoin will actually be giving their password to the scammers.\nIt is worth noting, however, that the text on the fake Bitcoin foundation site is poorly written and likely not the work of a native English speaker. This makes it simpler for visitors to identify the site as a scam.\nAppeal for vigilance\nThe Bitcoin Foundation urges users to report other similar sites they may come across to webmaster@bitcoinfoundation.org, with the subject line \"SCAM SITE\" and also suggests there may be fake sites in languages other than English.\nThe foundation said:\nThis is merely one in a long list of bitcoin scams, but what makes these sites notable is the sheer audacity of the perpetrators, who are trying to pass themselves off as some of the biggest names in bitcoin.\nSee CoinDesk's guide on how to avoid phishing scams here.\nScam alert image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Mauritius: The Tropical Paradise Looking to Become a Blockchain Hub",
    "summary": "Mauritius is luring blockchain innovators with its friendly regulatory environment and connections to countries with large unbanked populations.",
    "content": "Known as the home of lush tropical beaches, the world's second-oldest horse racetrack and the now-extinct Dodo bird, the East African island nation of Mauritius is seeking to brand itself as a regional haven for blockchain innovation.\nSince its independence in 1968, the former Dutch, French and British colony has become one of the most successful economies in the region by building itself up as a technology and financial services hub. Now, Mauritius is looking at blockchain as a catalyst to fortify its competitive advantage and drive continued innovation on the island.\n\"We are working to take our economy to another level, and these kinds of technologies are very important in our strategy,\" said Atma Narasiah, head of technology, innovation and services at the Board of Investment Mauritius, the national investment promotion agency of the island.\nHe told CoinDesk:\nThe island nation has well-established financial services, information and communications technology industries, so attracting investors and entrepreneurs in blockchain and financial technology could be seen as a logical next step.\n\"Blockchain is one of these technologies we want to drive. We see a window of opportunity here to be able to leapfrog others,\" Narasiah said.\nOpen invitation\nIn its quest to become the blockchain hub of the Indian Ocean, Mauritius has issued an open call for innovators to take advantage of the country's new Regulatory Sandbox License (RSL).\nThe sandbox allows companies operating in areas such as financial, medical and communications technology to start operating despite the absence of a formal legislative or licensing framework.\n\"We've been receiving innovative project [proposals] over the years but couldn't execute them because of the gap in the regulatory framework. We've got a very good legal system, but at the pace at which technology is changing, we haven’t been able to keep pace on the regulatory front,\" said Narasiah, adding:\nModeled after similar approaches employed in Australia, Singapore and the UK, the RSL is open to all innovators, but there's an emphasis on attracting blockchain innovators across all verticals.\nThe expectation is that completed projects will help drive domestic and cross-border commerce and eventually expand into a smart city concept that links to other hub cities.\nSince launching in November 2016, the RSL has fielded 11 project proposals, with most under the fintech umbrella.\nTo be considered for approval, applicants must demonstrate their project is innovative, beneficial to the Mauritian economy and it cannot be accommodated in the investor’s home jurisdiction because of legal or regulatory gaps. Qualified applicants can obtain licensure in as little as 30 days, provided that all relevant information is received and risks are properly addressed.\nRegional force\nSo, why should blockchain investors consider setting up in Mauritius?\nNarasiah points to the nation's strong business and governance environment, which has been internationally recognized as the strongest in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAccording to the World Bank's annual \"Doing Business\" survey, Mauritius has the best business climate of any country in the region and ranks 49th out of 190 countries worldwide. The World Bank's rankings weigh factors such as ease of starting a business, enforcing contracts, obtaining credit, protecting investors and paying taxes.\nIn its annual competitiveness rankings, the World Economic Forum said Mauritius possesses Africa’s most competitive economy, best infrastructure and highest-educated workforce.\nNarasiah also highlighted an ongoing build-up of the country’s communications infrastructure – including projects to roll out free Wi-Fi across the island and install fiber optic connections in every residence – as a key attraction for technology investors.\nBridge to big markets\nSuch stability and its geographic location has made Mauritius a popular venue for financial services companies looking to make the jump into new markets on the African continent – where many of the world’s largest unbanked populations exist.\n\"Mauritius is a country that many of the governments of African states would like to emulate. So if you have systems that have been tested properly in Mauritius – it gives a kind of assurance and credibility to that solution when you market it in Africa,\" said Narasiah.\nHe added:\nMauritius also possesses a bilingual workforce speaking both English and French – two of the African continent’s lingua francas – and tax treaties with more than 20 African nations including South Africa, Zambia, Uganda and Rwanda.\nThe island nation also maintains close cultural and economic ties to India – a $2tn economy projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation in the next decade.\nRoughly two-thirds of Mauritians are of Indian descent, and Mauritius has been the largest single source of foreign direct investment into India in recent years because of a favorable double taxation avoidance treaty between the two nations.\nMauritius image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Blockchain now has over two million bitcoin wallets in the wild, having added roughly one million over the last six months alone.\nThe company tweeted the latest milestone late Sunday night, cementing its position as the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet provider.\n— Blockchain.info (@blockchain) August 10, 2014\nPeter Smith, Blockchain's COO, said:\nSmith added that strong growth coupled with price stability is an indicator that the industry is moving towards a \"transactions paradigm.\"\nIndeed, the company has witnessed rapid expansion in recent months.\nBack in January 2013, Blockchain boasted more than 100,000 wallet users. The 500,000th wallet was created in late October and the company rewarded the lucky user of its 500,000th wallet with 10 BTC.\nBlockchain passed the one million mark in January 2014 and by April it had about 1.5 million wallets. In other words, the organisation has doubled its wallet downloads in roughly six months.\nSmith pointed out that downloads \"exploded\" in July, after its iOS wallet was re-launched and made available on the Apple App Store. Earlier this summer, the company also updated its Android wallet with a number of merchant-friendly features.\nThe competition\nBlockchain is not the only bitcoin company to boast such figures. Back in February, San Francisco-based wallet provider and payments processor Coinbase entered six-digit territory and announced that it had more than a million wallets. The company had started with just 13,000 wallets in early 2013.\nBitcoin wallet provider MultiBit also passed the one million mark in March 2014. However, MultiBit cautioned that the statistics were not complete, as data on early adopter downloads dating back to 2011 was lost.\nThere is, however, an important caveat. A significant number of downloaded and installed wallets does not necessarily translate into active bitcoin users.\nWallets are frequently downloaded by people with a casual interest in bitcoin, which means a large number are inactive or abandoned. Blockchain.info charts shed more light on bitcoin user statistics, but it is still difficult to say how many truly active wallets are out there and how many have been abandoned.\nBlockchain told CoinDesk that it is currently handling tens of thousands of transactions every day. An estimated $22bn in bitcoin transactions were made using Blockchain software so far.",

By moving the funds to a shared ledger, the test is seeking to confirm whether that practice can be eliminated, freeing up the capital to be invested in other ventures.\nGoing forward, the founding banks are expected to complete their work next month, at which time the results will be validated by an additional 22 banks, including ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered.\nSkepticism remains\nWhile a small update, news that the test is moving forward nonetheless has notable implications for both Swift and blockchain adoption in banking more broadly.\nFor one, even in spite of multiple blockchain efforts in various stages of development at Swift, the organization remains publicly skeptical of the technology.\nThis has been especially true as it relates to real-time payments, where Swift is expanding its services using traditional payment rails even while startup Ripple takes aim at financial incumbents with its distributed ledger model for instant payments.\nHere, Vanderveken echoed Swift's customarily incredulous tone, concluding that such developments aren't necessarily prompting concern in the organization.\nVanderveken concluded:\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.\nPlanes in formation image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Ether, the native digital currency of ethereum, saw sharp gains this week while bitcoin experienced comparatively mild price fluctuations following last week's halving.\nThe price of ether pushed higher during the seven days through 14th July as the broader ethereum community came closer to implementing a hard fork that would offer a solution to funds compromised during the demise of the distributed autonomous organization, The DAO.\nThe digital currency's price continues to experience volatility \"as the fork debate settles down\", but it seems to be receiving tailwinds stemming from the 14th July commit of the nearly completed hard fork code, algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.\nEliosoff added:\nAt press time, the price of ether was just over $11 on Poloniex. Trading earlier today saw the price rise as high as $12.40, trade data shows.\nApproaching a hard fork\nThe ethereum community has spent several weeks determining how to respond to an incident where 3.6m ETH was moved into a child DAO.\nWhile many have referred to this event as \"The DAO hack\" or theft, the ether was transferred in accordance with the rules of the contract, when someone executed the code of The DAO as written.\nIn the aftermath, developers had attempted to agree upon a viable soft fork, but these attempts have failed. As a result, the ethereum community has been working on a hard fork which, if executed, would move funds from The DAO to a new smart contract that would allow stakeholders to exchange DAO tokens for ethers.\nDuring the last week, ether prices reached as high as $11.71, 15.5% higher than their opening price of $10.14 on 8th July, Poloniex figures reveal.\nThe digital currency retreated slightly before the week was over, closing at $11.50, up 13.4% for the seven-day period.\nStock market image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "The Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) has published a brief article advocating the use of blockchain technology.\nIn the article, the IEET describes the blockchain as next-generation information technology with many potential upsides in a number of fields beyond digital currencies.\nThe IEET made a clear distinction between 'bitcoin 1.0' (currency) and other emerging technologies, classified as 'bitcoin 2.0' (contracts) and 'bitcoin 3.0' (beyond currency and finance) applications of blockchain technology.\nMore than just a currency\nIEET\naffiliate scholar Melanie Swan said the currently developing models of bitcoin and blockchain technology are “not the final paradigm”, as they are plagued by problematic flaws. However, she pointed out that decentralised models in general could have a pronounced impact on technology and society.\nSwan said:\nShe described blockchain technology as one of the first identifiable large implementations of decentralisation models.\nLooking at the bigger picture, Swan argued that decentralised models have the potential to “reorganise all manner of human activity” due to their ability to provide frictionless and trustless interaction between people and technology.\n“The blockchain (decentralised network coordination technology) could emerge as a fundamental infrastructure element in the model to scale humanity to its next levels of orders-of-magnitude-larger progress,” she said.\nConnecting the world\nSwan pointed out that new computing paradigms usually arise once a decade. Mainframes were complemented by PCs in the ’80s, which were revolutionised by the Internet in the ’90s, followed by mobile devices and social networks in the 2000s.\nThe fifth paradigm, according to Swan, could be described as the ‘connected world’ – a future marked by wearables, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and smart homes, cars and cities – all backed by blockchain technology.\nThe IEET is not the first organisation to examine the potential uses of blockchain technology in the emerging field of IoT. Tech heavyweight IBM is also looking similar possibilities, along with German conglomerate Bosch, which is examining ways of monetising IoT with blockchain-derived technologies.\nThis is how the IEET described its vision of the 'connected world' paradigm:\nApple Pay\nwas described as a “critical intermediary step” in moving to a full-fledged cryptocurrency world, in which the blockchain will serve as the seamless economic layer for the web.\nPromoting new technologies\nThe IEET has been promoting new technologies and looking at their social implications for more than a decade.\nThe institute is a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation based in the US and was formed as an offshoot of Humanity+ – an international organisation that advocates the ethical use of emerging technologies to enhance human capacities.\nOver the years, the IEET has had the occasional controversy, with some observers and authors criticising some its views as being transhumanist, a movement that is advocated by Humanity+. The IEET maintains that while some of its fellows have transhumanist views, others do not.\nAs for Swan, she is a principal of the MS Futures Group, a futurist, philosopher and options trader. She was director of research at telco consultancy RHK/Ovum and she previously held management and finance positions at JP Morgan, Fidelity, iPass and Arthur Andersen.\nConnected world image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Mt. Gox\nhas issued an official statement saying it has found a workaround for its bitcoin transaction malleability problems, which will see bitcoin withdrawals resume \"soon\". This comes after the team worked over the weekend to begin implementation of a new transaction system.\nIt said the workaround was \"thanks to our friends at Blockchain.info\", with Blockchain's Andreas Antonopoulos and Ben Reeves \"working like crazy\" over the past week to help the company get things stabilized again. While some might regard the two as Mt. Gox's rivals, it is another example of different interests within the bitcoin economy teaming up for the good of the cause.\nAs expected, when withdrawals recommence they will do so \"at a moderated pace and with new daily/monthly limits in place\" to prevent a run that could put too much strain on the company's resources.\nThe statement said:\nThanks to our friends at Blockchain.info, MtGox now has a workaround that will use a unique identiﬁer created by Blockchain to show whether transactions have been modiﬁed or not. This will prevent any fraudulent use of the malleability issue and protect the assets of our customers.\"\nImplementing the workaround involved re-indexing the entire bitcoin block chain with its 32 million entries, fully deploying the new NTX ID, and implementing a new bitcoin withdrawal queue that would need to be tested before withdrawals could begin. Mt. Gox also implemented new security measures, including email notification for users after logging in.\nThe latest statement is a little different in tone to previous Mt. Gox statements, apologizing for delays and promising a new update \"by Thursday at the latest\", suggesting the company has realized the importance of clear communication with its users.\nBitstamp, another of the 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges, has already allowed withdrawals to begin again after experiencing problems due to the transaction malleability issue.\nProtests continue\nThe small but determined protest outside Mt. Gox's Tokyo office continued over the weekend and into Monday, with visitors reportedly dropping by from different parts of the world to join in.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUBB6jHzmk\nOriginal protestor Kolin Burges claimed he had spoken to a Mt. Gox representative but was still not 100% satisfied the dispute could be resolved to his satisfaction, unless all withdrawals could begin again without holdup. Local trader and bitcoin entrepreneur 'Aaron' said he hoped for a meaningful solution, but had personal doubts Mt. Gox could actually deliver all the bitcoins its users supposedly held in their wallets.\nSo far, there has been no proof or official indication that Mt. Gox does not control all the bitcoins it claims to, and the company maintains its withdrawal suspension is due to technical problems caused by the bitcoin protocol's transaction malleability bug, an issue that was first documented in 2011.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin shopping startup Purse.io is to offer users a $10,000 protection plan to cover any purchases made using its service.",
    "content": "Peer-to-peer bitcoin shopping service Purse.io is now offering a $10,000 customer protection guarantee to cover users against any costs related to purchasing items through its website.\nNotably, the scheme, which was launched on 7th January, will also be available retrospectively to users who report incidents on any past transactions.\nAndrew Lee, CEO of the startup said:\n\"Our payment flow relies on two irreversible transactions: bitcoin transfer through escrow and delivery of a physical good. This is one of the reasons why we are able to deliver drastically lower fraud rates than PayPal, Visa, or any other traditional payments system.\"\n\"The $10,000 guarantee is broad in scope to cover any unexpected costs that may arise from using our services,\" he added.\nThe decision to roll-out the protection plan was taken after a user's home was searched as a result of a purchase he made using the marketplace six months ago.\nPurse.io apologised following an internal investigation, confirming they were \"truly apologetic\" and \"offered to compensate lawyer fees and any other expenses related to the incident\".\nLee said:\n\"When Chesky and company were building Airbnb they did not expect meth heads to destroy a host's home. But when it happened, they dealt with it professionally and restored user confidence. At Purse we are driving mainstream adoption, and we need to meet the standards set by Airbnb, Uber and the like. We hope other companies including Coinbase and Circle follow our lead.\"\nIncreased security\nDespite boasting a relatively impressive safety record, claiming over 10,000 completed transactions and only four reported incidents in the last year, Purse.io will implement additional measures to protect its users further.\nThe company says that, following a doubling of the customer support team in December, numbers will again double in March.\nA 'gamification engine' that puts spending limits on new and unverified buyers has also been introduced in an attempt to minimise fraud. Users can improve their limits by completing successful transactions and via social and phone verification.\nAdditionally, Purse.io has incorporated an algorithm that detects suspicious buyer behaviour by requiring verification before a purchase is made.\n\"As our services scale, we fully expect other edge cases that we can't imagine today. Our job is to quickly learn from them and take measures to prevent, detect and react,\" Lee said.\nHow it works\nPurse.io, which connects users worldwide through a decentralized commerce system, markets its service at people who would like to purchase items on Amazon using bitcoin, which currently is not accepted by the online retailer.\nBy matching these two markets, Purse.io is able to offer bitcoin purchases on Amazon, powered by a kind of bitcoin exchange that uses a buyer discount to incentivise digital currency owners to sell their bitcoin.\nThe process is similar to other peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Brawker, a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate retailers. Purse.io acts as an intermediary by facilitating a user platform, bitcoin wallet and escrow for completing transactions.\nBuyers who want to use bitcoin to purchase discounted Amazon items are required to deposit them in their Purse.io accounts. They are then asked to import their Amazon 'wish list' using a 'share' URL and indicate the level of discount desired. Once this is done, the listing is posted on the Purse.io marketplace.\nThe person willing to buy bitcoin for a similar amount will accept the transaction and purchase the items on the wish list using a credit card so they can be shipped to the Amazon buyer.\nOnce the items have been received, the Amazon buyer is expected to notify Purse.io so the bitcoins can be released from escrow and passed on to the bitcoin buyer.\nIn a previous interview with CoinDesk, Ken Liu, second founder of the company said: \"It's kind of like an exchange, but with an Amazon layer.\"",

    "summary": "The Coinbase iOS app has been removed from the Apple App Store less than a month after its launch.",
    "content": "The Coinbase iOS app, which enabled users to buy, sell and send bitcoin, has been removed from the Apple App Store less than a month after its launch.\nIt appears it was Apple's decision to remove the app, as Coinbase engineer Craig Hammell revealed on Hacker News that his company was not responsible for taking it down.\nAnother forum member suggested the app was removed for \"quality reasons\", but Hammell responded by stating: \"That wasn't the reason that Apple provided us with.\"\nThe iOS app, which was released on 22nd October, enabled users to see how many bitcoins they have in their wallets, plus view any recent transactions.\n\"We’re not sure why it was taken down and we’ve reached out to Apple to request clarification,” Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO and co-founder told TechCrunch.\nAt the time of release, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam said: \"This was one more step in our mission to make bitcoin easier to use. Now that I have the iOS app, I use it to pay back my friends when I’m out and about since it’s so much easier than other ways to do it.\"\nAndroid users can still download the app from the Google Play Store, free of charge.\nOther bitcoin wallet apps have also experienced problems with the App Store in the past, including the BitPak and Blockchain.info applications.\nBitPak\nBack in early May, the app's designer, Rob Sama, received a notification from Apple stating that the application had been deleted. A post by Sama on the BitPak site states: \"I had not been given any reason why, just a simple electronic notification that it had been done.\"\nHe then received a call from Apple around a week later and was told the app had been removed because \"that bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale”.\nSama asked which jurisdictions bitcoin was deemed to be illegal in, and was told: “That is up to you to figure out.\"\nThe developer decided to give up working on BitPak and focus on other projects, although he remains passionate that bitcoin wallet apps should be permitted.\n\"I still believe that the most logical place for a bitcoin wallet to reside is on the mobile phone. It is extremely unfortunate that Apple has chosen to take this stand. I know that there are people working on dedicated dongles to overcome this issue. And maybe that is the way this will play out,\" Sama added.\nBlockchain.info\nRated four out of five stars, the app enables users to send and receive bitcoin payments, view their wallet balances and scan paper wallets.\nThe first version of the app went live in early April 2012, but Apple removed it the following month with no explanation. Blockchain.info enquired why the app had been removed and Apple replied that it violated App Store View Guideline 22.1, which states:\n\"Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws.\"\nA version of the app, which had limited functionality, was then released on 13th April 2012, with full wallet functionality then reinstated three months later on 11th July.\nA representative of Blockchain.info said his company is following the recent development surrounding the Coinbase app \"very carefully\".\n\"We won't speculate as to why Apple has removed the Coinbase app but we're hopeful it has nothing to do with bitcoin and that they come back soon,\" he added.\nThe representative went on to say that, in the meantime, Blockchain.info \"continues to have an iPhone app loved by users and praised by geeks\".\nCoinJar\nAustralia-based company CoinJar created a bitcoin wallet app, which was approved by Apple in October this year.\nIt hails the app as having:\n\"… an easy-to-use interface, a super-responsive QR scanner and all the features you need to send and receive payments.\nYour wallet is in the cloud, wherever you are. There's no blockchain to download and everything just works out of the box.”\nOther bitcoin apps\nThere are a number of other applications on the app store that bitcoiners may find useful, but they don't offer wallet functionality.\nApps such as ZeroBlock and btcReport operate as bitcoin price tickers and other applications such as Bitcoin Monitor offer more in-depth information, such as mining difficulty, total number of bitcoins in circulation and the average time it takes for a new block to be mined.\nCoinDesk is awaiting comment from Coinbase.\nFeatured image: Rob Boudon / Flickr",

    "content": "The emergence of bitcoin is just one more signal that society has fully moved into the digital age.\nTechnology has changed the way that we do just about everything in our lives, including the ways we consume data and information.\nThe days of pencil-pushing to gather and analyse data are numbered, and new tools have made gathering, sorting, analysing and visualising enormous amounts of data easier than ever.\nBitcoin, of course, lends itself perfectly to these quantitatively-focused metric tools.\nFew things about the digital currency are subjective, and even though nobody knows for certain what drives bitcoin’s price changes, plenty of people have tried their hand at using technical analysis to predict price trends.\nLuckily for us, there’s no shortage of companies working with data to paint a picture of the ever-changing bitcoin ecosystem.\nThese websites provide information on pricing, trading, market capitalisations, blockchain statistics and more.\nHere are nine of the most helpful bitcoin data resources:\n1. Coinometrics\nCoinometrics\nprides itself on its “institutional-level bitcoin data and research”, and the company’s analyses of volatility, price dispersion and currency flows have a refreshingly proprietary feel.\n2. Coinmap\nFor bitcoiners eager to spend their BTC at brick-and-mortar businesses, Coinmap is a godsend. The site has a minimalist design, but is well populated with information on hundreds of retailers that accept bitcoin at their physical store locations.\n3. Blockchain.info\nPerhaps the most well known resource for analysing the block chain, Blockchain.info has basic information on a number of metrics like market capitalisation, transaction volume, hash rate and more.\nIn addition to these stats, users can look up every bitcoin transaction on the block chain by searching a bitcoin address to trace where the coins came from and how much BTC is stored at any particular wallet address.\n4. Bitcoincharts.com\nA user favorite for pricing information, bitcoincharts.com offers a comprehensive look at the digital currency network, with a focus on technical analysis of price trends. The site offers a number of customisations for viewing price charts, and the long term view offers a nice perspective on the currency's price history.\n5. CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin isn’t the only player in the digital currency space. There are a number of altcoins gathering momentum in the industry, and while none rival bitcoin’s $7.7bn market cap, CoinMarketCap keeps an up-to-date record of the market capitalisation of some 462 digital currencies.\n6. Bitnodes\nBitnodes\nis in development for a very specific pupose: to estimate and visualise the size of the bitcoin network. Powered by the Bitcoin Foundation, the site’s tools gather data on all the nodes running the bitcoin protocol version 70001.\n7. Wizbit\nFor those yearning for a more visually focused analysis of bitcoin transactions, Wizbit fits the bill perfectly. The site shows all transactions and newly mined blocks in realtime on an eye-catching spinning globe.\n8. Blockr.io\nBlockr.io\nis another block chain-focused site that offers data on the block chains of currencies like bitcoin, litecoin, peercoin and more. The site’s “block explorer” has plenty of data on recent blocks, block difficulty, and estimates of future block difficulty, among other things.\n9. CoinDesk\nOf course we’re inclined to point out that CoinDesk is not only the world leader in bitcoin news, but also an industry-leading source for data and information on topics like price, venture capital investments and a number of bitcoin network statistics.\nOur bitcoin ATM map recently launched as a tool to visualize the ever-growing number of bitcoin ATMs around the world and to provide information for those looking to find a bitcoin ATM nearby.\nData analysis image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "\"It’s all possible with blockchain…\"\nYou hear this over and over at industry conferences. But this time, at the Distributed: Health conference in Nashville, this pie-in the-sky statement got a bit more pushback than usual.\nAccording to many of the speakers at the on 3rd October show, blockchain tech stands to disrupt the complex and frustrating healthcare system in a positive way, mostly revolving around simplifying the management and transfer of health records and information.\nChris Kay, senior vice president and chief innovation officer at Humana, said during the morning keynote address:\nIn his mind, a blockchain — which provides trust without a central authority, security and data transparency — could marry the disparate processes in healthcare. For example, a blockchain-based health care system might provide insight into the variety of medical issues a person might be suffering from and integrate health care with the social care of family and friends.\nWhile the biggest issues to fix remain outside the scope of blockchain – think the difficulty in choosing fresh, healthy food over McDonald’s – Kay believes busting down the silos in healthcare could be the beginning stages of a healthcare revolution.\nData needs to flow between primary health care providers, specialists and holistic medicine practitioners that a patient is using. In that way, people could get better, more targeted recommendations on what they can do to better their health.\nWhile Kay was optimistic about blockchain’s impact on the healthcare industry, when it came to the breakout sessions, both panelists and the audience seemed more skeptical.\n\"Any IT person from a health organization should come in with a healthy level of skepticism,\" said Andrew Beal, blockchain and distributed infrastructure lead at Ernst & Young (EY), adding:\nWhat the industry really needs\nThe idea that the market is too immature for production-ready services was supported by Wayne Vaughan, founder and CEO of Tierion, a global platform for verifying data, during a panel discussion.\n\"I would caution that nothing is production-ready right now,\" he said.\nThat position was contested by Ted Tanner, co-founder and chief technology officer at PokitDok, a blockchain-based company focused on the healthcare industry. Tanner suggested that PokitDok’s proof-of-stake private blockchain is ready for production today.\n\"We have very large companies using our APIs. It’s just a matter of switching out the underlying infrastructure,\" Tanner said.\nBut the goal, according to Jeff Cunningham, another panelist and chief technology officer of health IT company Informatics Corporation of America (ICA), is more about updating existing infrastructure than ripping it up and replacing it.\nEven for an industry where settling times for claims can extend more than 180 days and health payers spent $375b sending out paper claims, \"if there’s a better way, the costs of re-architecting are so high it doesn’t happen\", he said.\nHealthcare today is largely a system of barriers. The industry itself is highly regulated, much like financial services. And this adds significant hurdles for any startup trying to enter the space.\nPlus the federal government, through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) is the single largest payer of healthcare in America, so public/private entity partnerships are going to be a must.\n\"From a positive aspect, many of the challenges that exist in healthcare today are around complex distributed processes; it’s how the industry has grown up, all siloed,\" said Cunningham. \"But if you start to rethink how healthcare should look as a more complex, team-based healthcare plus finance and payment with the care, the blockchain could be the fabric to ties that together.\"\nThe focus should be on how physicians, not patients, interact with the system, he said.\n\"For the most part to make progress in healthcare today … at least on the care side, it’s [about] how you interact with the provider,\" Cunningham said. \"Provider interaction will be about interacting with those physicians and how they are interacting with the technology.\"\nSecurity as a innovation motivator\nData security, from what event attendees and panelists had to say, seems to be the big driver in the push for the healthcare industry to adopt blockchain technology.\n\"Ninety percent of companies in this space have been affected by a data breach,\" said Micah Winkelspecht, founder and CEO of Gem during an afternoon keynote. With a distributed network, there will not be a single point of failure for fraudsters to try and hack into anymore, he contended.\nOthers are skeptical as to whether blockchain would actually solve that problem.\nSeveral people voiced concern that blockchain merely shifts the security problem. Because blockchains are not good data stores, not all health information could be stored on it. Instead most startups think a digital identity that points to health records somewhere else is what will be housed on a blockchain.\nYet that brings in the existing issue with third party providers housing large data sets on centralized servers.\nAccording to Andrew Keys, head of global business development at ConsenSys, the industry will fall back on traditional security mechanisms, like two-factor authentication and multi-signature transactions to shore up these gaps.\n\"You could have a perfect blockchain identity system but it depends how people on the outside decide to store and use the information,\" said Tierion’s Vaughan. \"The network is a source of information but it doesn’t mean others won’t save it. Blockchain doesn’t mean the end of data silos.\"\nPlus, large health IT providers aren’t going to want a shared infrastructure for archiving because it’ll be costly to maintain, Vaughan added.\nControlling medical spend\nAnd according to nearly everyone at the conference, including Winkelspecht, healthcare spending is already out of control.\nHealthcare spending in the US totals more than $2tn annually, representing one-seventh of the economy. By 2017, as reported by CMS, healthcare spending will grow to $4tn annually.\nMany times, more than 300 people touch a single medical claim, he said, which only decreases security and costs stakeholders significant amounts of money. The healthcare industry spends about $10,000 per citizen every year, and spending is predicted to increase by 5.8% next year, he continued.\n\"Yet we still haven’t fixed the problem. You have a one in five chance of re-entering a hospital within 30 days,\" Winkelspecht said. \"So the industry is spending on new technology but not making the care any better.\"\nThese all add up to a frustrating system that is in dire need of reworking. And while questions arose about how the industry might use blockchain to get there, many people remained optimistic.\nBeal, who’s bullish on blockchain technology, said that within finance, blockchain started a conversation that led banks and payment providers to work on upgrading their systems. It’ll at least be the same in healthcare, he argued.\n\"If the only benefit … is that it forces IT professionals at hospitals and payers to look at their tech stack and areas they could update it, that’ll be enough,\" Beal said.\nImage via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Major Security Flaw 'Heartbleed' Puts Critical Services at Risk",
    "summary": "A major security flaw affecting over half the internet could have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable bitcoin services.",
    "content": "Over half the internet could have been compromised by a two-year-old security flaw that also could affect a number of online bitcoin services, it was revealed today.\nThe vulnerability, named 'Heartbleed’, affects versions of OpenSSL, an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS internet security protocols that encrypt and secure internet traffic, including: passwords, messages, e-commerce and banking, and other sensitive data including Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). OpenSSL is the most popular software library used for this purpose.\nTwo years old\nThe Heartbleed flaw has reportedly been known to researchers since 2011, and even 'black hat' hackers since 2012, meaning critical data on a large portion of the internet has been openly available for years. There have been no confirmed reports of exploits, though attacks leave no trace.\nSecurity admins around the world are now hurriedly applying a fix, and changing certificates and secret keys on the off-chance they could have been compromised.\nSince it weakens any site using the 'secure' https protocol, the threat isn't specifically to bitcoin services like wallets and exchanges. But given authorities' tendency to ignore bitcoin thefts or inability to investigate them effectively, it could leave bitcoin services more vulnerable than 'traditional' online financial or other critical ones.\nTest your services' sites\nItalian security expert Filippo Valsorda built a web-based test that allows anyone to enter a server's hostname to see if it is affected or not. He also posted open-source code for the test on GitHub.\nAt the time of writing, entering major bitcoin services addresses on Valsorda's site showed that Blockchain, Coinbase and BitPay were safe, but that the world's most popular exchange, Bitstamp, remained vulnerable.\nValsorda too was more concerned about online bitcoin services than anything inherent in other implementations, saying it was \"simple to exploit and not that quick to patch\".\n\"However almost everything public facing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is (rightly) secured with TLS (think all web wallets, exchanges but also APIs and Mail servers) and potentially (probably) affected.\"\nRushing to patch software, rotate certs\nIt's estimated over 50% of internet servers use some form of OpenSSL (and probably a lot more). The thought that over half the internet's sensitive data could have been exposed for two years has left security departments sweating.\nExploiting Heartbleed, an attacker could access the RAM of affected systems, allowing them to see up to 64 kilobytes of data at a time – enough to build up enough knowledge to access a system's secret keys. Those keys are used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive traffic and identify service providers.\nOnce secret keys are gained, attackers could read any traffic to and from a server openly or impersonate services and users.\nAttacks on a vulnerable system do not require man-in-the-middle techniques and leave no trace, leaving sysadmins with no sure way to know if their systems have been compromised.\nThe extent of the potential damage left some reeling:\n– matt blaze (@mattblaze) 8th April 2014\nMike Hearn\n, developer and chair of the Bitcoin Foundation's Law and Policy Committee, said he hoped the impact on bitcoin services would be limited, but noted that bitcoin services didn't always employ best practices for security:\nCompanies react\nFollowing the news, many bitcoin and altcoin exchanges took to twitter to issue official responses and update users on their progress tackling the flaw.\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) April 8, 2014\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič revealed that although the company had patched its servers successfully, its DDoS mitigation provider, Incapsula, must do the same to ensure full security.\nHence, the exchange has chosen to remain \"on the safe side\" and temporarily deactivate account registrations, account logins and all virtual currency withdrawal functions.\nOther exchanges have since issued similar statements via the platform, including Bitfinex – a recent addition to CoinDesk's BPI.\n— Bitfinex.com (@bitfinex) April 8, 2014\nMeanwhile, platforms like localbitcoins.com and Bitcurex have reported greater success:\n— LocalBitcoins.com (@LocalBitcoins) April 8, 2014\nBlockchain.info also released a statement via its website stating that it upgraded services a week ago. The company also emphasised that wallet passwords are never sent to its server.\nIt added: “We’ll be continuing to investigate as needed and provide you with any necessary updates.\"\nPublic information release\nNews of Heartbleed's existence was released by Finnish IT security consultancy Codenomicon, who published the description after trying the exploit for itself. A Google Security engineer, Neel Mehta, reported it to the OpenSSL team while Adam Langley and Bodo Moeller prepared a fix.\nThe name comes from the bug's existence in OpenSSL's 'heartbeat' extension, and does not represent any flaw in the SSL/TLS protocol itself.\nCodenomicon said exploitation was 'easy' and that it had successfully attacked its own services, gaining access to secret keys for X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, and other 'business critical' communications.\nOpenSSL's security advisory said Heartbleed affected 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases of the software library, including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1.\n\"A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or server,\" it read, advising users to either upgrade immediately or remove heartbeats from their version of OpenSSL by recompiling it with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS.\"\nThis story was co-authored by Grace Caffyn.\nHeart image via Shutterstock",

Rival Coinbase currently lists 2.5 million wallets in the wild.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, CEO Peter Smith could not confirm how many of Blockchain's wallet accounts are active (ie contain funds) for privacy reasons. However, he pointed to record-breaking transaction volume as a sign of bitcoin's user growth.\n\"You can look to the 140% (approx.) year-over-year growth in the number of transactions powered by our software daily to get a sense for activity, which, as a company focused on making it easy to transact, is really encouraging,\" he said.",

Announced earlier this year, that initiative with the FDA is aimed at testing a blockchain-based platform through which electronic medical records, clinical trials, and health data gathered from wearable devices could be better shared.\n“This is, in essence, an extension of the work we’ve been doing this year with the FDA...exploring owner-mediated data exchange using blockchain,\" Ebadollahi remarked at the event.\nIndeed, the CDC is no stranger to the technology. Last month, as reported by CoinDesk, the CDC – which operates within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is chiefly responsible for preventing and responding to disease outbreaks – is looking at the tech as a way to capture critical information during crisis situations more effectively.\nHHS, too, is one of several U.S. government departments that is exploring the use of blockchain, particularly in the area of medical administration.\nImage via Wikimedia",

    "content": "UPDATE (25th February, 17:30 GMT): Mt. Gox has released a statement on its website concerning its decision to halt trading.\nUPDATE (25th February, 13:47 GMT): Domain investor Andy Booth has confirmed the sale of www.gox.com to Mark Karpeles.\nUPDATE (25th February, 09:28 GMT): The source code on Mt. Gox's website now reads \"put announce for mtgox acq here\" leading some to speculate on the motives behind the document leak:\n— Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) February 25, 2014\n___________________________________________________________\nA document has surfaced suggesting that troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will close for one month as part of a four-step rebranding plan, and that CEO and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Mark Karpeles will step down from his executive position as part of the process.\nThe bitcoin price has been tumbling all morning amid the news, hitting a low of $419 so far.\nEntitled “Crisis Strategy Draft,” the document suggests the company’s increasingly dire financials are greatly impacting the decision. By Mt. Gox’s own estimates, it has only 2,000 BTC and approximately $22.4m in fiat currencies in its possession.\nThe document was first reported by Ryan Galt, aka the Two-Bit Idiot, who later confirmed to CoinDesk:\nThe document is branded with the current Mt. Gox logo and a redesigned version, and claims to have detailed inside knowledge of Mt. Gox and its financial affairs, but appears to be written by a team external to Mt. Gox’s current management.\nThe document is publicly available for viewing here and embedded below this article.\nAccording to the leak, Mt. Gox has lost close to 744,408 BTC or $350m at current prices, and faces an unconfirmed additional $55m in fiat liabilities. The company suggests that theft related to transaction malleability has been ongoing for several years, but was not reported by the company.\nWe can assume now that withdrawals will not recommence, at least not in the foreseeable future. Customers with Mt. Gox accounts will not be receiving their bitcoins or possibly even other currencies in what is effectively an insolvency, though no-one in an official position is using that word.\nAt Japan time on the eve of the statements, Japan’s finance and banking regulator the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it would not be intervening in the issue as it did not view supervision of digital currency exchanges as part of its obligations.\nSeeking capital injection\nRumors of the proposal first began circulating on 24th February, when the document was posted on the popular digital currency blog The Two-Bit Idiot. Sources close to the company suggest the document is real, and that it is part of a plan by Mt. Gox to raise investor capital.\nThe document paints a vivid picture of potential investors who are seeking to raise the necessary capital to continue operations, or at least use whatever remains of Mt. Gox’s brand value to begin a new venture.\nWhile admitting Mt. Gox’s image is “broken”, it notes that throughout the recent bad press customers have continued to deposit funds and trade on the exchange.\nThe document also evokes sweeping rhetoric aimed to tie Mt. Gox’s fate to that of the broader bitcoin community: “The likely consequences will be larger than this localized financial damage, and we believe that the benefits of keeping MtGox stable and running outweigh the risks. This isn’t about saving MtGox anymore.”\nIt suggested the demise of its brand could set bitcoin back “five to 10 years”, and that governments should and would react “swiftly and harshly”. “At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public,” the document reads.\nMt. Gox, through intermediary sources, declined to comment on the validity of the reports at press time.\nHigh-profile responses\nCoinapult founder and bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees posted a lengthy and emotional commiseration on Reddit, claiming he had 550 BTC stored with Mt. Gox himself and “will never get any of that back”. He wrote:\nWhile laying the blame firmly at the feet of Mt. Gox, he affirmed that bitcoin itself was not at fault and security was not impossible, and implored others to continue “building a new financial order.”\n“It won’t be the last calamity endured before the win,” he continued.\nSeveral high-profile bitcoin companies, including Coinbase and Blockchain.info, moved swiftly to distance themselves from Mt. Gox and launch into a strident defense of bitcoin itself in a joint statement:\n— Blockchain.info (@blockchain) February 25, 2014\nRebranding process\nThe leaked proposal recommends a full rebranding of the company and even a possible relocation to another jurisdiction, like Singapore.\nFirstly, it calls for the immediate reduction of liabilities through the injection of new bitcoins and the purchase of coins at depressed prices on its own exchange, in what sources told CoinDesk amounted to a bailout of the embattled exchange.\nIt paints a wishful picture of brand continuity without promising much to customers, maybe to neutralize any anger bound to arise from a hard shutdown and keep stakeholders’ hopes somewhat alive.\n“Customer support will stay operational to deal with people who want to have access to their account/history”, it says, while maintaining that few, if any, staff employed at the current company would remain, particularly CEO Karpeles.\nIt continues: “The MtGox price is low, making it possible to erase a significant portion of the debt, but it needs to be done quickly.”\nReducing liabilities\nThe document notes that protecting the image of bitcoin itself is a primary concern, since a failure on Mt. Gox’s scale will be a disaster for digital currency in mainstream eyes.\nTo reduce this damage, it appears to put out a plea to high profile members of the bitcoin community to inject funds in the order of 200,000 BTC into the exchange, saying “the costs of not doing so are incalculable at this stage.”\n“Support from Bitcoin big players and core community - long term, high leverage: Coins for equity, coin donations, and cash injections to buy coins at the cheap MtGox price are some options among many.”\n“Bet on future profit to refill the lost coins - Long term, low leverage: Regardless of malleability and regulatory issues, MtGox's main problems are massive robbery and poor bitcoin accounting. However, the business as an exchange is highly profitable and healthy when run properly.”\nMt. Gox becomes Gox\nThe document suggests stakeholders would eventually see some kind of return, without saying when or indeed what the return might be. Should the company re-open with a new image, the strategy would be to limit withdrawals both in bitcoin and cash to prevent a bank run.\nNote the timeframe (italics are for emphasis):\nManagement reshuffle\nRemoving Mt. Gox’s management team seems to be a priority and, ironically, this is an area the Japanese authorities seem willing to regulate: “In Japan, a CEO cannot resign until a new CEO is nominated. In that case customers knows that MtGox is still around and working, but under new management.”\nIt continues: “Try to reduce the impact and raise stakeholder confidence, and eventually get Mark out.”\nOne strategy the document puts forward is a “Letter from the CEO”, essentially a mea culpa from Mark Karpeles that admits Mt. Gox’s technology was inadequate to deal with the task of maintaining a bitcoin exchange, both in transaction volumes and response to the the malleability issue.\nMounting evidence\nThough doubts remain among certain high-profile sources, at least two of the company’s four listed strategy points seem to have already been confirmed.\nFor example, Part Three of the four-part plan called for the company to rebrand as Gox.com, a process that it said would require it to “reset all SNS channels for communication”, which is consistent with Mt. Gox deleting its entire history of Twitter posts just yesterday.\nJoe Politzer, the broker in question, added:\nA search of the Internet domain registration database WHOIS seems to confirm Mt. Gox’s intention to rebrand as Gox.com. The resource shows that the domain Gox.com has been purchased by Mt. Gox parent company Tibanne Co Ltd, and is currently owned by Karpeles.\nMtGox Situation: Crisis Strategy Draft by twobitidiot\nThis story was co-authored by Pete Rizzo and Jon Southurst. Hat tip to Ryan Galt (aka Two-Bit Idiot) for breaking the news.\nCoinDesk is monitoring this developing story, and will post updates as they become known.",

    "content": "Bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain is today launching an option for users to create ethereum software wallets, a move that marks the first time the startup has integrated a new cryptocurrency since it launched in 2011.\nAnnounced today, the launch also coincides with a new partnership with cryptocurrency exchange service ShapeShift that will enable users to transition funds between their bitcoin and ethereum wallets, without first needing to send funds to a centralized service.\nBut while Blockchain executives largely kept the focus on how this would enable retail users to continue to experiment with cryptocurrencies, in comments, they also hinted at the possible business applications that could be available should the service.\nCEO Peter Smith said in a statement:\nElsewhere, the company said it is open to offering other services to ethereum users, hinting its data tools could soon see an overhaul. Also mentioned was the possibility that a software wallet could be available to business users.\nThe company said its release today is not designed for developers or companies.\nNonetheless, such advancements could be propelled forward by new funding. Blockchain recently raised $40 million in a Series B funding round, drawing from a group of investors that included billionaire Richard Branson. The startup has raised more than $70 million to date in venture funding, according to CoinDesk data.\nMore broadly, it's also the latest sign bitcoin businesses are now adapting their business models to support multiple blockchains.\nOther services have moved to integrate ether in recent days, including cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp and Falcon Private Bank, a Swiss-based private bank that added support for ether just over a month after it first began offering bitcoin services.\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockchain and ShapeShift.\nPeter Smith image via CoinDesk",

    "content": "The UK government is exploring the use of blockchain technology in a bid to improve the transparency and accuracy of its record keeping.\nIn a post on the blog of the Government Digital Service, a unit of the UK Cabinet Office, technical architect Paul Downey explains that his team has been examining registers – how they are currently formatted and managed, and how they could potentially be improved through the use of a blockchain.\nThe post details the different types of register that are currently maintained by the government, including open, closed and private registers. It continues:\nOne such problem is the delay that exists between a change being made to data on a register and that change being made available to users of the service. This exists with registers that cannot be accessed directly through an API.\nData integrity\nDowney goes on to say that a more important issue is that of data integrity, which relies upon each register having a reliable registrar and method of recording and updating the data in question.\nThe perfect register “should be able to prove the data hasn’t been tampered with” and should store a history of the changes that have been made, plus “be open to independent scrutiny”, he argues.\nIn response to a comment on the post questioning how government-issued licences, certificates and other documents could be stored to assist should there be discrepancies over the data in the record, Downey suggests that blockchain technology could, potentially, provide a solution.\n“We are aware of how protocols such as the blockchain demonstrate how proofs could be distributed,\" he writes.\nHowever, Downey concedes this is just one of a number of different models his team has started to explore with the aim of increasing “the trust in integrity of record”.\nThought leading\nThe proposal has drawn initial support from some corners of the digital currency community in the UK.\nA spokesperson for the UK Digital Currency Association lauded the government's initiative in exploring such concepts. They went on to say there is “no better way” to deliver a public register than through a blockchain. These can be used to transparently record public lists of data, “from land registries to licensed pub landlords”.\nThe spokesperson concluded:\nArchives image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "IBM has struck yet another notable deal in Latin America.\nAnnounced today, a partnership between IBM and AOS, a Colombian provider of logistics solutions, finds the two firms developing a new blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) solution for the logistics business.\nBeing built with IBM Blockchain and IBM Watson to track the provenance and status of trucks and their goods, the solution records the handling of transactions and information on cargoes to create greater transparency in the delivery process, according to AOS's director of innovation, Ricardo Buitrago.\n\"Having the right hardware, software and cloud environment is what gives our clients the protection to ensure blockchain is secure. We’re thinking about the whole spectrum, how we can secure as much as possible and how we can do it with the most integrity,\" explained Jorge Vergara, CTO of IBM Colombia.\nSo how does it work?\nTrucks are equipped with RFID tags that contain data on the vehicle, the name of the driver and details of its load, according to Buitrago.\nIoT sensors would track the journey of the shipment, as well as the availability of free space on a truck, and record this data on the blockchain for all relevant parties to access. According to IBM and AOS, this process is usually done manually, and is slower and prone to error.\nBuitrago told CoinDesk:\nThe solution integrates with IBM’s Watson IoT system to check in on factors like weather and temperature, which can impact the journey and the estimated delivery time.\nHard data\nIoT in logistics is expected to be worth more than $10bn by 2020, per market research. A report from Cisco and DHL estimated that IoT in logistics and supply chain will generate $1.9tn in value.\nCompanies often lack hard figures or data on where exactly their shortcomings and losses are in the transport cycle, said Buitrago, adding:\nBut as blockchains become more efficient and produce greater network effects, the next challenge will be growing that network.\nOne company has signed up to use the new solution so far. AOS declined to name the firm, but Buitrago said deployment is planned for July. For now, the solution will only be available in the Colombian market.\nLorries image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "We review the Blockchain wallet for Android, which lets you transfer bitcoins directly from your mobile.",
    "content": "The Blockchain.info website can be used as a mobile wallet thanks to its Android app. Blockchain.info is best known as Bitcoin's block chain explorer, but it also has a wallet feature where you can send and receive bitcoins. With the Android app, you can access all this while you're on the move.\nThe app opens up asking you either to create a new account or to pair with your existing wallet. Registering on the website is better as there are a few pieces of data to keep a record of. Pairing with the website involves opening your account details on the blockchain.info website, and clicking on the devices section, and there you'll find an option to display a QR code. This can then be scanned by the app on your phone, then the pairing is complete. As far as the app design goes, it is easy to pair, it just takes a little digging to find the QR code on the website.\nOnce paired, you are shown a summary of your wallet, including balance and a list of transactions. Besides the balance is a small icon of a QR code. Tapping this reveals a larger QR and your wallet address. Other bitcoin users can scan this to send you money.\nAdditionally, tapping the leftward arrow on the app's toolbar lets you generate a QR code request. Here, you need to configure the QR code with the amount of BTC you wish to receive.\nTapping on each transaction lets you see extended information, such as the amount, value, and how many confirmations it has received from bitcoin nodes.\nYou can send money too by tapping the rightwards arrow on the toolbar. The app supports Quick Send, Custom Send, and Shared Send. It's all straight forward.\nThe app also lets you view exchange rates, via the main menu, which also gives access to the app settings. The settings pages actually redirects you to a web page, where you can establish how to receive notifications of new transactions. By default, notifications will appear in your Android status bar. Strangely, there is also an option to buy bitcoins on the main menu, but the web page that it directs you to is just blank.\nWe'd recommend this app as a decent starting point for handling your bitcoin wallet on a mobile device. If you were expecting, from its name that you'd be able to use the app to explore the blockchain then you'd only be half right. The app only shows your transactions and contains hyperlinks that break you out into your phone's browser to show the corresponding page on the blockchain.info website.\nAs a mobile bitcoin wallet, this app works as seen by our story about buying beer for bitcoins!\nYou can find the Blockchain.info app on the Google Play Store.",

    "summary": "Malware hidden in a private wallet app is reportedly stealing large amounts of bitcoin from Mac OS X users.",
    "content": "UPDATE (12th February, 11:35 GMT): SecureMac reports the bitcoin-stealing malware has spread to popular download sites like Download.com and MacUpdate, under several different names. If you think your machine could be infected, take a screenshot of the instructions here and disconnect from the internet immediately.\nA Mac OS X trojan horse masquerading as a private bitcoin wallet app is responsible for \"multiple\" bitcoin thefts, according to Mac security researchers.\nSecureMac\n, a Mac security consultancy that develops the MacScan anti-malware application and blogs about its research, released a report today warning of 'CoinThief.A'.\nHidden within the open-source OS X bitcoin wallet app StealthBit, CoinThief.A monitors users' web traffic to steal login credentials for software wallets and popular bitcoin sites, including BTC-e, Mt. Gox, and Blockchain.info.\nUpdate: Versions of the malware have been found with numerous different names on other popular software download sites, such as Download.com and MacUpdate.com. BitVanity and StealthBit were distributed on Github, while Bitcoin Ticker TTM and Litecoin Ticker were distributed on Download.com and MacUpdate.com. It seems both app names were copied from legitimate apps in the Mac App Store, but the malicious payload was not found in the official Mac App Store copies of these apps.\nMismatched code\nSuspicion arose when investigators discovered the precompiled version did not match the source (which more knowledgeable users could examine for themselves and needed to compile before using). The precompiled version contained the malware, whereas the open-source code did not.\nThe report said:\nAdditionally, the malware installs a program that continually runs in the background, looking for bitcoin wallet login credentials, which are then sent back to a remote server.\"\nThe browser extensions had innocuous sounding names like 'Pop-up Blocker' to avoid detection. Once installed, the trojan also searches the system for anti-malware software and logs unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each infected machine.\nLarge thefts\nAt least one Bitcoin Talk Forum user reported a whopping 20BTC theft after installing StealthBit, which was also posted on reddit.\nOther investigators noted several similarities between StealthBit and Bitvanity, another piece of notorious Mac malware that stole users' bitcoins last August. Bitvanity posed as a vanity wallet address generator that harvested addresses and private keys from software like the Bitcoin-Qt client.\nStealthBit's GitHub code repository was stored under the username 'thomasrevor' and a reddit user named 'trevorscool' posted an announcement about its development there on 2nd February. Last year, Bitvanity's GitHub code was posted under the name 'trevory'.\nAs reported previously on CoinDesk, there are rich rewards for malware and ransomware developers trading in bitcoin thanks to its mostly unregulated and difficult-to-trace nature. Accomplices can be paid, and ransoms collected from anywhere in the world.\nOpen-source security\nThe discovery has highlighted the benefits (and issues) that surround open-source software. While the malware was not contained in the open-source version of the code, less able or impatient users may still have trusted the precompiled version on GitHub and installed without a second thought.\nThe 'clean' open-source version, however, allowed programmers to find a discrepancy between the two versions within days of its appearance, leading to speedy warnings of the malware and, hopefully, fewer infections.\nHacker Image via Shutterstock",

Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary confirmed to CoinDesk that the funds had been received.\nEven before the funds were returned, Blockchain had admitted it was at fault and promised to reimburse any users who had lost money.\nRandom number flaw\nThe problem that led to the vulnerability was reportedly wallets generated with previously used 'R-values' in formulas that generate random numbers, meaning a hacker could use the public address to calculate its private keys. If R-values are unique, this should be impossible.\nFor the technically-inclined, Blockchain CTO Ben Reeves has pointed out the mistake in code on Blockchain's GitHub page here.\nBlockchain posted in a statement that the issue affected web wallet users who had created a new wallet address or sent funds from an existing address during the period the vulnerability was live.\nAccording to johoe\n, Reeves sent an email asking him to send the funds to this address, which johoe duly did, posting a photo of a Trezor wallet sending the transaction.\nStill solving the problem\nCustomers on Bitcoin Talk and Reddit, while relieved their funds were swept by someone with good intentions, are now contacting Blockchain to prove their losses and have them returned.\nAt this stage, however, it is not 100% confirmed that all funds removed from Blockchain wallets were under johoe's control. At least one user has claimed that nearly 100 BTC missing from his wallet have gone elsewhere.\nBlockchain is in the process of examining \"thousands\" of customer claims and support tickets for authenticity before reimbursing.\nTrezor wallet image via johoe/bitcointalk.org.

He also reassured bitcoiners that he was aware of the situation at hand and did not intend to harm the community.\n— Jeffrey Smith (@jeff_smith01) June 11, 2014\nWhile Smith may understand the repercussions of his pool approaching the 51% mark, the exchange has not released a plan of action to mitigate the threat.\nHowever in correspondence with CoinDesk, Smith said they were still working on a strategy.\n— Jeffrey Smith (@jeff_smith01) June 13, 2014\nIn a similar episode from January 2014 where its total hashing power hit 42%, Ghash.io released an statement outlining its plans to reduce its network share.\nAccording to the press release, the exchange temporarily stopped accepting new independent mining facilities to their pool. They also said they were implementing a feature allowed CEX.IO users to mine bitcoin from other pools.\nMany bitcoin miners around the world also started leaving the Ghash.io bitcoin pool following this news. Within a day Ghash.io’s mining power dropped from 42% to 38%, according to Blockchain.info.\nA numbers game\nTheoretically, a 51% attack would occur if one entity managed to gain control of more than 50% of the network’s computer power. Such an attack could allow the attacker to reverse transactions they have sent, make double-spend transactions, prevent confirmations or even prevent other miners from mining valid blocks. It would corrupt the block chain and render the entire system unsafe.\nHowever, this is speculative and has not been done before.\nIn January, Blockchain’s chief security officer Andreas M. Antonopoulos explained at a bitcoin meetup in Los Angeles why he is not worried about a 51% attack.\nGhash.io's Popularity\nGhash.io\nis owned by CEX.IO, a London-registered bitcoin exchange which was one of the first cloudhashing services to gain popularity.\nGhash.io has been around for over a year and gained popularity among miners for its 0% fee structure. Miners can also buy mining contracts from CEX.IO. These features have made the pool extremely popular, contributing to its potential 51% hashing power.",

    "content": "When ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith took the stage this morning at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, the title of their panel was already out of date.\n\"Bitcoin Beyond $20 Billion: Digital Currency's Future,\" it read – but with bitcoin trading at close to $2300, the market cap of the currency is already $37 billion and climbing, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\nDuring their appearance on the Consensus 2017 main stage today, both Smith and Voorhees shared their thoughts on why bitcoin is performing so well as an asset right now – and what we can expect from the future. The two perhaps have a unique vantage point to view the market: Voorhees runs a digital currency exchange while Smith leads one of the industry's longest-running wallet offerings.\nFor his part, Voorhees made the argument that market participants ought to brace themselves, and grow accustomed to a cycle of highs and lows.\n\"People should expect bubbles with cryptocurrencies. They have been with us since the beginning of time and in crypto they are especially pronounced,\" he said.\nBut how high will it go? According to Smith, bitcoin has only two options: soar to great heights, or crash and burn.\nHe told the audience:\nBut why?\nAs might be expected, the topic of why the market is behaving the way it is emerged as a central conversation point.\nSmith threw out a couple optimistic views. It could be an indication that the functionality and usability of the currency is finally built out in a way that encourages adoption. Or, he suggested, bitcoin may be experiencing a secondary lift from the money that has been being plowed into token sales.\nVoorhees, on the other hand, refused to identify a single driver for the price.\n\"Prices tend to move because hundreds of thousands or millions of actors are making millions of individual different decisions. And we don’t know what all those are. This is a complex system,\" he said.\nBoth, however, agreed that regulation will be one of the most determining factors that shape the extent to which bitcoin and the broader constellation of cryptocurrencies evolve.\nVoorhees for his part, called for a hands-off regulatory stance, holding up the Internet as a somewhat idealized example of unfettered innovation.\n\"[The internet's] only powerful and important because of the freedom it brought, because of how little it was touched by regulators. That was the best thing that happened to let the internet boom. And that's what I want to happen with bitcoin,\" said Voorhees, who also went on to dismiss the idea that anyone but billionaires could hold sway over regulators.\nBut if bitcoin is to deliver financial inclusion across diverse markets and cultures, regulators will necessarily have a role, argued Smith.\n\"How do we get to a place where our industry is inclusive and creates better, freer markets for the whole world?\" he said, concluding:\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift.\nImage by Morgen Peck for CoinDesk",

    "summary": "ChangeTip has announced that former Blockchain product manager Dan Held will join its team as VP of product management.",
    "content": "Just one week after raising $3.5m from an impressive cast of VC firms, bitcoin micropayments startup ChangeTip has announced Dan Held will join its team as VP of product management.\nThe acquisition will potentially provide ChangeTip with an experienced addition to its growing team, as Held most recently served as a product manager at bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain and formerly co-founded real-time news and market data app ZeroBlock, a startup that was purchased by Blockchain in an undisclosed deal in late 2013.\nIn an interview regarding the move, Held expressed his intent to help grow ChangeTip's daily active user totals, even amid its recent surge in popularity. The ambitions are notable given the company's claims to have processed 10,000 transactions in a single day.\nHeld told CoinDesk:\nOverall, Held lauded the work of his former employer, while acknowledging that the move may have been made on short notice.\n\"Blockchain is a really cool company, they have a lot of exciting products and they've stepped up to the major leagues, developing products for potentially millions of users,\" he said.\nHeld indicated that the transition is indicative of his desire to work for a company that could help bitcoin go mainstream by appealing to a more novice audience. Further, he also cited Blockchain's aim to consolidate its offices outside San Francisco as another reason for his departure.\nBlockchain, which most recently raised an industry-record $30.5m this October, reported that overall product management will continue without interruption as employee Keonne Rodriguez has served as product lead for Blockchain’s core product since June.\n\"We’d like to thank Dan for his time on the Blockchain team. We wish him the best at ChangeTip as we are excited to see what the team is building there,\" Blockchain CEO Nic Cary told CoinDesk.\nHeld's last day at Blockchain will be 14th December.\nBuilding momentum\nDespite the recent increase in interest surrounding ChangeTip, Held framed the company as a startup that is only just beginning to deliver on its potential.\nIn particular, he cited the team's recent addition of former Bitcoin Magazine and CoinDesk contributor Victoria van Eyk as its VP of community development as key to the firm's recent success and a sign of the company's momentum.\n\"I think ChangeTip has a pretty serious team,\" he said. \"CEO Nick Sullivan and COO John Smith are really, really smart and experienced guys. Victoria and I are more bitcoin-centric, I think we're in a spot where we can identify features and products that people will love to use.\"\nHeld said he met Sullivan at a recent event held by the company and bitcoin API specialist Chain, and that this meeting quickly blossomed into a mutual desire for collaboration.\n\"I think a lot of our vision is aligned, and when Nick laid out his vision for ChangeTip, from there on I knew I had to be part of it,\" he explained.\nNew challenges\nHeld suggested he has been brought on board by ChangeTip to help it accelerate its growth due to his established history working on consumer-facing bitcoin products. At the time of its purchase, for example, ZeroBlock was the most-reviewed and highest-rated bitcoin app on the Apple iOS App Store.\n\"At the core of it, you have to remember that ZeroBlock is an everyday app for a consumer,\" he explained \"So from day one, we thought, 'How do you make an app that's complex, boil down the parts and make a really fun, intuitive user interface where people can use the app?\"\nHeld went on to suggest that ChangeTip will bring a new set of challenges when compared to his most recent position. \"While Blockchain is a wallet, ChangeTip is kind of your hot, hot wallet, it's money in your pocket wallet,\" he said.\nWhile Blockchain strives to educate its users about private key security and other more nuanced facets of bitcoin ownership, Held said, ChangeTip caters to a different audience.\n\"With ChangeTip, I'm able to focus on the really fun aspects of bitcoin and that's what's so exciting about it,\" he added.\nUltimately, however, he suggested that he sees long-term potential in the company's approach, concluding:\nDan Held image courtesy of ChangeTip",

    "title": "\"I Love the Blockchain, Just Not Bitcoin\"",
    "summary": "An open letter to the people who argue that only the blockchain holds true value and can survive without bitcoin the currency.",
    "content": "In an age of microblogging and relentless conferencing, zeitgeist is not written in novels but in phrases shorter than 140 characters.\nOne cannot leave a FinTech or digital currency conference without hearing some rendition of \"I love the blockchain, just not bitcoin\". However, as with most clichés, the phrase actually addresses the core of the issue: it begs for a defense of blockchains and the bitcoin blockchain as the best in-class.\nBlockchains are data structures that have two distinct features:\nThe title of this article addresses a key challenge that has been the cause for much debate in the industry: do we need to have only one native token with a fixed supply in our data structure, or could we have none – or many?\nTo miss the value of these native tokens would be to also miss the value of the data structures that store them. I would like to push for blockchains with native tokens rather than just blockchains (innovative, probabilistically immutable databases) which have far lower utility, if any at all.\nSecurity and integrity\nWithout going into the technical details of how blockchains are secured, it's important to understand the native token as the incentive mechanism for the security and integrity of the blockchain (for those that want a technical overview of the security model see the dynamic-membership multi-party signatures explained in the recent sidechains whitepaper).\nAt the base level, the blockchain technology is a data structure that contains within it a chain of proofs that must hold true. This structure allows us to verify that the history of transactions or information that is being presented has not been altered or tampered with, ensuring data integrity.\nThe reliability of the proofs is directly dependent on the economic incentives provided to the people or organizations that supply the proofs.\nIn bitcoin, a miner that earns the right to publish a block on the main chain is currently paid 25 BTC (roughly $9,500 at publication time). This provides adequate incentives to have highly specialized hardware running in data centers around the world.\nIf the reward halved, as it is set to do in 2016, the incentive to provide these proofs would halve and we could likely see a scenario where the proofs would then be far less reliable (partly due to the excess hardware that could be bought on the cheap). In other words, without a high token value on a blockchain, there is little security or integrity of the data contained within.\nUniversal financial coverage\nThere are relatively few bitcoin business models out there that are truly harnessing the ability to provide universal financial coverage, due to a number of factors like supply chain limitations, regulatory barriers and bitcoin’s volatility. Isn’t then the obvious solution to do away with bitcoin and keep the blockchain?\nWithout a native token, though, and with only a decentralized and open ledger we cannot achieve universal financial coverage. Financial institutions that adopt, co-opt, or fork the blockchain technology will produce no better financial coverage than they do at present.\nTo see why this is the case, we can look at the following examples of applications that have been built on the basis of financial coverage (note this is not an endorsement of any of these services, rather an examination of their use of universal financial coverage).\nThe Dogetipbot and more recently Changetip have created a frenzy on Reddit. A simple web scraper enables people around the globe to transmit value by typing a few words into a website.\nThe tips themselves are all recorded in centralized databases so the “low cost” of cryptocurrencies is irrelevant. The important factor is that the coverage is truly universal and that any user can, when they choose, withdraw the bitcoin or dogecoin from the service and use it in their everyday life.\nIn the future, this could become the basis of integrating virtual realities with physical processes.\nDrug marketplaces needing to avoid criminal clampdowns and deliver truly global marketplaces require universal financial coverage (as well as relative anonymity). The extent of the coverage enables these platforms to gain critical mass to win the trust of their user base. Cross-country supply chain integration is possible because of the extent of financial inclusion.\nGambling sites are some of the only places in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that do not give dollar or fiat equivalent currency units. Sites like SatoshiDice and Updown give the bettors information on the extent of the house edge.\nThe volumes going through these sites are incredibly impressive considering that the operators often conceal their identity and are potentially operating illegally in certain parts of the world.\nThe demand for transactions is somewhat insulated from bitcoin volatility since the house edge can be as large as 70% on a binary option. Their user growth and reputation was again only achievable due to the universal financial coverage (bitcoin) and ability to independently audit their processes (blockchain).\nOne of the most popular bitcoin casinos, Just-Dice, conducts their bets off-chain. Wagers are not recorded in the bitcoin blockchain and are only stored on the Just-Dice servers.\nWith over 1 billion bets made on the platform, it's clear that the key advantage is universal financial coverage. While there is not the ability to independently audit their processes via a blockchain, bitcoin casinos like Just-Dice provide provably fair gambling.\nThere is no reason that traditional gambling services could not do this as well, but we seem content to rely on their real-world reputation and the certification of their services by some gambling authority.\nModel for innovation\nThe underlying blockchain technology relies on universal financial coverage and distributed computing to achieve its value as one of the first databases with provable integrity.\nCentralized services may operate on top of the bitcoin protocol but will always face high competition due to the relatively low barriers to entry (open source software) and low switching costs (installing apps on a smart phone).\nWe are still early in our understanding of blockchain technology. The excitement around the integrity of the ledger, its openness and its potential to unlock global financial inclusion must be embraced in a holistic framework. The blockchain’s security and utility depend on its native token. Currently the most secure and reliable blockchain is clearly our dear friend bitcoin, but this does not have to be the case forever.\nThis article has been republished here with permission from the author.

    "summary": "Blockchain.info Nic Cary has given $10,000 to Puget Sound University.",
    "content": "The CEO of popular bitcoin website Blockchain.info has donated $10,000 in bitcoin to the university he attended as a student.\nNic Cary graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Business Leadership Program at Washington State's University of Puget Sound in 2007. On 11th February he gave something back, contributing 14.5 BTC to the University for its 2013-14 Alumni Fund.\n\"I was really lucky to be able to attend the University of Puget Sound and I had a wonderful experience – I developed amazing lifelong friendships and was challenged personally and academically every day,\" Cary said, adding that he wanted to get others on the road to success.\nHe believes his could be the first bitcoin gift ever given to an American college or university.\nSherry Mondou, Vice President for Finance and Administration at the university, said she was \"delighted\" when she heard Nic wanted to make the donation.\n“At the same time, we were a little uncertain how to proceed, as we had no gift policy on digital currencies and were unfamiliar with the process. But we greatly welcomed Nic’s thoughtful initiative and felt it would serve us well to learn to engage with the e-commerce world,\" she added.\nThe University won't be holding a position in bitcoin. Instead, it set up an account with bitcoin processor BitPay, which conducted the transaction based on the BTC/USD exchange rate at the time.\nWhen is the right time to donate?\nThat raises an interesting question: when is the right time to donate bitcoin? It's a volatile currency, and the price tanked just before Cary made his donation. Had he made it a week before, the University would have received around $2,200 more if it had converted that week. Should bitcoin recover from its current Gox-induced fugue state, the chances are it'll be worth that much again, or more, in time.\nHow much should donors monitor the market before sending coins that will be instantly converted to fiat?\nConnie Gallippi, sister of BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi, runs a charitable foundation called the BitGive Foundation, which focuses on bitcoin-based donations. She admits that volatility is an issue when cashing out immediately.\nMaintaining a position in donated bitcoins makes it more complex from a taxation perspective, however, and Gallippi points out that there is still no firm guidance from the IRS. BitGive will claim donations in bitcoins similar to how organizations would handle any in-kind donation of value, such as a vehicle, she told CoinDesk.\nCary is a relative newcomer to Blockchain, assuming the CEO role in November 2013. Before that he was Manager of Customer Operations at Pipelinedeals.com, a position he assumed shortly after graduating.\nThe University of Puget Sound has produced at least one other bitcoin luminary: Erik Voorhees, who sold SatoshiDice last year, graduated from there in the same year as Cary.\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.\n'Time to give' image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Leading Australian e-tailer Millennius has stopped selling iPhones to protest against Apple’s decision to remove the blockchain.info app from its app store.\nMillennius\nis a key proponent of bitcoin, and has called for wider deployment of the currency in the past. The company argues that bitcoin could lower prices online as payments are cheaper than traditional credit card payments and these savings could be passed down to consumers.\nBetraying ideals\nThe blockchain.info app was the only bitcoin-related app in Apple’s walled garden of delights, and it had more than 120,000 users. The backlash on social media has been huge and some iPhone owners even smashed their phones in protest.\n“Apple seems to have betrayed its own ideals, and those who believed in the brand,” said Millennius founder Pierre Boutros.\nBoutros admits that the move will hurt his company’s bottom line. He is calling for other bitcoin-friendly iPhone retailers to do the same, thus applying pressure on Apple to reverse its decision.\nIronically, smartphones are the best selling product sold for bitcoins via Millennius. In addition, the company points out that in the six months since it started accepting bitcoin and litecoin, it has not had a single fraudulent transaction.\n“This has only been done in response to Apple as it has so poorly communicated its reasons for such a decision,” Boutros said.\nAndroid to the rescue\nApple’s position on bitcoin is clear, as is its restrictive App Store policy. The company's guidelines been around for years, and are unlikely to change despite the backlash. Blockchain has issued a statement which was highly critical of Apple, but quick to praise rival Google.\nGoogle’s Play Store remains wide open: there’s no routine vetting, and there are already dozens of bitcoin apps for Android devices.\nBlockchain also pointed out that in removing its iOS app, Apple has eliminated competition using their monopolistic position in the market in a “heavy handed” manner.\nWhile there is no sign that cryptocurrency supporters will boycott Apple, the move might have a slight impact on sales and Apple’s reputation. In other words, it could drive a number of consumers to competing platforms – namely Android.\nOf course, another alternative for iOS fans are web-based wallets, like the HTML5/JS-based Coinpunk.",

    "title": "Thousands of Hoarded Bitcoins Flood the Block Chain in Mystery Transaction",
    "summary": "Speculation is mounting after many old bitcoins moved yesterday. Who could be responsible this time?",
    "content": "The bitcoin block chain threw out an interesting statistic yesterday: there were 134,084,960 'Bitcoin Days Destroyed'.\nIt's the highest number in bitcoin's history so far, beating the previous four record spikes which reached around 52,000,000 Bitcoin Days Destroyed respectively.\nThe Blockchain.info chart below emphasises how dramatic that looks. If you filter this data for coins that are at least one year old, it still looks like this (130,990,276).\nThis means that a lot of older bitcoins moved yesterday – a lot. Who could it be this time? Again, fingers were pointed at the typical large-volume bitcoin holders: old-time miners, large exchanges, the Winklevii, or \"something to do with Silk Road”.\nThe reality is, we can't know for sure unless there's some other hint.\nIt's important to note that this figure does not mean 130m bitcoins changed hands. One \"Bitcoin Day\" is added to every coin for every day it doesn't move to another address.\n1 BTC, unmoved for a year, will have a score of 365 Bitcoin Days. Spend it, and that 365 score will be wiped, or 'destroyed'.\nBitcoin itself has existed for 4.9 years. A single coin from one of the first blocks, unspent, would have a score of around 1,788 Bitcoin Days.\nThe fairly obscure and tricky-to-grasp \"Bitcoin Days Destroyed\" metric is essentially one way to tell how much 'actual' activity is happening in the bitcoin economy.\nThe longer a bitcoin sits around without being used, the number of 'days' it accumulates: 1 coin + 1 day = 1 Bitcoin Day. When the coin is sent somewhere, that accumulated total is said to be 'destroyed'.\nThis reddit discussion\noffers some useful insights on the subject.\nHoarder metrics\nFor another example: 5 BTC held for one day then spent is 5 days destroyed. That same 5 BTC held for a week (7 days) then spent is 5 x 7 = 35 days destroyed.\nIf you held them for a whole year, they would have accumulated 1,825 Bitcoin Days. Spend them after that long, and ... bingo! 1,825 Bitcoin Days destroyed (or the accumulated number is 'reset').\nA low number of days destroyed means more bitcoins are being hoarded. A high number - especially one as high as 130 million - means a lot of coins just got un-hoarded.\nIt may not have been 130 million, but that figure divided by even 3 years of Bitcoin Days equals over 118,000 BTC - quite a lot to move all at once.\nIn the long-term\nTo measure activity we could simply count the number of transactions, but that tells us nothing about the amount of bitcoins being kept in long-term storage, or bitcoins lost forever due to lost keys, hardware, and other regretful blunders. Seeing old coins come back into circulation is good news, as it means they're not lost.\nCounting simple transactions could also allow an individual or small group to manipulate the statistics by moving the same coins round and round.\nBut back to yesterday's statistic: who was it?\nThe answer is, we can only speculate. It's probably not from the oldest blocks, which haven't moved at all. It's also important to remember that, just because bitcoins have changed addresses, it doesn't mean that they changed hands, or were exchanged for anything.\nTop Secret image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Roger Ver on Blockchain's Past, Present and Future",
    "summary": "Roger Ver talks about his company Blockchain, dealing with regulators and the two types of bitcoin companies.",
    "content": "Last week, I sat down with Roger Ver for an exclusive, hour-long interview where we discussed his company Blockchain, his team, and his vision for the bitcoin industry.\nWe first connected after Ver came across a blog post of mine in which I dismissed Blockchain as \"too understaffed and undercapitalized\" to compete with the likes of Coinbase and Circle, long-term.\nThe man, who many have started to refer to as \"Bitcoin Jesus\", emailed me with some objections and let me know that Blockchain had tripled the size of its team in just over a month while continuing to lead the industry in web traffic, wallet users and bitcoins stored. \"By just about any metric, we are the #1 Bitcoin website in the world,\" he wrote.\nWhen Ver offered to set the record straight in a one-on-one interview, I gladly accepted.\nRyan Galt: You're actually the majority owner of Blockchain, not just a seed investor. How did you come to acquire the company from [Blockchain founder] Ben Reeves?\nRoger Ver: In late 2011, I started emailing every bitcoin website that had a half-formed business plan, asking if they needed money to expand operations. I was excited about bitcoin and wanted to help grow the ecosystem.\nBen replied because he knew who I was from [my investment in] BitInstant. He needed additional servers, and told me how much he needed. I asked him how much equity would be fair in return for that investment, and when he set the terms, I sent him the money. Then we didn't really talk for another year or so.\nGalt: He was working by himself at that point, and he didn't even talk to you?\nVer: I was available, but he didn't need me. One thing that cannot be emphasized strongly enough is how absolutely amazing Ben is. He created the entire website by himself, the iPhone app by himself, the Android app by himself, and up until nine months ago he was also running a service that allowed people to buy bitcoins through wire transfers and cash deposits in the Eurozone.\nHe was handling all of that, including customer support, by himself. But then, the powers that be in the banking system shut down his personal bank account, his business bank account and his brother's personal bank account without warning. While he's an amazing developer, he didn't want to have to deal with banks and lawyers and regulators. That's when I got more actively involved.\nGalt: What is your role today with Blockchain?\nVer: I still have responsibilities related to some of my other investments, but I am close to full-time at Blockchain now. I've been helping with recruiting and lining up advertising partners. There were implementations that Ben had done for free that now account for over $20k per month. And those customers didn't think twice about paying.\nGalt: With Blockchain, everything seems free. BitPay makes money from monthly subscriptions, Coinbase makes fees on its pseudo-exchange, and Circle will likely have a similar model. Does Blockchain make any money outside of ads?\nVer: Right now our goal is to give everything away for free. Later on when the whole market develops a bit more, maybe we'll start charging for tiered levels of access for data we have about the Bitcoin network. But we are, and will continue to be, a great advertising platform first and foremost.\nWe're the #1 bitcoin website on the internet with more eyeballs viewing our website than anyone else. We already have revenues well into the six figures per month, and we are cash flow positive, so we're in really good position.\nGalt: You guys seem radically transparent. Is it good to give away so much?\nVer: I think it's a good thing that all of our client-side code is open-source. Every once in a while, you'll see a reddit post like \"the Blockchain Chrome extension is now closed-source,\" and everyone goes crazy! It's because Ben forgot to push the latest update to Github.\nBut all these people complaining about our supposed \"closed-source\" update, don't seem to realize that Bitstamp, Coinbase, Mt. Gox and Kraken have been completely closed-source from day one. We're a contrast to that. It's part of the philosophy we're developing at Blockchain: support the community, be open with people and build out Bitcoin.\nGalt: How does Blockchain plan to work with regulators? Do you feel you have any responsibility for compliance with anti-money laundering and know your customer laws?\n[post-quote]\nVer: We have a world-class legal team working hard to ensure we don't fall under any of those regulations. The way our wallet is designed means we never have access to anybody's bitcoins. We don't have the ability to freeze accounts or block transactions or control anybody's bitcoins.\nAs the law is written currently, that means we are not a money transmitter or a money services business. From that standpoint, we're probably the best bitcoin business out there because we don't deal with any regulatory craziness.\nGalt: You and some of your teammates, especially Andreas Antonopoulos, are outspoken when it comes to the illegitimacy of government regulators. Do you feel bitcoin can be regulated?\nVer: At the end of the day, no, Bitcoin the protocol can't be regulated. Obviously, men with guns wearing costumes are scary, but a gun can't change the mathematics behind Bitcoin.\nOur goal with Blockchain is to provide the software tools that everyone on the planet can use to send and receive bitcoins to anyone else on the planet without needing permission.\nGalt: But without regulations and integration with the financial system, do you think bitcoin can grow to mass scale?\nVer: I do, but it would certainly be a slower process. To be fair, Coinbase and others like them [that offer these regulated services] are incredibly valuable, and offer an easy user interface to buy and sell bitcoins. There's definitely a need for things like Coinbase in the ecosystem, but at the end of the day I sure wouldn't store my bitcoins in a system like that.\nGalt: Why do you say that?\nVer: At some point, because of the way that systems like Coinbase are designed, it's just a matter of time before the regulators come in and say \"freeze this account\" or \"undo this transaction\".\nAt the instant people realize that their bitcoins can be seized or frozen while stored in a Coinbase wallet, they will flock to a service like Blockchain where accounts can't be frozen. In the long-run, we think that will be the strongest selling point of Blockchain. We can't help you recover your password, but nobody on the planet can take your bitcoins if you use a secure password and don't forget it.\nThe bad case scenario is for an authority to come along and say \"give me Roger Ver's bitcoins\". But the worst case scenario, which is the scary one, is for someone to come along and say \"give us everyone's bitcoins\". That's a real problem with \"off-blockchain\" systems like Coinbase. We're totally \"on-blockchain\".\nGalt: What do you mean by \"off-blockchain\" versus \"on-blockchain\"?\nVer: We think the bitcoin industry will be split into two worlds. You'll have \"on-blockchain\" businesses that stay true to the unregulated, decentralized principles of Bitcoin, and \"off-blockchain\" businesses with fiat business models that must comply with all local regulations as a result.\nApple's iOS versus Google's Android is a good analogy: the \"walled garden\" versus the truly open platform. The iOS ecosystem is closed, tidy, and sanitized. The Android ecosystem is disorganized, self-emergent, and messy. The market has room for both.\nWe'd compare Coinbase and Circle to Apple and Blockchain to Android. We think following \"on-blockchain\" principles is the best way to build a bitcoin business.\nGalt: Interesting, but this seems like a niche approach. Do you think mainstream consumers would ever opt for an \"on-blockchain\" model if it meant there was no way to recover passwords, and they were 100% responsible for being their own bank?\nVer: When you say \"niche\", I disagree. Think about the \"other six billion\". Most people outside of the developed world especially would rather be their own banks than have password recovery options from their local bank.\nGalt: After speaking with some of your team, it seems you are all aligned in terms of your core bitcoin philosophy. That said, the team is spread across four continents. How do you manage that?\nVer: Obviously, the key is building a culture and finding people who embrace bitcoin's openness and decentralization. I think it's clear Blockchain's is the wallet design that holds truest to Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin.\nLogistically speaking, we tend to coalesce around one place and travel as a nomadic tribe. We've congregated in 12 cities across four continents in the past two months.\nGalt: So to wrap up, the billion dollar question: why do you think Blockchain will succeed where others may not?\nVer: We have a first -mover advantage and fundamentally our design is better. Coinbase and Circle will always be at the beck and call of every regulator because those companies control their users' deposits.\nWith Blockchain, we don't have the ability to do anything an authority would ask us to do. That decentralized approach will allow us to continue to dominate the market.\nYou can read the full interview here.\nImage credit: Flickr / LeWeb\nRyan Galt is a blogger, entrepreneur and freelance opinion writer for CoinDesk.

    "summary": "From big cities to small villages – all around the world we are seeing a common current that weaves together the diverse actions of ordinary people.",
    "content": "“We are free to plant our own seeds; we don’t buy the brand nor the patent from a multinational. In order to plant, we don’t need permission. Also, we don’t ask anyone’s permission for what to do with our money!”\nSantiago Zaz is an organic farmer from Argentina. Back in 2013, Zaz’s business became the first of its kind to accept bitcoin payments in the country.\nLike Zaz, many in his community don’t have the possibility of owning a credit card. Instead, it was the adoption of cryptocurrency and its decentralized ethos that made the expansion of his business possible.\nA similar sentiment is echoed in Shannon County, South Dakota – the second poorest county in the US. Payu Harris, a resident of the Pine Ridge Indian reservation who traces his ancestry to the Northern Cheyene, recently told Forbes “I want the native people to embrace bitcoin.”\nFurthermore, he spoke about his passion to free his people from the American government through cryptocurrency. Calling it “the nerd’s revenge”, the 38-year-old digital currency trader and activist said that “bitcoin is a way of getting involved in big finance without being a Harvard grad or part of the Wall Street elite” and that it “opens the door for the common man to get involved”.\nFrom big cities to villages and Indian reservations – all around the world we are seeing a common current that weaves the diverse actions of ordinary people. They are finding an avenue in cryptocurrencies for economic self-determination.\nHowever, it is the invention of blockchain technology that makes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin possible.\nFirst introduced in 2008 in a white paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the core of this invention is 'distributed trust' that can achieve consensus amongst strangers on a large scale.\nBut just what is the decentralized trust that forms the foundation of this technology?\nDecentralized trust\nIn the current centralized financial systems, trust is mediated by a hierarchical outer authority. This intermediary discourages the two parties (financial providers and consumers) from developing personal relations of trust as a fundamental element in their transaction.\nBitcoin offers a new trust model. Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and author Andreas Antonopoulos describes bitcoin’s security model as \"trust by computation\":\nBitcoin's decentralized trust eliminates the need for any centralized authority and brings the source of legitimacy in the realm of finance back to individuals.\nAnyone can download an application on their computer or smart phone and start their own money system or bank. Trust that is generated horizontally becomes an essential undercurrent of exchange.\nBy choosing to abide with algorithmic consensus, we participate in creating a society based on our trust in ourselves and our fellows.\nUnmediated flow\nThis emerging 'networked trust' unleashes something that has been stagnated by hierarchical institutions. With bitcoin, currency regains its true meaning – flow.\nAntonopoulos has described how currency comes from the word for ‘flow’ in Latin, adding that \"there never was a currency that had flow like bitcoin, which has no borders, no checkpoints, no intermediaries.\"\nUntil now, economic activities have been geared to bend toward the rich, while bitcoin’s neutrality works to rebalance power toward economic justice. The blockchain-based approach to economic interaction works toward empowering the masses whenever the scales of power are out of balance.\nThe effect of this unmediated flow is especially powerful in the remittance market, which has become a massive global financial instrument for exploitation through currency exchange and international transfer.\nA recent article highlighted the potential impact bitcoin could have in the remittance industry, through which monopolies have made profits somewhere between $400bn and $530bn in 2012 and which is expected to grow to over $680bn in the coming years according to a World Bank report.\nPayment networks like PayPal are blocked in many developing countries. When bitcoin is used appropriately and responsibly it can help people avoid the usurious behavior of money transfer companies like Western Union. Author Richard Boase argued this innovation has the potential to “help spur growth and development in the world’s poorest economies”.\nIn addition to bitcoin’s potential for transforming the remittance industry, it could alter the bureaucratically-controlled avenues of foreign aid. Much of the money that is currently being captured by institutionalized hierarchies could instead be freed to improve the lives of the poorest people around the globe.\nCurrency of the oppressed\nFor many in the West, bitcoin may seem like just another speculative bubble.\nWhile it may be more of an investment tool for some, it offers a fundamental avenue for liberation and survival for others. Bitcoin’s autonomous flow is quickly becoming the bank-less and government-less currency of the oppressed.\nAdoption is happening in places where governments tightly control the currency and hyper-inflate hard-earned work and value through harsh austerity and money printing.\nIn March 2013, a crisis of forced austerity hit the small Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus, when the government closed the country’s second largest bank in return for an international bailout by Eurogroup, the European Commission and European Central Bank. People rushed to protect their savings.\nWhile Cypriots took to the streets to protest, some turned to bitcoin as a safe haven from the government stealing their savings.\nA similar trend is occurring in Argentina. Early this year the national currency, the Peso fell in its steepest loss since the country’s 2002 economic collapse. Many Argentinians are moving to bitcoin as a safe haven.\nTess Bennett reported on how the growing popularity of cryptocurrency-freedom in Argentina is creating the largest community of bitcoin users in Latin America. At the first Latin American Bitcoin Conference in Buenos Aires in 2012, Belgium investment advisor Tuur Demeester passionately expressed the true meaning of the ‘Bitcoin Revolution’, saying “bitcoin marks the end of monetary apartheid” and “the end of financial discrimination and segregation based on nationality and political privilege”.\nThe other six billion\nThese disruptive flows represent emerging power from the margins.\nThe blockchain distributed trust network is open to everyone and responds to all people indiscriminately, regardless of their economic status, nationality or credit history. It brings people who are generally excluded into the circle of consensus.\nAntonopoulos speaks of how bitcoin is all about the other six billion and points out how they need this, not for speculation, but for liberation.\nA new World Bank research paper indicates that under the current financial arrangement, 2.5 billion people across the planet are unbanked. Antonopoulos expands this number, portraying this essentially unbanked population as the six billion that includes those underbanked who have limited ability to interact with the rest of the world due to radical currency debasement as well as a lack of small business investment capital and high transfer fees.\nThe invention of blockchain distributed trust has the potential to empower those in the peripheries who have been exploited by the systems of Western financial hegemony and to generate bottom up consensus power.\nThis can collectively redirect the flow of currency that has until now been channeled toward the top to instead support grassroots economic activities and social interaction that benefit more people.\nThe rise of the blockchain network is poised to disrupt the world as we know it. The time has come for us to reclaim the power of self-determination and build our common future through this flow of networked trust.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.\nTrust image via Shutterstock",

Our customer service is available 24x7, and most inquiries are resolved within minutes.\"\nHe added the coming year would see OKCoin launch in additional markets around the world, supporting more currencies, and providing better service to users in the international community.\nBlockchain role\nIt might have been a short time, but Zhao's period at Blockchain covered much of that company's stellar transformation from a one-man labour of love in early 2013, to a team of four by the end of 2013, and on to the large distributed multinational and world's most popular bitcoin storage service it has now become.\nAs Head of Development, Zhao oversaw the company's promotion in the Asian region, as well as product development for its API and acquisition of information service ZeroBlock, as well as other operations, including infrastructure and security.\nPrior to entering the bitcoin world, Zhao was the co-founder of Fusion Systems, and Global Head of IT at Bloomberg Tradebook Futures.\nThe road to bitcoin\nThe multilingual Zhao first got into bitcoin on the recommendation of Ron Cao, Managing Director of Lightspeed Venture Partners and a personal friend, after he had invested $5m in OKCoin's competitor BTC China last August.\nBTC China's CEO Bobby Lee, another friend, also advised him to convert 10% of his net worth into bitcoins.\nZhao then proceeded to study in every way he could, by reading Satoshi's White Paper, combing the bitcointalk forums, attending a few conferences, and trying out bitcoin for himself.\nWith the bitcoin price rising steadily before he'd bought a single satoshi, he quit his job and began looking for full time work in the bitcoin sphere. This in turn led to Roger Ver and Blockchain, which he joined last January.\nBelief in China\nDespite recent tribulations, the future for bitcoin exchanges in China is still bright, he said, and his move to OKCoin reflects the sort of personal confidence he maintains in the industry:\nAmicable departure\nZhao said his departure from Blockchain was an amicable one, and that he remained on very friendly terms with the team there.\n\"Blockchain is one of the most inspirational companies I have ever had the pleasure to work with,\" he said. \"It’s also one of the best bitcoin companies around. At the same time, there are other great companies. OKCoin is definitely one of them.\"",

    "title": "Apple’s Virtual Currency Policy Update: Good or Bad for Bitcoin?",
    "summary": "While the company's update regarding the use of virtual currencies is intriguing, it doesn't necessarily mean acceptance.",
    "content": "Amid the excitement surrounding Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, there were a few updates made to Apple's App Store Guidelines – some of which concerned the use of 'virtual currencies' in the iOS ecosystem.\nWhile it is intriguing that additional information regarding the use of virtual currencies was added, it doesn't necessarily mean acceptance. In fact, it might actually mean more pronounced and detailed rejection.\nPurchasing and currencies\nOne new addendum commonly being cited is the rule under “purchasing and currencies\", specifically rule 11.17. It states:\nThe wording of this means that Apple still has authority to reject bitcoin apps. And bitcoin wallets, by Apple, are generally rejected when they include sending functionality.\nThe idea of \"approved virtual currencies\" suggests that Apple is keeping tabs on such currencies in order to permit specific use.\nAlso, the use of the word \"compliance\", and the regulatory situation many bitcoin companies operate in, many of them without regulatory approval, affords Apple additional scrutiny.\nYet some bitcoin companies might dispute this.\nGliph is one such firm, and late last year its messaging app had its bitcoin-sending features abruptly removed. In a blog post regarding the policy updates, Gliph stated:\nHope for app developers\nThe wording of \"virtual currencies\" in Apple's guidelines may send some people's emotions aflutter for bitcoin wallets on iOS.\n— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 3, 2014\nBut Apple might just be laying down the law with this statement, rather than loosening up.\n\"I think they just put a very specific policy on it. It seems like they updated so that they could be clear to all potential bitcoin companies,\" said Lamar Wilson, who owns iPhone wallet app, Pheeva.\nWilson uses a sign-up process that puts users into a private cooperative, thus enabling him to skirt Apple's rules on actually sending bitcoin funds from within apps.\n\"We’d love to launch a full app in the store, at some point. But launching the app would not negate our relationship with the cooperative at all,\" he said.\nBlockchain.info, one of the largest wallet providers, had its bitcoin app removed from the App Store earlier this year. Yet the company is hopeful that there will be positive developments related to the policy updates.\nDan Held, Director of Product at Blockchain.info, told CoinDesk:\nNo change?\nGliph, which had bitcoin sending functions on iOS removed at the behest of Apple last year, continues to keep watch over the situation.\nRob Banagale, the company's CEO, makes note of another update to the policy that most people are perhaps overlooking.\nUnder Use of the In-App Purchase API, in Section 2.2, the Apple policy states that there are restrictions on currencies.\nThis policy includes, \"Currency for exchange, gifting, redemption, transfer, trading or use in purchasing or obtaining anything within or outside of Your Application.\"\nIt goes on to add a definition of currency as follows:\nIt will be interesting to see how this shakes out. Many developers seem optimistic about the clarification, yet, at the same time, those who have to deal with repeated rejections from Apple seem to think little has actually changed.\nThe company is well-known for believing it can curate an experience that users cannot get anywhere else. But users can get one thing elsewhere – a fully functional bitcoin wallet. And the latest announcement may be, at least, some recognition that there is demand for that.\niPhone maze image via Canadapanda / Shutterstock",

    "summary": "In a new application released by the USPTO, Apple describes how it might use a blockchain-based platform to generate and secure timestamps.",
    "content": "A new patent application from U.S. electronics giant Apple points to the potential use of blockchain within a prospective system for creating and verifying timestamps.\nIn an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, Apple details a program able to certify timestamps by combining aspects of blockchain technology with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) tools.\nThe use case in question involves tying a piece of information to a particular transaction on a blockchain, establishing the state of that data at a particular point in time. Should that information be changed, additional transactions can be created that detail changes to the data.\nApple's application describes three possible methods for establishing timestamps, with one of these scenarios centering around a blockchain platform.\nThe program would generate a block containing a timestamp, with every subsequent block being added as miners verify each transaction conducted on the chain. This system is part of what Apple is calling a \"multi-check architecture,\" meaning that another system would confirm the timestamp after the block is generated but before it is added to the chain.\nAccording to the application, Apple would consider using a blockchain due to the decentralized security features it offers.\nAs the document notes:\nThe benefit of using a decentralized ledger to store timestamps is two-fold, according to the application. Not only can the proper time be maintained permanently, it states, but the network is also protected from corruption if a single node is compromised by malicious actors.\nImage Credit: View Apart / Shutterstock.com",

    "content": "More than a day after bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.info first indicated it was experiencing a severe outage, its services have been fully restored, a company blog post has revealed.\nIssues began with Blockchain noting that it had suspended SharedCoin transactions in what was initially suspected to be a short delay. However, that announcement, made on 17th March, proceeded a long period of downtime that extended into the late evening the next day.\nBlockchain updated users that all Blockchain services were operational again as of 10pm PST, 18th March.\n— Blockchain.info (@blockchain) March 19, 2014\nThe company had originally indicated that the problems stemmed from an 'unusual database issue', though the problem was later revealed to be the result of an error that affected several tables meant to track information contained in the bitcoin blockchain ledger.\nBlockchain stated that though the problem was easy to identify, fixing the issue proved challenging due to the size of the affected data sets.\nExplained Blockchain's security and distributed systems expert Andreas Antonopoulos:\nBlockchain has promised a forthcoming 'post-mortem' report on the issue that will elaborate further on the facts within the next few days.\nContinued issues\nIn his written comments, Antonopoulos expressed his thanks to the company's consumer and business users for their patience while it worked to correct the issue.\nAt press time, however, Blockchain had issued another blog post detailing additional problems being experienced by some users, though they were unrelated to the larger outage.\nBlockchain indicated that the company is currently working to address an issue being experienced by existing iPhone users, and that SharedCoin would continue to remain offline.\nIt reassured iPhone users that all funds are currently accounted for despite the glitch.\nBlockchain's response\nIn contrast to measures taken by other high-profile companies during outages, the Blockchain team was unusually communicative about issues, releasing five blog posts between the initial message and the final declaration that services would be restored.\nIn between, the company stressed to users that it was dedicating its efforts to restoring services, and reiterated to users that no funds were affected by the error.\nThe blockchain team was active updating users on reddit - posting multiple, live edits to messages, and in responding to frustrated users on Twitter in what amounted to an agressive PR campaign to educate and assure users.\n— Blockchain.info (@blockchain) March 19, 2014\nCommunity reaction\nBlockchain's response to the ordeal was greeted positively by the digital currency community, with many lauding the willingness of the team to remain open about problems and progress.\n— CryptoBucket (@CryptoBucket) March 19, 2014\nMt. Gox was roundly criticized for its silence in the wake of massive theft and its eventual insolvency. Further, what statements it did issue did little to stem frustration and caused huge sell offs among investors.\nThough Blockchain's efforts seem to have avoided such mistakes, some remained unsatisfied with the efforts.\n— Cuke King (@cukeking) March 19, 2014\nNext steps\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, CEO Nicolas Cary indicated that Blockchain would embark on a large-scale review of the service issues.\nCary indicated that the company would continue its policy of remaining open with users and any and all concerns.\n\"We've just started our post-mortem research and it will be a few days before we have comprehensive documentation of the incident. [...] We will be publishing the entire account on our blog so the whole Bitcoin community can learn from this.\"\nAntonopoulos also expressed his frustration at the outage, vowing that more work would be done to restore user confidence in the coming days and weeks.\n\"We take pride in our work and care deeply about our customers, so this outage was humbling and painful for us too. We will do everything we can to regain your trust and make sure this doesn’t happen again.\"",

    "summary": "Blockchain.info is the world's most popular bitcoin site and online wallet, with over 3 million visitors last month alone.",
    "content": "CoinDesk spoke to Nicolas and Ben of Blockchain.info about it being the #1 bitcoin site, how it will remain so into the future, why its users trust it so much and how online wallets need to be easy to use as well as secure.\nThe Blockchain.info team has been busy. The site grew by over 50% last month, with over 118 million page views and over 3 million unique visitors in November 2013. The number of registered bitcoin wallets jumped from 500,000 at the start of the month to 800,000 at the end and is now on its way to 1 million. These 'My Wallet' users engage in about 24,000 transactions daily, sending about 150,000 BTC in total.\nThat's quite a change from January 2013, when the site boasted \"over 110,000 users.\" Even in August, daily transactions were around 100,000 BTC (worth $12m at the time). Due to the way Blockchain's encryption works, it is impossible to know the total number of bitcoins stored there.\nServices\nBlockchain.info has grown to be not only the #1 most visited bitcoin-related site, but arguably also the most compelling and most-often quoted. If the block chain itself is bitcoin's raw narrative told in some incomprehensible language, then Blockchain.info is its interpreter.\nThe clean, bare-bones design appeals to statistics geeks and bitcoin newcomers alike, with a simple search box to recover information on transaction IDs, bitcoin addresses, or IP addresses. There's a page of various developer APIs providing access to every kind of useful data on the bitcoin economy with a simple message: \"Services provided by Blockchain.info are free of charge. Please do not abuse them.\"\nThe My Wallet service has grown to such proportions that it will soon be spun off to a separate property, Blockchain.com. The team plans to offer a raft of new payment services to wallet users upon logging in, such as the ability to acquire bitcoins from popular exchanges or spending them for gift cards with Gyft. They also hope to add options like bill-paying and other shopping opportunities.\nThe basic block chain explorer \"Always has been, always will be a free service\" to support research, media and institutional investors.\nLooking to the future\nBlockchain.info did all this despite its team being (for the moment) also quite bare-bones. In fact, until the spring of 2013 Blockchain was just one person: software developer Ben Reeves. But then bitcoin started heading to the moon and Blockchain had to grow to handle all its users, of both the data and the bitcoin wallet service.\nThere are currently five people on the Blockchain team, spread around the world: two in Yorkshire, UK; two in New Hampshire, USA; and one in Japan. Even then, it's rare to catch every member in their home country at a given time and the five-strong team is no longer enough.\n\"We're growing and hiring a world class team to help manage our development, infrastructure, and user base. A careers page will be going up on the site any day now,\" said Nicolas Cary, Blockchain's second employee.\nThe team agrees mass adoption and mobile access are both essential to bitcoin's success. Blockchain is currently the only native mobile wallet app available on all major platforms. Cary said:\n\"We're ready to bring on the next generation of users. This is going to be disruptive tech for remittances, etc. I want the doors to be open to people experimenting, We will spend all our resources and every waking moment making (Blockchain) the most advanced and usable option.\"\nThe company also pays and transacts entirely in bitcoin.\n\"We are a 100% fiat-less company; maybe the first in the world. We have ZERO endpoints into the 'real-world' economy, and the few remaining services we pay for personally we're converting one at a time,\" Cary said.\nOnline wallet security\nAs a wallet service that exists online, Blockchain is extremely conscious of security issues and the bad press online wallets have received due to lax security, bad code, or corrupt operators.\nCary points to an article recently published on a major technology news blog that warned people away from all online services, with a hint of irritation:\n\"I thought it was an irresponsible article. It makes me mad to see stories about online wallets being a bad idea. Cold storage is great, but if you want to use bitcoin every day then you need some sort of portable storage that's easy to access.\"\nHe's also annoyed that Blockchain tends to get referenced somewhere in any story about an online wallet being compromised, though this probably comes with the territory of being the most well-known.\nBlockchain suffered probably its only significant breach in August 2013 when 50 BTC was stolen from some addresses within wallets. The issue was caused by insecurities either in JavaScript's random number generator or the Android OS itself. Blockchain refunded all lost funds to users.\nCustomers also lost funds due to insecure passwords, not using two-factor authentication, or simply by misplacing their access credentials. Earlier in the spring, Ben Reeves realized he couldn't handle the sheer number of support tickets by himself, so decided to expand the team, and started building the legal framework to turn his hobby into a serious company.\n\"We have a responsibility to defend the technology [of online wallets],\" said Cary.\nBlockchain's wallet service is set up in a way that users shouldn't need to be concerned about security infrastructure on the server side. All the important encryption related to the security of users' bitcoins happens on the client side, in the browser or on a mobile device.\nIt stores an encrypted backup of user wallets on Blockchain's servers so they may be accessed from various places and devices, but do not store user passwords anywhere. The relevant JavaScript code is downloaded from Blockchain's servers every time a user logs in.\nCary said that although client side encryption was important and provided a strong buffer against any server side security issues, the company also takes its server security very seriously. Blockchain is hosted on a dedicated privately owned hardware and is protected by hardware based intrusion protection and packet inspection. Wallets are encrypted with a master key and backed up to Amazon S3 with each update.\nCary said:\nBlockchain also has \"several monitoring systems in place both internally and externally\" to ensure code is being served as expected, and the developers are confident that a security breach such as a modified server occurred, it would be caught quickly.\nSuch a risk did not exist for users of the Blockchain apps for Android and iOS, the Mac app or the browser extensions, and Cary recommended these as the most secure ways to log in.\nSticking to principles\nBlockchain's live transaction stream is hypnotic, and watching a whole economy's every interaction stream live provides an understanding of bitcoin's elegance and power. Behind those numbers and confirmations there's shopping, trading, gambling wins and losses, grievous user mistakes and crime.\nAnd it all flows in full, undiscriminating public view like no other economy before it.\nMost transactions are in the region of 0.1 BTC, 0.01 BTC. Then there's 4.99 BTC and suddenly, a 100.4 BTC transaction appears. They both slip out of view amongst the rest. Blockchain.info's interface for riding the stream is as elegant as bitcoin's block chain itself, and its fascination with simple transaction data was one of the primary motivations for setting up the site in the first place.\nThe purpose and politics of bitcoin are as important to the current Blockchain team as the integrity of their code. Ben Reeves himself comes from a computer science background, not finance, and the team tries to \"live and breathe the business\" in their borderless, perpetually moving lifestyles.\n\"At this time we have no desire to be an exchange whatsoever,\" said Cary, adding:\n\"The real stories are happening on the core protocol and the investments being made there. It's the less glamorous side but it's the important one.\"\n\"When we joined together and discussed how we all came to bitcoin, what our core values were. We said we're going to build something that makes a better world through better money.\"\n\"Success for us is the adoption of bitcoin. Does it have pecuniary rewards for us? Of course. But we're not interested in swimming in a pool of bitcoins like Scrooge McDuck. We're interested in the disruption, the community, that's what makes it fun,\" he concluded.\nChain image via Shutterstock",

The blockchain system would subsequently solve the state's existing data collection and retention issues, and create a more secure record.\nIf passed, the bill would direct Colorado's chief information security officer to evaluate the costs and benefits of using distributed ledgers in various government systems, and to determine blockchain's capability in handling cyberattacks compared to traditional computer systems.\nIn 2017, according to the bill, there were somewhere between six and eight million attempted breaches of the Colorado state government's digital platforms per day.\nMany of the records kept by the government are unsecured, and therefore are \"valuable targets for identity thieves and hackers with the intent to steal or penetrate corporate records.\" The bill went on to note that there is an increasing number of threats to steal personal information.\nIn addition, the bill pointed out that Colorado currently still requires citizens to visit state agencies in person to modify their information, a pain-point that can be solved by a blockchain system.\nThe bill went on:\nColorado flags image via Shutterstock",

Users who choose to pay in bitcoin receive 3% back on their purchases, which is added into a points system, earning them discounts for future purchases.\nThe news comes shortly after reports of Apple’s revised stance on apps that “facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies”. The tech giant angered its iPhone users in February by removing the Coinbase and Blockchain apps from the iOS app store.\nEarlier this month, it issued a statement saying that such apps may now run so long as they “do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions”.\n“Our users are ecstatic about it,” said Gyft’s chief executive Vinny Lingham. “The moment we heard the rules were being relaxed we wanted to get it up and running as soon as possible.”\nCiting DISH Network and Expedia as recent adopters of the digital currency, he said:\nLingham and his clients are not alone. Blockchain CEO Nic Cary revealed on Twitter yesterday that his company's wallet app would soon return to the iOS store.\n— Nic Cary (@niccary) June 18, 2014\nHe told CoinDesk: “We were very encouraged by Apple's recent policy adjustment and immediately dusted off our original app. Ever since January we've been hoping Apple would change it's stance and it seems like they've finally listened to their users … Finally, millions of bitcoin enthusiasts will get to experience bitcoin on their iPhones.”\nLast week, a new bitcoin wallet app appeared for download in the iOS App Store. The Coinpocket app has a number of basic features, but also enables users to generate a BIP38 encrypted version of their private key.\nGyft CEO Vinny Lingham will be speaking at CoinSummit in London on July 10-11.\nImage via Gyft",

    "summary": "Marco Santori is leaving Cooley to become president and chief legal officer of Blockchain, a longtime client and one of the earliest wallet startups.",
    "content": "One of the first and most influential lawyers to represent blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses is joining one of the industry's oldest startups in an executive role.\nAnnounced today, Marco Santori is leaving Cooley LLP, where he's been a partner since November 2016, to become the president and chief legal officer of Blockchain, a longtime client and one of the industry's best-known wallet startups.\nThe move is a return to roots for Santori, who started out advising early bitcoin startups on legal and policy matters but over the years shifted to working on enterprise blockchains and, most recently, initial coin offerings.\nBut he said his heart was always in bitcoin's potential to empower individuals.\n\"I didn't get into this to do ICOs,\" Santori told CoinDesk. \"It's a fascinating area of the law, but that's not the train that I'm on.\"\nLikewise, he said:\nBlockchain is the best place for him to fulfill that vision, Santori said. The company, which has offices in New York and London, allows users to store and send bitcoin through their web browsers without downloading any software.\nIt's raised a total of $70 million to date. According to co-founder and CEO Peter Smith, the company has more than 20 million users.\nStrategic role\nSmith said Santori will play a strategic role, helping Blockchain meet the demand that exploded last year by scaling up not only the legal and regulatory functions but also corporate development, including acquisitions and partnerships.\n\"In our space, it's so special: go-to-market strategies and acquisition strategies are all reliant on the regulatory and legal side,\" Smith told CoinDesk. \"Having someone come out of that vertical who understands how to run deals is very key.\"\nSantori is uniquely suited for such a role, having been on \"at least one side of every major transaction in the digital currency space over the last four years,\" Smith said.\nThe chief legal officer position is newly created. The president's title previously belonged to Blockchain co-founder Nic Cary, who will maintain an active role as vice chairman, focusing on public affairs and external relations as Santori takes over the policy and expansion duties, a company spokeswoman said.\nCary said in a press release that he will be \"dedicating more of my time [to] building our brand in key regions like India, hiring the brightest talent, and educating more people on the benefits of digital assets.\"\nA long, strange trip\nIn many ways, Santori's career has mirrored the blockchain industry's evolution.\nHe first made a name for himself as a bitcoin-savvy lawyer while working at Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP. In 2013, he became the chairman of regulatory affairs committee at the Bitcoin Foundation and the following year represented the trade group during the New York State Department of Financial Services' BitLicense hearings, watched across the globe.\nIn late 2014, he joined the white-shoe firm of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, and simultaneously was retained as global policy counsel for Blockchain. Santori made partner at Pillsbury two years later.\nThis period coincided with a long bear market for bitcoin. The industry's focus turned to seeking ways corporations and governments could take advantage of the underlying technology without having to touch the currency.\nDuring that era, Santori was a key figure in shaping the state of Delaware's blockchain strategy. He helped to craft legislation that allowed firms incorporated in the First State to record their shares on a distributed ledger.\nAt Cooley, where Santori's been a partner since November 2016, his work has centered around ICOs, which took off like a rocket last year, despite the legal uncertainties surrounding these token sales.\nICO controversies\nSantori tried to bring some clarity to the market last year with the SAFT, or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens.\nIn this structure, a blockchain project raises money exclusively from accredited investors, thereby avoiding securities registration requirements; once a network or product is built, the tokens needed to use it are distributed to the investors, who can resell them to the public.\nThe SAFT idea has been controversial, with some legal scholars fearing it may have the opposite effect from its intent and increase the legal risk for token issues.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators around the globe have begun cracking down on ICOs. And last month, without naming any names, SEC chairman Jay Clayton voiced disapproval of lawyers who have been advising ICOs that resemble securities offerings but don't comply with the securities laws.\nSantori said his move to Blockchain was in the works long before Clayton made those remarks. As for the remarks themselves, he gave a very lawyerly response.\n\"The SEC and the bar are in a learning process about how these things ought to be treated, about where the value is, where the risk is,\" Santori said, adding:\nSantori said his departure from Cooley is bittersweet, since he hasn't finished building the firm's fintech practice, but there aren't enough hours in the day to do that and perform his new duties at Blockchain.\n\"I wish I could do both,\" he said.\nImage via Marco Santori",

    "title": "American Banker Conference: Lines Drawn in Blockchain Debate",
    "summary": "American Banker's Digital Currencies + the Blockchain featured speakers from across the blockchain and finance sectors.",
    "content": "American Banker's second annual digital currencies conference was also its first to put an equal emphasis on the emerging opportunities posed by bitcoin's distributed ledger, the blockchain.\nThe idea that conversation around the technology has altered drastically in the last year was first noted by American Banker editor in chief Marc Hochstein in the event's opening address. The talk proved forward-thinking in its praise for the promise of more expansive and experimental use cases for the blockchain while acknowledging that bitcoin, as its first application, had kickstarted a new wave of innovation.\n\"I'm not going to opine on the price, I'm going to talk about bitcoin, because the idea of it has made me a better editor at American Banker,\" Hochstein said. \"Bitcoin has cast everything that came before it in a new light.\"\nThis tug-of-war between ideologies shaping the technology's development was on display most prominently in the event's early offerings, including a solo speaking slot by Eris Industries co-founder Preston Byrne and a panel featuring Symbiont's Adam Krellenstein, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert and author Tim Swanson.\nThe most interesting talks centered around the still evolving question of whether private blockchains pose a threat to public ledgers like bitcoin, or if they are simply another evolution of the technology specialized for more specific use cases. Still, most panels sought to showcase the technology's place in conversation surrounding larger concepts affecting the financial industry, such as digital identity, data security regulation and recordkeeping.\nRepresenting incumbent banks in this conversation was BNY Mellon managing director Cheryl Gurz, who spoke on a panel meant to highlight future use cases for blockchains. Gurz shed light on the difficulty of mediating a conversation between enthusiastic technologists and sometimes critical economists while trying to uncover whether the technology can offer solutions.\nGruz said:\nStill prominent was conversation about bitcoin as a currency and its price against the dollar, though some panels and speakers touched on its potential use case in areas where financial services have yet to permeate.\nMasters takes the stage\nPerhaps the day's most anticipated session was the opening keynote by Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, the former JP Morgan executive.\nMasters began her talk by addressing the opportunity she saw in distributed ledger technology as well as the personal journey that led her to get involved in its development.\nWhile she said not every \"cool technology\" could be a catalyst for change and that real barriers toward wider adoption would prohibit short-term adoption, Masters was effusive in voicing her belief that the blockchain and distributed ledgers pose a significant opportunity.\nMasters said:\nEchoing comments raised in a recent article penned by executives at technology consulting firm Accenture, Masters also went on to note some of the more specific questions that she feels need to be addressed, such as how the industry should move toward standardization and deal with property titling issues.\nOverall, Masters seemed keen to present a unifying message to the audience, suggesting that the best course of action for the industry is to work to understand the issues faced in the traditional financial industry.\n\"We need to be communicating with the existing legacy of financial infrastructure. It's important that we're respectful of that existing infrastructure, it works today and it has to work,\" she said.\nElsewhere, Masters addressed questions from the crowd, with one attendee posing a hypothetical situation designed to test the limits of permissioned or private ledgers. In this case, Masters was asked how a Venezuelan bank might interact with a permissioned ledger.\nIn response, she issued one of her first public comments on the bitcoin blockchain as a subset of the larger innovation, stating:\nSeparating bitcoin from blockchain\nThis friction surrounding the idea that certain parties in the industry are attempting to separate bitcoin's speculative currency from its digital ledger again created sparks in the panel including Krellenstein; Silbert; Swanson; and New York Law School's Houman Shadab.\nIt was perhaps Swanson and Silbert that served as the polar opposites around which the conversation pivoted, with Silbert emphasizing the expected high future price of bitcoin and Swanson revisiting his published work critiquing the cost efficiency of the bitcoin network when compared to tokenless blockchains.\n\"If you're doing a public network, maybe the only way to do that is a token. But if you're working with known entities on a private network, you can have contractual obligations to secure this network,\" Swanson explained.\nHe went on to relay an anecdote in which he suggested a bank had asked him whether it would be liable if it was involved in a transaction where the validating miner was perhaps operating in a country sanctioned under US law. Swanson suggested that, with the bitcoin network, answers to questions like this still remain too unclear.\nSilbert took the opposite approach attempting to galvanize audience interest in bitcoin by appealing to the speculative value associated with its tokens. His remarks suggested he sees a potential outcome where bitcoin is propelled past alternative blockchains as the use of its network could create new wealth for users.\n\"You didn't buy bitcoin because you were trying solve issues with loans, you bought it out of greedy speculation,\" Silbert said. \"You have a financial incentive to see bitcoin succeed.\"\nIn the midst of these disparate voices was Shadab, who successfully translated the debate into a moderate stance. Shadab argued that blockchains should be seen as transaction platforms that can be designed to offer certain advantages and disadvantages.\nShadab was also agnostic in his view on the bitcoin network, adding:\nElsewhere, Swanson raised eyebrows with his typically confrontational approach to the panel session, suggesting that industry firm ShapeShift was perhaps providing a \"money laundering service\" due to its approach to regulation.\nThe blockchain as software\nPerhaps best known for its colorful public messaging, distributed ledger startup Eris Industries made a splash with a confident presentation by co-founder Preston Byrne.\nByrne offered what may be some of the first public details on the project, revealing it intends to focus on smart contracts that use code to move and manage digital assets on a blockchain, thereby eliminating the need for a token.\nByrne claimed Eris is already working with \"several tier-one banks\", all of whom he says are interested in its centralized approach to the technology. \"Decentralization doesn't work within existing legal paradigms. It causes more commercial problems than it solves,\" he argued.\nInstead, Byrne sought to assert that the true innovation behind bitcoin was that it had created new database efficiencies, effectively merging a database with its log. \"Bitcoin is a very successful piece of software, but it's just software,\" he said.\nByrne also gave insight into the trajectory of the company, which he said built a decentralized Reddit and YouTube in 2014 to prove the data processing capabilities of blockchains.\nStill, he stressed that centralized alternatives to public blockchains like bitcoin could possibly be faster today while solving problems for enterprise clients.\n\"There are no network effects for a database, you're serving a market,\" he said. \"Blockchain technology is better now than it was six years ago. You can get confirmations in a block in two seconds. They work in private segments, not necessarily decentralized ones.\"\nNasdaq\nThe clearest insight into the evolving debate over the technology's development was perhaps provided by the day's final panel, which focused on its impact in financial markets.\nDominick Paniscotti, associate vice president of enterprise architecture at Nasdaq, provided the session's highlights, discussing how bitcoin only \"scratched the surface\" of the potential of bitcoin as a technology.\nHe told the crowd:\nPaniscotti went on to suggest he sees bitcoin as being one of a number of competing blockchains, ones that are better optimized for other needs.\nSymbiont co-founder Mark Smith and Digital Asset Holdings CMO Dan O'Prey also provided insight in the difficulty of delivering technology to institutions such as Nasdaq, speaking about the \"long sales cycle\" and lack of education that is holding back efforts.\n\"When you're walking into the door and explaining what is bitcoin, you have maybe a year, a year and half sales cycle,\" moderator Brendan O'Connor, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, said. \"When you walk in there and you're talking about utilizing bitcoin with this wallet provider, and you start having these kinds of questions, you know they're giving it more serious thought.\"\nSmith went on to talk about how the emphasis on the blockchain as a technology had opened more doors to enterprise institutions, concluding:",

Sites including Blocktrail, Blockr.io and others did not display the transaction, indicating that perhaps the movement didn't actually happen.\nObservers have stated that the issue was due to Blockchain.info's API accepting transactions without validating them, eliciting criticism across social media platforms. The company later acknowledged the issue on Twitter, stating that more details would be forthcoming.\nFunds attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto have not moved. They are unconfirmed by the Bitcoin network and likely spoofed. More details to follow.\n— Blockchain (@blockchain) August 4, 2015\nEarlier today a user took to Reddit claiming to have been responsible for the transaction, stating that he is a researcher from Central Europe who wanted to test the response to sending invalid transactions.\nWhen reached for comment, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith characterized the event as a \"publicity stunt\", arguing that the network would have never validated the transaction.\nHowever, the company has updated its API with a fix that Smith says will prevent a similar situation from developing in the future.\n\"I think we can do a better job of filtering and we currently employ a lot of custom filtering rules so people don’t use our API for malicious purposes like spamming, dust transactions, etc.,\" he told CoinDesk. \"We’ve already implemented some new rules to make this kind of transaction impossible in the future.\"\nAs it stands, it appears Satoshi's coins remain dormant – for now.\nDigital abstract image via Shutterstock",

    "content": "A bitcoin-themed hackathon held at New York University (NYU) over the weekend hinted at the kinds of applications new developers are creating, showcasing everything from new games to shopping research and trading tools.\nThe two-day event, titled HackBit, culminated in eight teams pitching their ideas to a panel of judges. Each team had three minutes of presentation time, followed by two minutes of questions.\nAbout 75 attended the hackathon, mainly university students from the north east and at least one from Ohio. Also participating were established bitcoin companies Blockchain and Chain, with contestants using either company's API.\nPrizes\nA team called To The Moon took first prize in the competition, with their concept of a Space Invaders-style game that awards the tiniest fractions of bitcoins, or satoshis, instead of points. Players can either keep their earnings to spend on game upgrades, or cash out.\nThe game, built on Blockchain's API, demonstrates bitcoin's ability to handle micropayments at scale and, according to participants, it's also fun to play.\nSecond place – and Blockchain's API award – went to BitRec, a receipt tracking system and spending dashboard that gives consumers valuable information on their purchasing habits. Third place went to a bitcoin trading tool called Bitquant.\nChain and Blockchain support\nChain co-founder Adam Ludwin told CoinDesk that his company also handed out a prize for the best use of its API. The winner, Lightcoin (not to be confused with litecoin), combined a hardware hack with innovative use of light and sound to notify bitcoin users when a transaction is made.\nHe said the team at bitcoin infrastructure platform Chain are big fans of both NYU and bitcoin, so it was \"a great match\".\nBlockchain president Peter Smith said the company believed in supporting more developers entering the bitcoin universe, particularly students.\nMost of the students involved were new to bitcoin, staying up all night to complete their projects.\nThe HackBit event was NYU's first bitcoin hackathon, and was held in conjunction with Hacker League, NYU's Entrepreneurial Institute and the NYU Entrepreneurs Network. It was also the first hackathon to be held at the brand new NYU Leslie eLab.\nImages courtesy of Blockchain",

Gox occurred at 01:59:06 UTC, which is 8:59 EST.\nWhen users logged into the bitcoin exchange's website they were experiencing the following error message when trying to buy or sell bitcoins:\nNot long after the suspension in trading activity and subsequent outage, leaders within the digital currency space joined together in a bid to restore confidence in bitcoin and distance themselves from the embattled exchange.\nThe US-based hosted wallet Coinbase published the statement first, which later appeared on other websites connected with the messaging. The post, titled \"Joint Statement Regarding MtGox”, reads:\nThis tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt.Gox was the result of one company’s actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin.\nWe are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age.\nIn order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. As part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following services will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, Circle, and BTC China.\nWe strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. We pledge to lead the way.\nBitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. Acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. It does not appear to any of us that MtGox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.\"\nThe statement also names the following bitcoin industry veterans as supporting this position.\nFred Ehrsam — Co-founder of Coinbase\nJesse Powell — CEO of Kraken\nNejc Kodrič — CEO of Bitstamp.net\nBobby Lee — CEO of BTC China\nNicolas Cary — CEO of Blockchain.info\nJeremy Allaire — CEO of Circle\nThe outage of Mt. Gox and the subsequent joint release of this statement follows unconfirmed reports about the future of Mt. Gox's viability as a bitcoin exchange.\nCoinDesk is monitoring this developing story, and will post updates as they become known.",

That’s a win for us, that’s a win for Blockchain.info, that’s a win for the community at large,\" he said.\nBeginner's fair\nThe Blockchain-branded cards were first introduced at the recent Bitcoin Beginner's Fair.\nThe event was held at the San Francisco coworking space 20Mission.

    "summary": "Hyperledger has launched a Performance and Scalability Working Group to build tools for measuring how blockchains cope with increasing popularity.",
    "content": "How should a blockchain's performance be measured?\nAs businesses begin asking this question in earnest, the open-source, Linux-led Hyperledger project has announced a new Performance and Scalability Working Group (PSWG) aimed at measuring how the various available blockchains will perform as their popularity and usage increases.\nLeading the effort is Mark Wagner, a senior principal software engineer at Red Hat who has 15 years experience in performance and scalability. Red Hat was one of the founding members of Hyperledger, and at the end of 2016, Wagner became the software company’s representative on the project.\nWagner explained one of the expected results of the group's work will be to maintain a matrix of the key performance metrics and corresponding data for different blockchain implementations. The data is planned to help end users better choose the right platform to fit their needs.\nAs Wagner envisions it, the group will eventually develop a suite of downloadable kits anyone can use to test distributed ledger platforms, such as Hyperledger, Corda and Quorum, as well as public blockchains, like bitcoin and ethereum.\nHe told CoinDesk:\nSetting the scope\nWhile often thought of as one and the same, performance and scalability aren't synonymous – performance refers to how long it takes a system to process a request, while scalability relates to a system's ability to handle an increase in workload, such as when new users are added to a system.\nWhy is this important? Because evidence is compelling that scaling cannot be an afterthought – it needs to be a part of the system architecture right from the start.\nBitcoin, for example, has become a poster child for the types of problems that can emerge when a network is not built to scale. Following massive growth, transaction processing times are taking longer and costing more, and the community is divided on how to address the issue (if they believe it's an issue at all).\nWhile it's working with multiple distributed ledger platforms, Hyperledger nonetheless faces similar problems in its attempt to empower a diversity of stakeholders.\nTo measure performance and scalability in a meaningful way, everyone must be working within a common framework, otherwise, it becomes difficult to compare notes.\nWagner concluded:\nSky ladder image via Shutterstock",

Opening remarks will be given by Gelenbe at 10:30 (PST).\nFirst-day speakers will include Carey, Larsen and Shalek, as well as; Patrick Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel; Emmanuel Abiodun, CEO and founder of Cloudhashing.com; and a to-be-announced government representative.\nStartup pitches will be heard from 14:00 to 15:00, and will feature a handpicked list of startups that Gelenbe believes deserve access to an audience of \"the right people\". He said:\nTwo one-hour intervals starting at 12:15 and 13:15 will provide for networking opportunities. Additionally, a cocktail party will be held from 17:45 to 20:00.\nDay two itinerary\nWednesday's events will begin earlier in the day at 9:00 (PST) with a debate on the longevity of bitcoin and continue through 17:30 with closing remarks by Gelenbe.\nNotable speakers contributing to day-two discussions include Nejc Kodric, co-founder and CEO of Bitstamp; Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum and Kryptokit; and Brock Pierce, investor and board member at the Mastercoin Foundation.\nDay two will also feature two one-hour networking intervals.

    "summary": "Blockchain returns to the App Store with a totally rewritten wallet app for users of Apple's iPhone and iPad.",
    "content": "UPDATE (30th July 11:44 BST): Users have reported a bug in the denomination functionality on Blockchain's iOS app whereby orders are being billed in 'bits’ – also known as 'uBTC' – rather than 'BTC'. For example, a user buying an item would click the 'Pay with Bitcoin' link, but their wallet (configured to display in 'bits') would send .0843 bits instead of .0843 BTC. CEO Nic Cary says a fix will be implemented in the app's next update \"imminently\".\nFollowing Apple's controversial removal of iOS bitcoin apps in January, the first of the big-name wallets relaunches on the App Store today.\nBlockchain\n, which already provides hugely popular wallets for both desktop computers and Android devices, has unveiled its new-from-the-ground-up iOS wallet, which it hopes will bring bitcoin to users across the globe.\nPrior to Apple’s removal of all apps offering cryptocurrency transactions in January 2014, Blockchain was the most downloaded bitcoin wallet for iOS devices.\nControversial ban\nBlockchain's announcement will likely come as welcome news for the bitcoin community, which protested loudly at Apple's ban – with some users even shooting their iPhones in an unlikely show of support.\nHowever, for reasons known only to Apple insiders, a new, more open policy was announced at the Worldwide Developer’s Conference in early June, paving the way once more for bitcoin wallets and other apps that transact using cryptocurrencies.\nIn the weeks since then, the App Store has seen the addition of several bitcoin apps, including an unofficial wallet for Coinbase users and Gliph, a messaging service that lets connected users send each other bitcoin. However, Blockchain is the first of the major players to offer wallet services on iOS since early 2014.\nNicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain, told CoinDesk:\nHe added: “Working with Apple has been quick and easy, and we really appreciate their thoughtful guidance – it's a partnership we really value.”\nThe new app\nAs well as exchanging bitcoin between wallets, Blockchain's app also allows iPhone and iPad users to make purchases from the fast-growing number of merchants that accept bitcoin – both online and in physical outlets.\nThat list has this year expanded to include major retailers such as Overstock, DISH, Expedia and, most recently, Dell (for more, see our guide to bitcoin-accepting merchants).\nCary said that Blockchain has rebuilt its wallet app from scratch to improve security, enhance performance, and introduce a new user experience. He explained:\nNew features coming\nCary told CoinDesk that the new wallet for iOS will be available for users to download from the App Store today, adding:\nHe further explained that the return to Apple iOS is “hugely important for bitcoin in general and very exciting for Blockchain”. The release of the app means that the millions of iOS users around the world will now have the opportunity to experience bitcoin first-hand, Cary indicated, adding:\nBlockchain is currently the most popular bitcoin wallet in the world with over 1.9 million users. Its website, Blockchain.info, also hosts bitcoin charts, currency statistics, and a block-chain explorer.\nDisclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of any of the companies mentioned.

    "title": "The Blockchain is a New Model of Governance",
    "summary": "The blockchain provides an alternative governance model to the current system of oligarchic control, argues Nozomi Hayase.",
    "content": "As the Greece debt crisis unfolds and capital controls are forced down the throats of their people, bitcoin has moved back into the mainstream spotlight. With long lines in front of ATM machines reminiscent of the Cyprus bail-in, once again bitcoin appears to offer a safe haven.\nWhile many people focus on bitcoin’s price fluctuations and potential increase in adoption, currency is just the first application of this game-changing technology. The core of the blockchain provides an alternative governance model to the current oligarchic control shown in the harsh austerity forced against the will of the Greek people.\nIn the six years of its existence, public awareness of this technology has grown by leaps and bounds. Now, most who are aware of this groundbreaking innovation know the blockchain is a ledger. Yet, this ledger is not simply for accounting monetary transactions.\nAt its core, it is a platform that allows people to come to agreement on virtually anything without intermediaries. It provides a foundation to make social contracts based on the principle of consensus. Foremost, it enables a larger function of accounting; performing checks and balance on the self interests and the corruptible tendencies that exist in society.\nIn his white paper published in 2008, anonymous creator of this technology Satoshi Nakamoto noted it was invented as a solution to the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model. Roger Ver, aka 'Bitcoin Jesus', an angel investor in bitcoin startups, recently remarked on the Greek financial crisis, pointing out the fallible nature of the existing forms of governance that create one-way contracts:\nGovernments don't have the consent of the governed. They have forcible control of the governed, with the \"consent\" of a third party. #grexit\n— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) July 14, 2015\nBitcoin self-regulates through algorithm, eliminating counter-party risk and the need for traditional legal and regulatory tools that have shown to be ineffective in events such as HSBC money laundering and the giant banking industry’s currency printing and market rigging. The core of this invention is distributed trust and is enabled through a mechanism called proof of work.\nProof of work\nIn his presentation Consensus Algorithms, Blockchain Technology and Bitcoin, security expert and author Andreas Antonopoulos described how proof of work is composed of specific cryptographic hash functions and sets of game theoretical equilibrium systems that dynamically adjust and create economics of scale.\nProof of work plays a vital role in securing the system. Adam Back, inventor of Hashcash, which contributed to the fundamentals of bitcoin, noted how it “constructs a computational irrevocability from proof-of-work and consensus”.\nThis means no one can undo the work one has done. No one can fake the work or go around it. Miners at the heart of the bitcoin ecosystem have to perform hash operations by using precious resources and if they play by the rules they receive value, and if not, they lose value. In other words, all are held directly accountable by being required to spend their resources and show the presentation of their work.\nThis makes the blockchain bulletproof and resistant to manipulation. It also guards against the hyperinflation created as a result of government intervention through measures such as quantitative easing. When looked at as a larger governance model, this accounts for potential selfish attempts that try to benefit from the good will of people.\nGenius of economic incentive\nWhat gives the impulse for this self-organizing system and, most of all, where does this force of accountability come from? There is no central planner in bitcoin. In a sense, Satoshi’s anonymity embodies the technology’s essence. There are effectively no fingerprints on this technology. At the center of this mathematical invention is a vital economic incentive that spontaneously organizes miners to make the ledger decentralized and immutable.\nThis incentive structure manifested in its built-in digital scarcity is an underlying current behind the bitcoin network. This was built with a realistic and honest assessment of man’s self-interests.\nHistory is filled with evidence of what happens when we fail to account for our selfish tendencies within. Dark memories of atomic bombs, slavery, Holocaust and genocide remind us of the cruel and violent parts inherent in humanity and the mass destruction we are capable of committing.\n[post-quote]\nWhen self-interests are not acknowledged, they quickly escape consciousness. Lower aspects of our humanity that are denied can then easily gain the upper hand. They become a kind of insatiable hunger that drives people to the pursuit of power, creating fraudulent systems where anti-social forces attack networks, take over economies and undermine the sovereignty and will of the people.\nThrough accounting for selfish motives and greed and using rewards to encourage good behavior in a transparent open network, the blockchain creates incentive for participants to work honestly, where rules are applied to all equally.\nThis way, the system can more effectively mitigate the risk of humanity’s destructive potential.\nDistributed accountability\nThe bitcoin network fosters a true consent of the governed through voluntary participation and enables self-regulation taken up by each choosing to abide by the rule of consensus.\nWhat emerges in this innovation is a new form of social accountability. Unlike traditional representative models of governance, where systems of checks and balance are exercised through third parties, under bitcoin’s consensus model, accountability is distributed directly and exercised by all in the network.\nThis removes single points of failure and provides far better security than existing systems. With the blockchain's transparency, those who prefer profit without work will have no place to run and no place to hide.\nThere are already creative initiatives to strengthen political accountability through the use of this technology. London mayoral candidate George Galloway is calling for the city to adopt blockchain-based accounting in order to provide full transparency for the public of the city’s financial activities.\nAlong with the host of the RT’s financial report Max Keiser, Galloway created The Mayor's Chain Project that would put the city’s annual budget on a blockchain to foster collective auditing by citizens.\nEnshrined in the bitcoin protocol is a blueprint for decentralized forms of governance. This is a real invention and can’t be uninvented. As the global crisis of legitimacy deepens, austerity will continue, with insolvent banks bailing themselves out and hedge funds getting away with cooking the books.\nBitcoin might not be able to save Greece in this moment, but its core technology offers tools for those who want to innovate a truly viable alternative to the centralized institutions of mandated trust and move into a society based on networks of distributed democracy.\nNetwork image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Blockchain Addresses Security Controversy: 'We Need to Do Better'",
    "summary": "Executives from Coinbase and Blockchain got into an online sparring match recently, in a debate that was about more than security.",
    "content": "It has been a terrible couple of weeks for bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.\nFirst, the firm’s product lead got into an online spat with a Coinbase engineer on Reddit. Then, Blockchain's wallet was pulled from Bitcoin.org, an informational website managed by bitcoin core developers and community members, for poor security.\nThe company found itself publicly promising to reimburse customers after a random number generator flaw that led to hundreds of addresses being compromised. Further, unsubstantiated online reports suggested that bitcoins had been stolen as a result of the issue.\nSo, what went wrong, and what’s going to happen next?\nLet’s take the most recent issue first. The firm was forced to make a security disclosure on its blog and on Reddit, admitting that a development error had led to a problem with the generation of private keys. Private keys (effectively the private addresses used to hold bitcoin) were generated with a low degree of entropy, making them easy for attackers to retrieve.\nOnline blowback\nBlockchain offered to reimburse all customers for lost funds, but the online blowback was still huge, with commenters accusing the company of bad development work and managerial problems.\nCommenters on Bitcoin Talk criticised Blockchain for several things, including letting developers push code to a production environment.\nOne Reddit commentator said:\n“I don’t think that’s accurate to say that this is a real criticism on Reddit,” Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary told CoinDesk, about accusations of poor development processes.\nHe added:\n\"We have built a huge amount of software,\" he continued. \"We have released safely all the time, we have quality assurance leads. We have a security team. The real message to the community is that we are going to get better. We know we need to do a better job. At the same time, we have the humility to do what's right and take care of our users when there are issues.\"\nCore bitcoin developer Peter Todd also criticised the company for only having a manual testing repository in its GitHub repository, rather than a fully automated test suite.\nBlockchain’s senior executives did not offer a formal response to Todd’s tweet. Neither did they confirm that there was an automated test suite in the company, discuss their development process or comment about the $30.5m Series A funding deal Blockchain completed in October.\nRedditors had criticised the firm for failing to tighten security issues with the money. Sources close to the company privately pointed out that it takes time for a freshly funded company to use that money and make the necessary internal changes.\nThe Bitcoin.org delisting\nAll of this happened just days after the organisers of Bitcoin.org took Blockchain off the list of wallets that it provides for bitcoin users, with commenters suggesting that \"it should be revisited with reasonable criteria at least as demanding as other wallets\".\nIn the discussion within the GitHub pull request concerning the wallet’s listing on Bitcoin.org, site maintainer Saïvann Carignan highlighted several factors. The first was bugs and losses, of which there have been several, he said.\nThe second was backup and password security. \"[Blockchain] hasn't adopted security features which are slowly becoming standard in other wallets (e.g. BIP32, random passphrases, backup on setup, rotating addresses, 2FA by default),” he said.\nHe also criticised the company for not being transparent enough, and not resetting the app’s source code, adding:\nBen Reeves, Blockchain’s CTO, posted a response in that GitHub discussion addressing the complaints and promising several changes. This was praised by the other participants, on the basis that the initial criticisms concerned the track record of the Blockchain service. So, the consensus remained to delist the wallet for at least 60 days, and to let Blockchain resubmit it after that.\nCarignan acknowledged complaints that there was no set policy for listing or delisting wallets from Bitcoin.org, and opened another discussion to develop a standard process.\n\"We are eager to resubmit there. We respect their decision, but ultimately we have made a lengthy defense for our position. We are still the only open-source company,\" said Cary, who added that the company is making changes to its software, and that people should expect \"exciting things coming to market in 2015\".\nA wider FinTech problem\nBlockchain has made its mistakes, but Emin Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University and an expert in bitcoin security issues, warned against a witch hunt.\nHe said:\nThese security issues are a sign of a wider problem in the cryptocurrency space, warned Sirer.\n\"There is no room for the smallest screwup, and we’re finding out that standard practices that are normal in Silicon Valley are unacceptable in the bitcoin world because there’s so much at stake,\" he said, arguing that the rate of security failures is high across the bitcoin industry.\nOnline spat\nCary also called the timing for this whole affair \"suboptimal\". That seems accurate, given an online spat that broke out between Coinbase and Blockchain executives earlier this month over bitcoin wallet security, in which Blockchain staff criticised Coinbase’s operating model.\nIt all started with a Reddit post by Charlie Lee, the creator of litecoin, who took a job at Coinbase 18 months ago. Lee, now engineer manager at the company, wanted to set the record straight about security at the centralised wallet service.\nLee described what the service has done for the security of its users. Among those he listed were default requests for two-factor authentication (using something you have, such as a phone, in addition to something you know, like a password) if making transactions above $100. The service also included a bitcoin vault for its users, and stores 97% of its own coins in cold storage, said Lee (CoinDesk has covered some of Coinbase’s security before).\nAll this information is part of the public record. The interesting part came in one part of Lee’s post, in which he compared CoinBase’s security to that of Blockchain. One part of the post (later removed) read:\nThis led to an angry riposte by Keonne Rodriguez, product lead at Blockchain, who criticised Lee for chasing his own agenda, and likened him to “a shady lawyer chasing an ambulance”.\nA serious approach\nName calling and criticising doesn’t help anyone, suggested Michael Perklin president of Bitcoinsultants, and a specialist in bitcoin security. Perklin, also a director at the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, has a background in security within other industries.\n“I enjoy accurate discussions based on the merits of the argument,” concluded Perklin. “But whenever anyone throws mud at someone else, they have to get themselves dirty first.“\nThose comments all occurred before Blockchain’s latest security debacle. What does Cary have to say about it now? He is still eager to draw distinctions between the two models.\nCary said:\nCary said that the company was eager to actively engage and listen. “We take all of these things super-seriously. We are here for the long term,” he concluded.\nBusinessman balancing image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Credit Unions Turn to Blockchain Amid Increasing Competition",
    "summary": "The credit union industry's distributed ledger initiative has sparked the interest of CUSOs, a group that has typically not collaborated much.",
    "content": "A less-discussed type of financial entity, the credit union service organization (CUSO), has emerged as an unlikely – but significant – player in the industry’s CU Ledger blockchain initiative.\nIn fact, to say that the involvement of CUSOs in broader credit union collaborations on blockchain has been a surprise wouldn’t shock may long-time industry observers.\nPart of the trend is is simply pure business. With the number of credit unions in the US declining by about 250 institutions per year, this means CUSOs are competing for a ever-smaller piece of the pie.\nBut the advent of distributed ledger technology has brought several CUSOs together with more than 50 credit unions on the CU Ledger initiative, a development whose significance isn’t lost on industry veterans.\nRobert Hackney, president of Card Services for Credit Unions (CSCU), an organization with around 2,000 credit union members, notes that these steps represent a “first” for his group and many of its peers.\nHackney told CoinDesk:\nCUSOs are entities owned by federally chartered and insured credit unions that focus on a core competency, such as payment card processing services or business loan originations. Because credit unions tend to be smaller in size, CUSOs serve as a way for a group of these institutions to pool their resources to provide better, cheaper and new services to their members.\nSo while credit unions themselves don’t shy away from collaboration, CUSOs haven’t seen a reason to work together.\nWhile blockchains have been lauded for their combination of cryptography, time-stamped accounting and data management, for permissioned ledgers to really see their full potential, Hackney acknowledges that competing entities will need to drop some old customs.\n“It’s technology that we all may be able to use. That’s why we’re working together,” Hackney said.\nThe involvement of CUSOs in the industry is also a sign of its shift from possible applications for retail payments to the edges of financial systems. The CU Ledger initiative, for example, is focusing on utilizing smart contracts and finding a solution for user-centric digital identity.\nWhy identity?\nWith it’s user-focused mentality, self-sovereign identity fits well into the credit union’s narrative.\nDeveloping “user-centric identity could solve a lot of problems in banking,” said Dean Young, senior vice president of industry engagement at Payment Services for Credit Unions (PSCU), another CUSO that’s a part of the CU Ledger project.\nThe main problem? Fraud.\n“Imagine a world where … there’s 100% certainty that someone making a transaction is who they are,” said Young.\nA sleeker identity system could also be helpful as it relates to the decreasing number of credit unions. Many times, credit unions merge or get acquired by other credit unions because it allows them to scale while also making revenue within a cumbersome regulatory environment, said Hackney.\nBecause of that, “it’s not uncommon for a credit union to have its credit portfolio with us (CSCU) and its debit portfolio with PSCU,” he said. “So if there are ways to authenticate through different portfolios and different providers that would be very beneficial in this environment.”\nDestiny control\nIn that view, the credit unions and their service providers stand to potentially benefit by using the technology. But what about the members themselves?\nAccording to Young, the answer lies in the portability of a single digital ID, which could eliminate the need for managing hundreds of username and password pairs.\nThat, and the ability to exert far greater control over that information.\nThat kind of individual control is one of the reasons the credit union industry decided to build it’s own ledger system, working on an identity proof of concept with Evernym, a startup based in Salt Lake City.\n“The ability for the credit union movement to create a ledger and control its own destiny is more appealing than some avenues we looked at,” Young said.\nLooking ahead\nThe traditional banking industry’s more competitive nature might be one reason no commercial blockchain product has launched in the financial services space as of yet. But the Cu Ledger group is working on a short timeline for implementation.\nThe CU Ledger effort plans on having a proof-of-concept up and running by the first quarter or early second quarter of next year, according to Young.\nThe effort is fueled by fees paid by those taking part in the project. To be a part of CU Ledger, the founders asked for a minimum investment of $10,000 per participant. But since that could be a challenge for some smaller credit unions, the terms were flexible, said Young.\n“Collaboration is foundational in this industry, Young said. “This is not just a PSCU commercial solution. We don’t believe in a ‘build it and they will come’ philosophy but more of a philosophy of ‘build it together and then they’re already here.’”\nThe presence of CUSOs such as CSCU and PSCU, along with credit union participants and their members, should jumpstart adoption when the time comes. Since the two CUSOs work with more than half of all credit unions in the US, the kind of integration needed largely exists as-is.\nPieces of a puzzle image via Shutterstock",

    "title": "Ten People You Meet in Bitcoin",
    "summary": "It's not just celebrities and high-flyers, but the everyday people you meet in bitcoin who make the scene tick.",
    "content": "Last month, over 600 people congregated in Las Vegas for the Inside Bitcoins conference, including yours truly. The critical mass of bitcoin pioneers and thought leaders was stunning, and I wrote about the top ten movers and shakers I had the chance to meet in person.\nThis past weekend, nearly twice as many people attended the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, and the attendees continued to wow me with their enthusiasm, creativity, and raw intelligence.\nAs I flew back to Boston, I realized that the conference’s palpable energy stemmed just as much from the quality of the 'average' attendees as it did from the high-profile presenters and exhibitors.\nForget celebrities; let's talk about ten who represent the 'average' people you will meet in bitcoin.\nEarly adopters\nI arrive in Miami for the pre-conference cocktail party on Friday night, and one of the first people I meet is Charlie. He's 42, but he looks 30, and is as easy-going as they come. We share a few stories before the invariable question of \"How long have you been in bitcoin?\" pops up, and he nonchalantly says that he purchased \"a bunch\" when bitcoin traded for $4.50.\nToday, he considers himself retired, travels the world and doesn't worry about a whole heck of a lot.\nIncredibly, Charlie is not unique in this crowd. Dozens of paper and actual millionaires, hackers, entrepreneurs, legal experts, miners and journalists mingle at the roof deck party in the Clevelander Hotel in Miami Beach this first night.\nIt is an eclectic mix of individuals with vastly different backgrounds and interests, but a common passion for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\nEntrepreneurs and hackers\nThere's David, an entrepreneur who loves \"beekeeping as much as bitcoin.\" He and his seven year old son have made all-natural honey since 2011, which they only sell in exchange for bitcoin. In fact, the whole operation is completely cashless (aside from taxes), as David's packager, web-designer and sugar suppliers are all paid in bitcoin.\nThen there's Gary, a man determined to sell his '93 Mercedes Benz 300 CE Convertible at the conference in order to demonstrate how easy, inexpensive and trustless bitcoin transactions can be. I will see him again the very next day grinning from ear-to-ear in front of the conference hall having just successfully auctioned the car for 9.25 BTC.\nFinally, there's Kevin, a baby-faced engineer interning for wallet service provider Blockchain. He's won several hacking competitions related to cyber-security and has been thinking about applying for an NSA scholarship to help defray the costs of Penn State, but he's here now because he knows that he too might strike digital gold if he stays in the industry.\nSome needed diversity\nI am also pleasantly surprised to see that the community is evolving beyond the \"white males club\" many complain about. Although the first person that most attendees see on Friday is a stunning blonde model clad in little more than gold body paint (which certainly annoys some), the other females at the conference aren’t just wives and girlfriends.\nThe women on the BitPay team are sharp and counter (or let's be honest, correct) the technical criticisms I have of their product.\nRena, the co-founder of New York's MintCombine incubator, talks about bitcoin's likely regulatory path and her motivation for incubating young bitcoin enterprises. And Beth, a former NASA engineer and current Virgin Galactic astronaut trainer who helped assemble the international space station, tells me about her mining rig (\"just a few Jupiters\").\nEven during conversations with actual 'plus-ones' like one Emily, it's still refreshing to hear someone tease her \"good ole boy\" finance colleagues for not understanding bitcoin and investing in the currency as aggressively as she has.\nOur gold-painted greeter, Maili, also becomes a bitcoin convert on Friday night. When one person suggests she try collecting tips in bitcoin, she tells him she will put a QR code on her professional website.\nMy experience tells me that would be smart. The bitcoin community is as generous as it is passionate.\nBenevolence\nWhen I made the last minute decision to attend the conference, I foolishly underestimated how crowded Miami Beach would be during mid-January and struggled to find a hotel room.\n[post-quote]\nYet after one blast email and fifteen minutes, I had a host. Jeffrey, a fellow writer, conference presenter, and entrepreneur (his Liberty.me IndieGogo campaign recently eclipsed the $100k mark) splits his hotel room with me for two nights.\nWe meet for the first time when I knock on his door.\nAt another point in the conference, I ask Tim, the Bitcoin Seattle meetup organizer, for a stick of gum and extend my hand. Instead of the gum, he hands me a bitcoin-engraved silver coin.\nWhen I explain that I had only meant to ask for some gum, he shrugs and says, \"That's ok. I like your writing. Consider it a tip.\"\nDriving the future\nFor every Jeremy Allaire, Brian Armstrong and Barry Silbert, there are ten equally passionate people you don't know like Tim, Rena and David who make the industry so vibrant and exciting. And you may only meet them at large conferences like this one.\nThey are having so much fun tackling some of the biggest challenges in bitcoin, it is hard to see them abandoning the movement anytime soon. Every single one of them understands how risky bitcoin is, but they see today's risks as tomorrow's opportunities.\nThey are certain that the community will persevere through any hiccups and produce new crops of Allaires, Armstrongs and Silberts. They just aren't worried about a whole heck of a lot.\nRyan Galt is a blogger, entrepreneur and freelance opinion writer for CoinDesk. His opinions do not necessarily reflect CoinDesk's.

    "summary": "The wallet focuses on mobile security as well as privacy protection for bitcoin but doesn't let you send BTC.",
    "content": "Apple has approved a bitcoin wallet app for the iPhone and iPad, though not without a key restriction: App users will not be able to send BTC.\nbitWallet\n, made by a company called Sollico, is now available in the Apple App Store. The listing is notable given the struggles of high-profile bitcoin wallet providers such as Coinbase and Blockchain to have their apps remain in the store. Both companies saw their apps removed in events that outraged the wider bitcoin community.\nA company representative from Sollico says it submitted the wallet to Apple under the notion that it might be approved if sending capabilities were prohibited:\nThe prescence of bitWallet's app suggests that Apple may be willing to allow bitcoin apps that cannot send or receive bitcoins directly. The app focuses on mobile security as well as privacy protection for bitcoin storage.\nAs it stands, bitWallet is a lone App Store option available on iOS for wallets.\nbitWallet Features\nAlthough the lack of a send function is an inconvenience, users can transfer funds via other methods with a wallet's private key.\nAccording the Sollico:\nBitWallet goes to lengths to ensure bitcoin wallet privacy on the iPhone. The app guards against the threat of memory scraping by clearing all sensitive information when the app is running in the background. Private keys remain encrypted.\nbitWallet's Watchlist feature allows users to track blockchain address transactions. The wallet uses Blockchain.info to retrieve data, and the company says it plans to bring on other sources of ledger information in the future for redundancy purposes.\nAnother company called Pheeva is planning to distribute a fully functional as a workaround to Apple's bitcoin ban. A members-only private distribution method, cooperatives are commonly used in organizations to distribute internal company-only iOS app.\nThe bitWallet developers say that the approval process took Apple about three weeks, which is longer than usual.\nApple's stance on bitcoin\nApple has taken a harsh stance against bitcoin apps since last December. That's when when the company required messaging app Gliph to remove its bitcoin \"attachment\" sending feature. The Cupertino company most recently asked e-commerce app Fancy to remove bitcoin payments from its iOS app.\nPopular wallet Coinbase had its iOS app pulled last November.\nLikewise, in February, Apple removed the Blockchain.info iOS wallet from the App Store. This caused consternation among some users, with one particularly angry Blockchain.info mobile wallet user shooting his iPhone, destroying it.\nDespite Apple's behavior towards bitcoin, bitWallet's developers remain optimistic. They say that the plan is to submit another version of the app with sending functionality soon.\nSollico says that it plans to be very clear about the functions of its wallet when it submits future versions of bitWallet to Apple.\n\"Once again, we will be totally upfront with Apple about what the app can and cannot do,\" the company added.\nIt remains unclear when or if Apple will ever allow bitcoin transfers to flow freely from within iOS apps.",

    "summary": "The bitcoin community mocks the FBI, sending messages to the address used for seizing Silk Road's funds.",
    "content": "The bitcoin community has been having some fun with the FBI, after it discovered the bitcoin address that the agency has been using to transfer Silk Road bitcoins to its own wallet. Pranksters have been sending tiny transactions to the address, giving them a chance to attach personal messages to the feds.\nThe FBI had already seized 26,000 bitcoins that had been held in escrow for Silk Road customers. It registered a bitcoin address using blockchain.info, which has a feature enabling people to attach notes if they send bitcoins using its wallet.\nAmong advertisements for bitcoin exchanges, pleas for charity, and sideways references to the X-Files, was one wag who seemed intent on Rickrolling the FBI. Repeatedly.\nOthers were more serious. “What we’re doing isn’t about scoring drugs or ‘sticking it to the man.’ It’s about standing up for our rights as human beings and refusing to submit when we’ve done no wrong,” said one commenter.\nOthers are already looking ahead, beyond Silk Road.\n“They took down the site via conventional detective methods, but in the end, it doesn't really matter,” said Roger Ver, bitcoin advocate and founder of Memory Dealers, in an email to CoinDesk. “Here is an example of why.” He then posted a picture of the Black Market Reloaded site, which is a replacement for Silk Road.\nBlack Market was one of the sites listed in a note sent with a bitcoin transaction to the FBI’s blockchain.info address. That sender also posted the Tor link to another, called Sheep Marketplace.\nOthers are proposing alternatives that move entirely outside the Silk Road system, in which a central arbiter held bitcoins in escrow, releasing them when both parties to a transaction were satisfied.\nInstead, the proposal suggested using bitcoin transaction scripts to find an ad hoc third-party who would mediate a transaction. Their vote would be needed to finalize a transaction and release coins from a buyer to a seller on the network.\n“Everyone can be an arbitrator and they get chosen based on their reputation,” (s)he said, proposing a system like Namecoin to maintain identities and reputation information. That system could also use a community-run, decentralized social network such as Diaspora, in which multiple users could host their own nodes, all operating an instance of a black market marketplace.\nPresumably, this would have to run over anonymous browsing networks such as Tor to avoid people running the networks being picked up by the authorities – although we're not entirely sure what such people would be charged with, if they were not handling funds.\nBut such a site would be a future problem for the Agency, which has bigger issues on its hands right how, as it tries to access a further 600,000 bitcoins. The 26,000 coins it already accessed were held by Silk Road, but the other funds were held separately by Ulbricht, and are worth around $80m at today’s prices. An FBI representative told Forbes that the private keys to these wallets are encrypted.\nFeatured image: Flickr",

    "content": "Notorious nonprofit journalistic organization WikiLeaks revealed via Twitter on 24th January that the majority of its public funding now comes through bitcoin and litecoin donations.\nThe tweet included a link to its official donation page, which lists major mainstream channels like American Express, MasterCard and PayPal. The organisation also accepts traditional bank transfers and Visa as other payment options.\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 24, 2014\nThe message included WikiLeaks' official Blockchain.info address, which has received 3,855 BTC to date from more than 2,200 transactions.\nA detailed look at WikiLeaks' payment history shows a spike in support this December when it received 56 BTC (46,444.68 USD).\nBitcoin and WikiLeaks: a history of support\nThe announcement demonstrates that bitcoin supporters continue to play a key role in supporting the whistleblower organisation, famous for its release of almost 400,000 documents related to US involvement and actions in the Iraq War.\nThis past June, WikiLeaks raised 7.18 BTC to support exiled former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked details of US government surveillance programs that caused widespread public outrage and eventually spawned contentious reform in the US.\nSnowden has been living in asylum in Russia after the country granted him a one-year stay to delay his potential incarceration for the leaks in the US. The 30-year-old North Carolina native has deepened his relationship with WikiLeaks founder Assange in recent weeks, with Assange informing the press of Snowden's actions and commenting on his treatment in interviews.\nPayment security\nOne reason virtual currency has become the preferred payment method of WikiLeaks is that it allows the organisation to circumvent traditional payment process, such as Bank of America, MasterCard, PayPal and Visa, all of which moved to block its donations in 2010, the height of its controversy.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk in June, Tuur Demeester, formerly of MacroTrends, elaborated on the relationship between the news agency and virtual currencies:\nDemeester went on to suggest that the high level of donations showed that free speech and privacy were two rights shared by bitcoin users and WikiLeaks.\nAs of press time, WikiLeaks received eight bitcoin donations for a total of 15.17 BTC (12,579 USD) on 24th January.\nImage Credit: acidpolly / Flickr",

Back in October, the lucky user who created the 500,000th wallet was rewarded with 10 BTC, so the stakes are high.\nBlockchain acknowledged that reaching the one million mark is a major accomplishment for any service, especially in the bitcoin space. A company spokesman said:\nBlockchain started 2013 with around 100,000 users. By contrast, 2014 is kicking off with more than a million users.\nThe company said: “The growth seen over the past year has happened during a pivotal time for bitcoin. Blockchain plans to build this milestone into an outreach opportunity for bitcoin newbies and enthusiasts.”\nBlockchain.info added that its leadership role in the bitcoin economy is “only just beginning,” so we can expect a lot more over the next few months.\nIt is also keen to emphasise that it is nearly a “100% bitcoin” business, as it pays its employees and most of its services in bitcoin. It also closes its business deals in bitcoins, including the recent acquisition of ZeroBlock, the most popular iOS/Android app for bitcoin.\nIf, by chance, you did open a Blockchain account over the last few hours, it might be a good idea to check whether you were the lucky one-millionth user.",

    "content": "A new service is launching its invite-only beta this week with the promise of delivering the \"gold standard\" for bitcoin data.\nChallenger Deep\nis a platform aiming to make the bitcoin ecosystem easy to navigate for non-technical users, including investors, traders and consumers.\nEntrepreneur and ad-tech veteran Pascal Gauthier, who is self-funding Challenger Deep with around $2m, said he saw a gap in the market for a one-stop service:\n\"Whether your job is bitcoin, advertising [or] e-commerce, every market needs an independent source for data,\" he added.\nThe scalable platform offers both real-time and historic data on various aspects of bitcoin, including blockchain and market data. The data is sourced from the blockchain, alongside open and private APIs. \"We are getting closer to a lot of bitcoin companies to extract more data from them,\" Gauthier added.\nIn the future, the seven-person team hopes to release more advanced features, including a bitcoin 'fear index' that will predict price direction and a way to compare features of different wallets and exchanges. A database of bitcoin companies is also in the works.\nFollowing its beta, the first public version of Challenger Deep is due for release later this September. It will operate as a 'freemium' model, where basic access to its platform and APIs is free but users can opt to pay for add-on services or to avoid adverts.\nThe price tiers will be decided following the results of the beta, Gauthier said. Interested users can register for the beta starting today, with the first access codes being sent Tuesday next week.\nCompetition\nChallenger Deep faces competition from a host of bitcoin data firms. Blockchain, the widely-cited source of bitcoin network data, is backed by $30.5m in VC funding.\nMeanwhile, products such as Elliptic's 'Bitcoin Big Bang' and Chainalysis are looking to capture the compliance market with tailored blockchain tracking and labelling features.\nGauthier maintains his service will stand out as the only one \"with an open access to all our data resources\". Additionally, it will be built to scale.\nWhile the market for these kinds of services is still small, Challenger Deep is Gauthier's bet that it could grow and grow, and his startup with it.\n\"Cryptocurrency business will be revolutionary and will grow fast in the next few years. What seems to be a small niche market today is potentially enormous in the future. So yes, we believe that, in time, the market for bitcoin-specific data will be here,\" he concluded.\nCharts image via Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Sweden-based bitcoin brokerage Safello has launched a new social-inspired wallet service.",
    "content": "Safello is now allowing users to request invitations to its newly launched bitcoin wallet service.\nFor the release, the Sweden-based bitcoin services company will leverage Blockchain's API, though its wallet service will build upon Blockchain's basic offering, adding an additional social layer that will allow users to easily search for other users with whom they've previously transacted.\nThe news was released during a panel session at Sthlm Tech Fest, a Sweden-based conference featuring top talent from the payments world such as Stripe and iZettle alongside bitcoin companies such as Safello, Blockchain and KnCMiner.\nSafello chose to take a decidedly under-the-radar approach to the release, opting against issuing a formal press release. However, news of the new service quickly found its way to Reddit, an event that CEO Frank Schuil cited as evidence of the demand for the service.\nSchuil told CoinDesk that users may need to be patient, as not all requests to access the service will be immediately approach. He said:\nEmphasizing ease of use\nSafello framed its wallet service as one that aims to eliminate some of the more common pain points associated with bitcoin wallets, branding it as \"so easy that even your mom could use it\". Notably, Safello's wallet will incorporate features common to digital address books, allowing users to easily search for friends.\nAll transactions can be viewed in a timeline and if verified accounts are being used, bitcoin addresses will be replaced by user names, photos and comments. The end result is Safello's wallet history being visualized more in the style of the social timelines that Facebook and Twitter users have grown accustomed to.\nThe Safello wallet also uses verified accounts to bolster security, a feature that allows users to confirm that the addresses to which they send bitcoin are the intended recipients.\nAdditionally, Safello does not store any private keys at all, as the wallet uses Blockchain’s API to create wallets.\nSafello gains market momentum\nThe announcement was made at roughly 11:10 BST during a lunch panel session at the conference.\nSpeakers for the panel included Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary and KnCMiner co-founder Sam Cole, whose bitcoin mining company raised $14m in Series A funding on 4th September.\nThe panel also include Erik Olofsson of Creandum, the Sweden-based venture capital firm that lead KnCMiner's most recent funding round, and was moderated by 500 Startups venture partner Sean Percival.\nThe inclusion at the conference is the latest milestone for Safello, which launched in April to become the \"Coinbase of Europe\". That announcement was proceeded by the company's $600,000 funding round in February, a round led by Blockchain's Nicolas Cary and bitcoin luminaries Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver.\nImages via Safello and Shutterstock",

    "title": "Could the Bitcoin Lightning Network Solve Blockchain Scalability?",
    "summary": "Could a decentralised system where off-blockchain bitcoin transactions are sent over a network of micropayment channels solve blockchain scalability?",
    "content": "The blockchain's increasing size continues to raise concerns about its ability to accommodate transaction growth.\nBut, could a decentralised system where transactions are sent over a network of off-blockchain micropayment channels solve the ledger's scalability problems?\nJoseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, the developers behind the Bitcoin Lightning Network, think so.\nAlthough still in its nascent stage, the Lightning Network – based on a recent white paper – aims to solve the scalability issue by implementing hashed timelock contracts between users.\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network came to life in 2013, when Poon, \"like many before him\", he says, had the idea for hub and spoke payment channels. Dryja came on board soon after, making scripting and transactions more compact.\nPoon told CoinDesk:\n\"We hope to help solve bitcoin scalability and instant transactions, enabling bitcoin to encompass all transactions – even many thousands of micropayments per person,\" he concluded.\nInitial challenges included the realisation that the solution required the implementation of a soft-fork; a change to the bitcoin protocol that serves to invalidate pervious blocks and transactions, although the old nodes still recognise the new blocks as valid.\nThe scalability problem\nFull bitcoin nodes are required to store a record of every single transaction that takes place, and as this record grows, that in turn is decreasing the amount of people willing to pay for the escalating costs of running nodes.\nFor this reason, the developers believe that bitcoin's open ledger does not suffice as a lone payment platform.\nTo put this into perspective, according to the white paper, the Visa payment network is believed to complete 45,000 transactions per second during a standard holiday period. This increases to hundreds of millions on an average business day.\nBitcoin currently supports approximately seven transactions per second, and is limited to one megabyte of block space. To achieve more than 45,000 transactions per second, Poon and Dryja say that bitcoin transactions must be conducted off the blockchain itself.\nThe white paper notes:\nIt continues: \"It is desirable for two individuals to net out their relationship at a later date, rather than detailing every transaction on the blockchain. This can be achieved by using timelocks as a component to global consensus.\"\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network\nWhile this may sound complicated, essentially it works like this – If all bitcoin transactions are being discussed in an open forum, its public ledger, the lightning network allows parties to enter into a closed room for a period of time, conduct transactions during that period, and at the end of the agreed time, broadcast these transactions to the network.\nThe white paper states:\nSupporters of the proposal suggest this is an improvement over the current transaction systems employed by bitcoin services companies like Coinbase, where transactions are conducted off-blockchain, or away from the network.\nThey argue that in such scenarios, bitcoins on the network are controlled by Coinbase to avoid the complications of settling small transactions in real-time on the network. Lightning, they argue, presents an alternative where users are in control of funds.\nThe Lightning Network is not the only project seeking for a sustainable solution to micropayments, however.\nBlockCypher recently proposed a solution by which it plans to \"calculate miners' fees opportunistically\" to ensure microtransactions are added to the blockchain. The system is already in use by Zapchain, the bitcoin-focused social network that recently launched a dedicated micropayments channel.\nDecrementing timelocks\nA hash-time locked contract is first opened by creating a transaction output which only the final recipient can redeem.\nThe recipient will generate random data 'R', and then hash 'R' using hash(R) to produce 'H'. This information is passed on directly from the receiver to the sender of the funds, along with the recipient's bitcoin address.\nThe sender then routes the payment to the receiver. Once the receiver has received an updated transaction in a micropayment channel, the recipient may elect to redeem the transaction by disclosing 'R', pulling the funds form the sender.\nThe purpose of the hash locked contract is to require message 'R' to be disclosed in order for the transaction to be broadcast on the blockchain before a certain date.\nHowever, if Dave does not produce 'R' for Carol within the established time limit, then Carol will be able to close the hash locked time contract.\nThe receiver will never disclose 'R' unless they are certain that they will receive payment from one of the channel's counterparties. If a party disconnects the channel, the counterparty will be responsible for broadcasting the current commitment transaction state on the blockchain.\nAssociated risks\nHowever, Poon's and Dryja's proposal does not come without an element of associated risk.\nTime is of essence. Participants have to give each other enough time to complete the transaction. If not, invalid transactions may pass off as valid, enabling coins to be stolen.\nAdditionally, the developers explain that it is unlikely that all participants are honest. If a malicious party creates various channels and makes them all expire at once, this would overwhelm data capacity and would mean that the transaction would have to broadcast on to the chain.\nThis \"mass spamming\" of the bitcoin network could potentially delay transactions to the point where other timelocked transactions are also validated.\nThen there's the issue of connectivity. In this system, all parties must be online to use private keys. If someone's computer is compromised, counterparty theft may also take place.\nThe counterparty may also be able to steal funds if one of the participants losses data. This can be mitigated by installing a third-party data storage service where encrypted data gets sent to this third party service. Additionally, the white paper notes:\nCommunity reaction\nThe Bitcoin Lightning network is certainly a bold attempt at solving the blockchain's scalability issues. But, is it a viable one?\nPeter Todd, a bitcoin core developer, believes it is, although he says that it needs to be contextualised further.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Todd, said:\nThe prominent core developer said that while he was sure that Lightning could be a good system. He was noted that it will require more work to realise, as it's a much bigger project, one that also requires consensus from the community. \"It'll also require a soft fork to get off the ground,\" he concluded.\nDespite these relative shortcomings, Todd praised the system. He said that Lightning was proposing that users change how they use bitcoin in exchange for allowing the system to scale, without decreasing its security. He pointed out that for those who think that bitcoin is potentially under threat of regulation or attack, this was a good trade off to make.\nDryja and Poon coincide with Todd's reservations, agreeing that more works needs to be done before the project can completely take off. Dryja said:\nThe developer confirmed that they were still looking into easy-to-use messaging and authentication, independent of the bitcoin network.\nPoon confirmed that they are expecting to release a revised version of the white paper and that next steps would probably include the \"BIP (Bitcoin Improvement) and community input\".\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\nWhat do you think about the proposal?

Blockchain.info responded to his post and quickly moved to disable shared coin functionality.\nThe move was followed with a tweet letting users know that shared coin transactions had been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation:\nShared coin transactions were re-enabled four hours later, but further issues came to light and blockchain.info was taken down soon after.\nUser funds 'safe'\nThe Blockchain.info team traced the problem back to a database issue and it promptly tweeted that it would take \"several hours\" to resolve.\nBlockchain.info was quick to point out that it was not hacked and that all funds were safe throughout the outage, which was the result of a database bug. Since Blockchain.info does not hold any keys, there was no risk to users' coins.\nWallet function was not affected by the issue and user wallets could be restored even during the outage. A guide was published on the Blockchain.info blog, but it seems that many users did not get the message.\nOnce again the issue has proved that many bitcoin users aren't very informed about wallet technology, and even about some relatively basic principles.\nBlockchain.info was quick to reassure the public that there was no danger to funds, but the sudden influx of users looking for information quickly brought down the company blog and allowed misinformation to propagate through social networks.\nIn a statement Blockchain.info apologized for the extended outage and said it is working hard to restore services.\nBlockchain.info also published instructions on how to import wallet backups via MultiBit.\nLimited damage\nDespite the outage continuing for some hours, the issue has not been far reaching. A few services like ATM provider BitVendo have been affected, but the damage appears to be limited.\n— BitVendo (@BitVendo) March 18, 2014\nBlockchain.info informed CoinDesk that its team has been working around the clock and that progress is being made. All relevant updates will be posted on its blog.\n\"Once we're there, we will publish a full post-mortem of this unusual database issue,\" Blockchain said.\nIn light of recent security breaches and the Mt. Gox disaster, it is understandable that much of the bitcoin community is edgy. At least in this case the issue seems benign, even if annoying and disruptive.\nIt should be noted that Blockchain.info has been on a roll in recent months. In December it acquired bitcoin price app ZeroBlock, in January it announced the creation of its one-millionth wallet, and earlier this month it rolled out a new bitcoin app for merchants.\nBrowser image via Shutterstock",

It's a state of affairs that has arguably raised eyebrows among some observers and sparked warnings from the SEC as well as groups like FINRA about the risk of pump-and-dump scams.\nAs it stands, many of those firms are witnessing declines as of the market opening today.\nLong Island, for example, dropped more than 18 percent at the market open this morning, Yahoo! Finance data indicates.\nRiot Blockchain is down roughly 7 percent from yesterday's close, after dropping sharply in a movement similar to the one seen in the Long Island chart.\nBy comparison, LongFin is down about 9.6 percent. Indeed, its decline is a notable development given that the price jumped sharply from $36.76 to $142.82 after it announced that it had acquired a company said to be focused on blockchain development.\nTo be sure, today's price declines aren't as severe as the ongoing correction being seen in cryptocurrency markets, as CoinDesk reported this morning. For a detailed look at some of the charts that show this morning's price action, click here.\nAt the same time, the public stocks are seen by some observers as a proxy for interest in – as well as the hype around – the tech by traditional investors.

The startup was among a group of businesses representing the UK's fintech space during a state trade mission to Asia, which Cameron undertook in 2015.\nIn this week's remarks, Cameron voiced support for the use of blockchain tech in improving the transparency of governments, enabling the development of “a sense of trust in the institutions that we use”.\n\"I think you're on the brink of a very exciting revolution in all of those areas, which as someone involved in public life is very interesting,” he concluded.\nImage courtesy of Blockchain",
