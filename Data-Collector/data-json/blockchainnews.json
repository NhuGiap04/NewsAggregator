According to the statement, this newly launched project is “designed to capture the upside of crypto winter.”\nThe company stated that by leveraging the operating expertise of its affiliated digital asset mining, staking infrastructure firm, Foundry, to manage the day-to-day operations of GDIO (Grayscale Digital Infrastructure Opportunities), it plans to acquire mining equipment at reduced prices during the crypto winter.\n\"GDIO will use invested capital to purchase mining equipment. GDIO will then deploy this equipment to mine bitcoin, sell bitcoin daily, and distribute cash generated to investors, generating income,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale head of investor relations.\nFoundry, or Foundry USA, is under the same parent company as Grayscale, the Digital Currency Group. Foundry works as one of the biggest mining pools globally. Last year, Foundry USA ranked as the second-largest Bitcoin mining pool after China’s ban on crypto trading and mining activities.\n“As part of Foundry’s mission to empower a decentralized infrastructure, we’re excited to partner with Grayscale to broaden the ability to invest in bitcoin mining during this opportune time,\" said Foundry CEO Michael Colyer in a press statement from Grayscale.\nFurthermore, Grayscale said GDIO is now open for investment by the eligible individual and accredited institutional investors.\n“Our team has long been committed to lowering the barrier for investing in the crypto ecosystem – from direct digital asset exposure to diversified thematic products, and now infrastructure through GDIO.” Said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein.\nIn March, Foundry digital became a member of the Blockchain Association, a community of industry leaders advocating for the collaboration and innovation necessary to support American leadership in the crypto industry.",

    "summary": "Hong Kong-based nonprofit consortium Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) remains optimistic about the potential of blockchain in logistics, with a platform that rivals Maersk's TradeLens. Major shipping partners like Cosco and Hapag-Lloyd have already joined, with a permissioned blockchain allowing only authorized parties to access data. Despite past failures, GSBN CEO Bertrand Chen believes blockchain has yet to fully catch on and its adoption may take another decade.",
    "content": "Blockchain technology has had a rocky start in the logistics industry, with Danish logistics firm Maersk terminating its blockchain-based supply chain platform last year. However, Hong Kong-based Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) has not given up on blockchain applications in global trade. In fact, the nonprofit consortium sees blockchain as a crucial logistics tool in the long term.\nGSBN currently operates one of the world’s largest platforms that can be described as an alternative to Maersk’s TradeLens tool, according to a report by the South China Morning Post. The platform is based on a permissioned blockchain with strong data governance, allowing only authorized parties to contribute and consume shipping-related data.\nSince launching its blockchain-based shipping platform in 2021, GSBN has tapped major shipping partners like Cosco, Orient Overseas Container Line, and Hapag-Lloyd. In addition, the organization has also reached partnerships with terminal operators such as Hutchison Ports, SPG Qingdao Port, PSA International, Shanghai International Port Group, and Cosco Shipping Ports. Among the members, only German Hapag-Lloyd and Singaporean PSA International are not based in mainland China or Hong Kong.\nDespite past failures of major industry firms like Maersk in implementing similar projects, GSBN CEO Bertrand Chen is confident that blockchain technology has yet to fully catch on and its adoption may take another decade. However, with the world's largest shipping companies on board, the potential of blockchain in logistics seems promising.\nThe use of blockchain technology in the logistics industry has been a topic of discussion for several years. It is seen as a tool that can increase transparency and efficiency, as well as reduce fraud and errors. However, the adoption of blockchain has been slow due to concerns about security, scalability, and interoperability.\nGSBN's permissioned blockchain platform addresses some of these concerns. With strong data governance, it allows only authorized parties to access data, reducing the risk of data breaches. In addition, by bringing together major shipping partners and terminal operators, the platform aims to increase efficiency and reduce the time and costs associated with shipping.\nWhile Maersk's failed blockchain platform may have dampened enthusiasm for blockchain in logistics, GSBN's platform shows that there is still potential for blockchain in the industry. As the platform gains more traction and more companies adopt blockchain technology, the logistics industry may see a shift towards more transparent and efficient supply chain management.",

    "content": "Kazakhstan-based crypto miners have been witnessing an unprecedented situation as they find themselves surrounded by uncertainty due to political forces.\nThe country’s fast-growing cryptocurrency mining industry was affected last week when it was trapped in a nationwide internet shutdown amid a deadly uprising that began with protests in the west of Kazakhstan against a New Year's Day fuel price hike.\nThe move likely prevented Kazakhstan-based miners from accessing the bitcoin network, Reuters reported.\nWhile CNBC said, citing comments from Kevin Zhang of digital currency company Foundry, the internet blockage sent an estimated 15% of the world’s bitcoin miners offline.\nOn January 7th, due to the volatile situation bitcoin tumbled under $41,000 as it slumped as much as 5% to its lowest since late September.\nEthereum also saw a dip as it dropped below $3,200 Friday morning after trading above $4,000 for much of December 2021.\nCryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are created or \"mined\" by using high-powered computers which are interconnected globally and compete with each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a highly energy-intensive process.\nAccording to the most recent data available from August 2021, Kazakhstan accounted for 18% of the global \"hashrate\" - a crypto term for the amount of power being used by computers linked to the bitcoin network.\nIn April, before China's latest clampdown on bitcoin mining, the figure was just 8%.\nCrypto mining scene\nSince the Chinese clampdown of cryptocurrencies in 2021, many crypto miners migrated to the United States and Kazakhstan, which has led the two countries to become the first and second-largest centres for bitcoin mining respectively.\nAlthough reports have stated that the internet services have now been restored, the situation raises a question about the confidence of crypto miners towards the tightly controlled former Soviet state's political stability and future scenario of the domestic crypto landscape.\nAccording to a November 26, 2021, report by Blockchain.News, power shortages have already been causing some cryptocurrency mining firms to leave Kazakhstan and move to other nations.\nCrypto mining company Xive announced on November 24 that it will move its mining farm out of Southern Kazakhstan due to electricity shortages.\nDidar Bekbau, the co-founder of Xive cryptocurrency mining firm, talked about the development and said that the firm is shutting down a 2,500-rig mine in South Kazakhstan because of a lack of adequate electricity supply from the national grid.\nCrypto miners such as Energix and Xive, have been facing electricity issues since September 2021 because of the rationing from KEGOC, the national grid operator of Kazakhstan.\nBekbau disclosed that some crypto mining firms are moving from the country to places like Russia and the U.S. as there are no options left in Kazakhstan.\nKazakhstan's crypto landscape was not as gloomy as it is now.\nAccording to a September 3, 2020, report by Blockchain.News, the crypto miners safe haven had confirmed in a government meeting that the country was on track with its crypto mining farm projects.\nThe Minister of Digital Development, Bagdat Mussin, had said that the country was in talks to attract about 300 billion tenges ($714 million) of investment to fund the project which it first proposed back in July.\nWhile in June 2022, the central Asian country made plans to attract $738 million in investments related to cryptocurrencies and digital mining activities over the next three years.",

    "content": "After many votes in favour of it, the decentralized lending protocol Compound has decided to pause the supply of four tokens used as lending assets for collateral on the platform.\nDue to their low liquidity in the market, Compound protocol recently set out a proposal to the community for halting four tokens, including cZRX, cBAT, cMKR, and cYFI.\nAccording to the Proposal, if these tokens don’t get paused, an oracle manipulation-based attack similar to the one that cost Mango Markets millions of dollars is much less likely to occur on the Compound protocol due to these tokens' much less liquidity.\nOverall, this proposal has received overwhelming support from the community, with approximately 554,126 votes in favour of it, representing 99.99% of the votes. Only a single voter cancelled the proposal by voting against it.\nThe compound protocol has now fulfilled the proposal and paused these tokens. This means the said tokens will not be available to users to deposit and/or take loans in order to protect the protocol from market manipulation attacks.\nCompound founder Robert Leshner, who voted in favour of the Proposal, said in an Unchained Podcast that the Mango exploits served as a wakeup call for lending protocols. Because of that, lending protocols should put it into consideration to review their risk parameters.\n“Every protocol has to address the risk parameters assuming that some black hat hacker is going to try to exploit it. It’s a great wake-up call for every DeFi project on every single blockchain to take this as a wake-up call,” said Leshner.\nThe Mango Markets hack is indeed a caution for protocols in the DeFi ecosystem to take note of. The hacker stole over $100 million from the trading and lending platform after manipulating the price of the Mango Market's native MANGO token via an oracle price manipulation attack.",

    "summary": "If Ethereum can continue to dominate gaming spaces and build on its marketplace, fighting off other platforms in the market, then 2020 could be a significant year for the cryptocurrency. Learn more about why below.",
    "content": "The Ethereum blockchain has been a platform enabling new tokens' initial life in cryptocurrency. Many developers use Ethereum as the go-to chain to create their business and tokenonomy (Token economy) before launching into the markets on exchanges and other services.\nAlready in 2020, the price has seen significant increases, rising from $120 to over $225 in under two months. But is there any reason why?\nIn 2019, Ethereum decentralized apps (Dapps) showed huge advancements in popular segments including gaming and sports.\nFollowing 2019’s growth, wallet holders have seen huge further increases during the start of 2020, with over 80% of new daily active wallets in use from Dapps as well as games and marketplace users jumping up a huge 163%.\nGames are the most popular category on Ethereum’s decentralized marketplace, with the segment seeing a 7% increase in titles and new launches over the past months for players to enjoy.\nThe continued increase and interest in gaming alone is a huge reason why Ethereum continues to expand and attract new users. This could certainly be seen as to why the price has also seen steady rises. In January 2020 we can conclude that after a 7% increase so soon in the year, Ethereum is showing signs of real promise.\nIf Ethereum can continue to dominate gaming spaces and build on its marketplace, fighting off other platforms in the market, then 2020 could be a significant year for the cryptocurrency. Gaming, sports, and decentralized finance will be the driving factor as well as how the latest updates to the chain affect performance. The timing comes when the long-awaited Constantinople update will finally take place as well, creating quite the momentum for blockchain's largest and robust platform.",

    "summary": "China’s President Xi Jinping is calling for greater collaboration among ASEAN member states and has asked them to promote a ‘Digital Silk Road’ in the region.",
    "content": "As China moves to cement its influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to further strengthen cooperation and promote a “digital Silk Road” with ASEAN member states.\nOn November 27, President Xi assured the Asian leaders that China’s top priority is to develop its relationship with the Asean (Associations of Southeast Asian Nations) – 10 countries in the Southeast Asian region including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Myanmar.\nXi’s speech comes just two days after President-elect Biden announced that his foreign policy agenda would see the U.S strengthens its relations and initiate a new leadership role in the Asia-Pacific.\nWhile speaking via a video link to partners and participants at the China-ASEAN Expo in the Southwest Chinese city of Nanning, Xi said:\nXi said this while referring to his Belt and Road initiative project to build infrastructure, investment, and trade along both ancient maritime and land Silk Roads (sea and land routes connecting South Asia and East Asia with Persia, South Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and Southern Europe).\nXi mentioned that China aims to collaborate with Asean nations to develop a “China-Asean digital port to promote digital connectivity, and build a ‘digital Silk Road’.”\nXi revealed his plans to lead China towards building close relationships with Asean to address pressure from the prolonged trade war caused by US President Trump in 2018.\nChina Embracing Blockchain Technology\nSo far there is no suggestion that the digitalization would involve the use of blockchain technology. However, President XI previously praised and regarded the technology as a breakthrough application, saying that China should seize opportunities presented by blockchain. Xi reiterated the importance of blockchain and the need to accelerate the development of the technology in the country in various sectors. Over 500 blockchain projects have been registered with China’s government.\nChina is poised to take the lead in blockchain after the country’s leader President Xi gave a strong backing to the technology. The move sets to allow the world’s second-largest economy to control the development of the nascent technology in the absence of competition from the U.S and Europe.\nAs China seeks to develop closer ties and trade relations in the Asean region, it is possible that the digital yuan, a CBCD project by China’s Central Bank, would be accepted in these countries. China intends to build a payment network autonomous from the U.S dollar, which remains the most popular medium for international business transactions. As the world moves to digital, China authorities remain committed to launching digital yuan so that the CBDC could get dominance by facilitating cross-border transactions in the region.",

    "content": "Jeremy Allaire, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Circle, a US-based peer-to-peer payments company, has sent a letter to the United States Treasury Department calling for an improved regulation that can offer a “meaningful safe harbor” for players within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nAllaire’s letter was inspired by the recent news that the outgoing Donald Trump’s administration through the Treasury Department is planning to enact a regulatory ban over self-hosted crypto wallets.\nIn his letter, Jeremy recanted his experience at the beginning of the internet boom decades ago noting that he correctly predicted that the then-emerging technology will take over open communications networks despite the imminent fears of risks that prevailed at the time. Jeremy noted that the events of 1996 are seemingly playing out with open-source blockchain networks of today, a move the government is planning to clamp down on.\nHe also noted that the innovations of public blockchains are currently been used around the world to service clients across various industries and that any attempt to bring in strict regulations will give China an upper hand in the race for supremacy in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems.\nAllaire noted that the industry is working assiduously to prevent the technology from been harnessed by bad actors, which is one of the basic and biggest fears of the Treasury Department. Per the Circle CEO's words:\nThe CEO then suggested that the Treasury Department should give the industry players about a year or two to implement technologies that can help in ensuring compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and other transaction-reporting requirements, a move that will not hinder the innovations currently available in the blockchain ecosystem.\nJeremy Allaire's proposal echoes some US lawmakers who have also expressed concerns over the proposed legislation as reported by Blockchain.news.",

Compared with the end of last year, many investors, mainly retail investors, are worried about the current cryptocurrency.\nThat's according to 950 responses to MLIV Pulse's weekly survey from retail investors, portfolio managers, and strategists around the world.\n60% of respondents said that Bitcoin is likely to halve in value, and the coin is more likely to fall to $10,000 than to rebound to $30,000.\nBitcoin's price hasn't touched the $10,000 mark since September 2020, compared to an all-time high of over $68,000 in November last year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $20414 during the Asia trading section.\nJared Madfes, the partner at Tribe Capital, a venture capital firm, emphasized that expectations for further Bitcoin declines reflect \"inherent fear in the market\", adding, \"It's very easy to be fearful right now, not only in crypto, but generally in the world.\"\nAccording to the latest MLIV Pulse survey, 28% of respondents feel confident in the future of cryptocurrencies, but 20% said they are worthless.\n\"Bitcoin still is powering large parts of the crypto-verse, while Ethereum is losing its lead,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., a foreign-exchange broker.\nBitcoin's development remains bumpy.

Earlier this week, the system got a further boost after an upgrade designed to make it faster and more energy-efficient.\nAlso, Ethereum’s demand for smart contracts continued to top the charts this week.\nSmart contracts are self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology that decreases the demand for centralized intermediates. They have been in high demand in booming sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

    "summary": "Argo not only mined more Bitcoins in July, but also generated higher revenues than the previous month. The crypto mining firm faced challenges of electricity costs and its 17 series machines during the month of July.",
    "content": "Argo Blockchain plc, a publicly traded cryptocurrency mining firm based in the UK, on Friday, announced its operational update for July 2022.\nDuring the month of July, Argo revealed that it mined 219 Bitcoins as compared to 179 BTCs in June 2022.\nThe company further said its mining revenue in July amounted to £3.89 million [$4.73 million] compared to June's £3.38 million ($4.35 million).\nAs of 31 July 2022, Argo said it held 1295 Bitcoins, out of which BTC Equivalents were 227.\nMining Hardware Machines Update\nDuring the month of July, Argo stated that it completed its machine swap of about 10,000 S19s Antminers, which were hosted with Core Scientific, and finalized its strategic pivot to a self-hosted business model.\nAs a result of the completion of its machine swap, Argo said it now expects to generate better performance from its mining machines and have greater control of operations, including operational expenses.\nApart from that, Argo mentioned that in July it faced operational challenges with its 17 series machines. The company, therefore, conducted a comprehensive review of its entire mining fleet, with a focus on its S17 and T17 miners (collectively, the \"17 series machines\").\nAs a result, Argo identified that it was not the only miner affected by the hitches associated with its 17 series machines. There were also high failures among the 17 series machines in other crypto mining firms in the sector.\nDespite Argo removing the non-operational 17 series machines, its total hashrate at the end of July was around 2.23EH/s. This figure took into account the company’s continued installation of the S19J Pros ordered from Bitmain and the completion of the Core machine swap.\nPeter Wall, Argo's CEO, talked about the development: \"We would like to thank Core Scientific for acting as an invaluable and reliable business partner in this transition period which represents a crucial step for Argo's future development. The completion of the S19 machine's swap marks a further consolidation of our infrastructure, allowing us to retain further control of our operations and adjust them in accordance with our needs at any given time. While there have been some challenges in operating the 17 series machines, we are pleased with the ROI we have achieved on this portion of our mining infrastructure.\"\nFinancing Deal\nMoreover, during the month of July, Argo said it sold 887 Bitcoins at an average price of around $22,670. The firm said it used the proceeds to reduce obligations under a BTC-backed loan agreement with Galaxy Digital and to fund operating expenses and growth capital.\nAs of 31 July 2022, Argo mentioned it had an outstanding balance of $6.72 million under the BTC-backed loan, a huge reduction from the maximum outstanding balance of $50 million in Q2 2022.\nHelios Power Activities\nDuring the month of July, Argo's electricity costs at its Helios facility in Texas continued to rise higher than anticipated in the past. Electricity costs have increased around the world, mainly because of higher natural gas prices stemming from the war in Ukraine, as well as increased demand for electric-powered air conditioning during an unusually hot and dry summer.\nIn the middle of July, Argo said ERCOT (The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc) – a US organization that operates Texas's electrical grid –issued a conservation alert urging all residential, commercial, and industrial electricity users to reduce electricity consumption during specific afternoon hours when electricity demands were at its highest.\nAs a result, Argo and major large-scale Bitcoin miners in Texas, proactively shut down their mining operations and reduced usage by over 1,000 MW, thereby reducing strain on the grid during peak demand.",

It improves scalability, enabling it to process more transactions at a lower cost.\nIn Matter Labs' latest Medium blog post, the firm announced its layer 3 launch, described as the “path towards unlocking unlimited scalability and customization.”\nThis Layer 3 network will amplify all the benefits of Layer 2 and enable limitless scaling with limitless customization.\n“With zkSync’s Layer 3 solution, developers will be able to choose from 3 data availability options all using the same proving infrastructure for their project. Developers can choose their own trade-offs between price, performance, and security,” said Matter Labs in the announcement.\nThe firm further stated that their Layer 2 solution, zkSync, is there to provide the necessary foundation for the scaling of Ethereum in the ecosystem without devaluing its security or decentralization. But beyond that, it is their vision that unlimited scalability, and as a result, mass adoption comes from Layer 3 and beyond.\nFurthermore, Matter Labs explained that the layer 3 solution, Pathfinder, will replace non-native bridges with native bridges (or “HyperBridges”) and enable native bridging between blockchains.\nNative bridging is moving tokens from one blockchain to another without locking or giving tokens to an intermediary ‘escrow’ bridging platform.\nOnce zkSync finally launches its layer 3 network, it could solve one of the industry's main pain points, as billions of dollars have been stolen through exploits of non-native bridges between Layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains in the past year.\nLast week, the crypto industry witnessed another on-chain hack, with roughly $100 million of Binance Coin (BNB) stolen after an exploit occurred on a bridge between blockchains.\nAccording to figures from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, a total of $2 billion has been lost to breaches on cross-chain bridges this year.\nWith this massive amount of money lost to breaches on cross-chain bridges, a Layer 3 network like Pathfinder, which enables the act of native bridging, could be just what the industry needs to avoid these bridge hacks.",

It stated that the action was being taken to fight fraud and illegal outflow of domestic capital.\nThe bank also announced that any Nepali or foreigner living in Nepal and Nepalis abroad is liable to prosecution or further investigation if they are found to be dabbling in virtual currencies.\nNepal Bankers’ Association, the umbrella organisation of commercial banks, shares a similar sentiment towards cryptocurrencies.\nThe association said that virtual currency and network marketing business and transactions are illegal in Nepal.\nHowever, despite warnings, Nepalis have not backed away from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to local media. A report from Nepali Trends said that “cryptocurrency can be the future currency in the world… So, there is a huge suspect that some people are still transacting bitcoin.”\n“It seems that Nepalese are investing in several ways.

    "content": "Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager has opened public trading for two prominent altcoins, the Grayscale Trust for Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.\nGrayscale Investments has announced eligible Shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust will be available to trade on OTC Markets under the symbol: BCHG and eligible Shares of Grayscale Litecoin Trust will be available to trade on OTC Markets under the symbol: LTCN.\nThe institutional-grade digital asset investment firm Grayscale, has launched these public altcoin offering after receiving the approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) back in July.\nThe BCHG and LTCN trusts are not registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but allow mainstream investors exposure to cryptocurrency assets without having to buy and store the tokens themselves.\nInstitutional Interest in Crypto Investments Skyrockets\nGrayscale investments company has been at the forefront of providing a means of investing in cryptocurrency without having to actually hold the digital assets. This service has gained lots of popularity among traditional investors who want to bypass volatility in the crypto space.\nThe Trusts have offered private placements to accredited investors since March 2018. As of July 31, 2020, there were 2,500,800 Shares outstanding of LTCN and each Share represented ownership of 0.09413112 Litecoin. Shares created through each Trust’s respective private placement become eligible to sell into the public market after a statutory one-year holding period under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nAll investors with access to US securities will be able to buy and sell freely-tradable shares of BCHG and LTCN through their investment accounts in the same manner as they would other unregistered securities.\nThere is currently $16.8 million worth of BCH under management in the Bitcoin Cash Trust and $13.5 million in Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust. The New York-based Grayscale will take a 2.5% cut of the trust each year—this means that the amount of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin held in its trust will decrease over time.\nGrayscale has been providing several cryptocurrency products for OTC trading, and the latest being shares of the company’s Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash Trusts for trading on OTC markets. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are now the company’s sixth and fifth publicly-traded cryptocurrency products.\nIn the recent past, the company obtained approval to offer shares for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Ethereum (ETH). Zcash (ZEC), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Horizen (ZEN), and XLM are also offered for trading via a trust at the company. These are the largest coins by marketcap on the market, except for Chainlink which recently surged into fifth position.",

    "content": "The Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) has granted the very first cryptocurrency service registration to the Amsterdam Digital Asset Exchange (AMDAX). Per the landmark registration status, AMDAX can now engage in the processing and custody of digital currencies in line with the European guideline on anti-money laundering guidelines dubbed AMLD5.\nThe co-founder and director of the Amsterdam based exchange Valentino Cremona noted that the registration shows that bitcoin (BTC) investment is actually very transparent as against the general notion that it is only used for scams. The Director also noted that the DNB approval is a step in setting the precedent for a clear regulatory framework that the entire cryptocurrency market needs.\nAlso drawing on the positives of the DNB nod, Cremona noted that “Whereas a growing number of investors consider Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies as an interesting long-term investment, up until today they were operating on a market that was not regulated. In a time when traditional financial certainties are under pressure, we can offer clients a safe and reliable alternative. As a result of this registration, the crypto domain will also be accessible for private investors and financial institutions.”\nThe Dutch Central Bank’ Nudging Producing Result\nAs one of the major European powerhouses, De Nederlandsche Bank has been up on its toes to bring cryptocurrency firms under a unifying regulation. Blockchain.News reported earlier that the apex bank issue an instruction back in May giving crypto firms a two-week ultimatum to register else, they will face a cease and desist pronouncing halting their operations.\nThe granting of the registration status to AMDAX is one of the positive results from this order and more may come in the coming weeks. The DNB has had its hands tied with the CBDC pursuit and from the recent move with AMDAX, it is obvious the bank is trying not to let there be any loose ends in regulations in anticipation of the digital euro.",

    "content": "The First Pocket Gamer and Blockchain Gamer Connects Hong Kong wows the crowds: more than 750 delegates from 45 countries attend a new B2B gaming conference! The temperature outside may have been in the high 30s, but that was nothing compared to the white-hot talks and meetings taking place inside Hong Kong’s awesome Cyberport venue on 17-18 July, at Steel Media’s inaugural Blockchain Gamer Connects and Pocket Gamer Connects in East Asia. The conference and expo, hosted in association with Animoca Brands and Cyberport, pulled in the great and the good of the games industry from across the region as well as overseas with over 750 delegates registering in total from 45 countries. Less than half of the attendees (48.6%) were from Hong Kong, with 15.5% traveling from mainland China, 6.6% from the United States, 4.4% from Korea, 3.3% Japan and 2.6% hailing from the United Kingdom. The emerging market of South East Asia was well represented too, with attendees from Singapore, Philipines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand (making up over 7.7% of delegates) whilst Russia and mainland Europe collectively brought in 7.8% and the Middle East and Australasia were also represented.\nThese delegates enjoyed over 55 hours of talks and panels delivered across three packed tracks rooms. Over the span of two days, 131 speakers shared their insight on mobile, esports and blockchain gaming. Highlights included keynotes by Yuichiro Saito (Cygames), Allison Bilas (JoyPac), Sandeep Nailwal (Matic Network), and Huabin Ling (Cocos2dx). The crowd was thrilled by Superstar Sessions on player-owned economies (John Linden, Mythical Games); how gameplay comes first (Kern Zhang, App Annie); scaling Ethereum games (Matt Campbell, Loom Network); and community building (Marguerite deCourcelle, Blockade Games). There were 14 panels, including a lively discussion about the future of instant games, hypercasual and casual games, led by Gamejam’s Christian Calderon.\nMaking Connections Outside of the track rooms, attendees used the free meeting system to schedule 280 hours of business one-to-ones. There were also curated sessions (Investor Connector, and Publisher SpeedMatch), which were invitation-only get-togethers that took place smoothly behind the main stage, bringing together studios, publishers, and investors from around the globe. There were 20 entrants in the Very Big Indie Pitch, the competition that challenges indie developers to pitch their games to panels of experts in speed-dating style quickfire rounds. The ultimate winner was Minidragon, a small company founded in 2013 and are based in Cyberport, Hong Kong. Their game Pixel Petz walked away with the ceremonial baseball bat after impressing the judges with their pitch. 390 companies joined PG and BG Connects Hong Kong 2019 in total. As always at a Connects event, there was a wonderful cross-over of industries, from students to CEOs and top investors. 40% of the registered attendees were C-level.\nSponsors and Supporters Our platinum sponsors were Cyberport and Animoca Brands, who co-organized the event. The event was also supported by Xsolla, Lab Cave, App Annie (gold); UPLTV, Genvid, JoyPac, Matic Network, PlasmaPlay, Minimob, iMoney, Cocos-BCX, Bino Viz (silver); Bluzelle, Upland and Cocos2d (track and associate sponsors). “This was our 19th B2B conference overall and our very first one in the Hong Kong region,” commented Steel Media COO Dave Bradley. “We could not have been more pleased with the support we received from the local and international games community. There was an incredible amount of talent on show in both the blockchain and mobile sides of the event. It seems that many new business connections were made. And as always at a Connects event, the vibe was relaxed and friendly, with the party on Tuesday night – with conversations spilling out onto the Cyberport terrace – a particular highlight! We’ll definitely be back in this fascinating city.”\nNext Up\nThe next destination for the international series of events is the sixth edition of Pocket Gamer Connects Helsinki on October 1-2 before wrapping up the year with the first-ever Pocket Gamer Connects Jordan on November 2-3. In 2020, the series will start the year by returning home to London on January 20-21. https://www.pgconnects.com/helsinki/",

Now, the adoption on payment systems may speed up due to the threat from competitors such as Facebook that use cryptocurrencies to facilitate seamless payments across their global users.\nDirector general of the European Payments Council (EPC), Etienne Goosse commented on the impact of Facebook Libra “They come with a global solution, under a global brand offering many things that the consumers seem to find wonderful.” Goosse added that instant payments are being adopted by 60% of lenders and payment service providers within the eurozone, and it is expected to reach to all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020.\nThe European Central Bank launched the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) in November 2018, which enables real-time transaction mitigating fragmentation risks in the European retail payments market. However, it is argued that these mechanisms are not interoperable among lenders that are not members of the same clearinghouse, and each of these systems that cover only a few dozen banks.\nThumbnail image credit: Shutterstock",

    "summary": "Data don’t lie. New research from KPMG investigated how consumers feel about the application of blockchain digital tokens. It turned out that consumers believe that the blockchain-baked tokenization could significantly transform the way businesses interact with the public. But it emerged that most businesses have not embraced the new technology. Now, you can guess the implications.",
    "content": "According to the latest survey commissioned by KPMG, US consumers are more willing to use blockchain tokens. The study released this week indicates that regardless of background or age, US consumers are becoming more open to using digital currency tokens.\nWith advanced technology tools being applied, they become more familiarized with the use of various forms of virtual currency as a means of payment.\nBut what does this mean for businesses? Aplenty. Thanks to the increased adoption of blockchain technology.\nBusinesses are discovering new uses for tokens which can securely and accurately track the change of value across C2C, B2C, and B2B environments.\nIn particular, the willingness and readiness to embrace tokenization show much about consumers. In the entire recent history of technological advancements, it is the consumers who have influenced the evolution of innovation models from concept ideology to acceptance.\nConsumers were the first to embrace high-speed data and e-commerce. Furthermore, it was consumers who driven the acceptance of smartphones.\nMoreover, it is the consumer who is already influencing the marketing for blockchain digital tokens.\nNow, let us analyze the key findings of KPMG’s recent research to understand the perceived benefits of virtual currency tokens.\nEarly Adopters: Generation Z\nGeneration Z is more accepting tokenization than any other demographic generations. 83% of U.S. citizens surveyed, ages 18 to 24, identify themselves as being interested in the use of tokens in the future. More surprisingly, over half of older Americans, - ages 65 and up – mention that they are also interested in using tokens in their business transactions.\nSince consumers across generations increasingly show the willingness to accept and appreciate the use of digital tokens, the opportunities in a C2C or B2C environment seem endless.\nGeneration Z is a blockchain generation. This generation is characterized by people who were born after 1995. One characteristic recognized among these people is that they are immensely inclusive pragmatists. We all know that they are cryptocurrency-friendly. However, how they embrace democratic socialism, decentralization underlying blockchain tech, and new app experiences that leverage peer-to-peer commerce undoubtedly shows the future.\nEasy Method of Payment\nAn estimate of 63% of the Americans surveyed mentioned they regard blockchain digital tokens as an easy method of paying goods and services.\nNot my words, you can clearly see that generation Z is a new generation of customers. They see tokens as better than cash. Also, they see tokens as global, instant, and easy to use. The instant settlement, and near-zero fees, and no chargebacks are some of the plenty of benefits associated with tokens.\nTokens give consumers the freedom to move their money any way they want.\nTokens have stability and low-price volatility because they are pegged to major fiat currencies such as the US dollar, Pounds, or Euros. This explains the reason consumers commonly use blockchain digital tokens to facilitate the exchange of services and goods.\nStability and low-price volatility remain the key in digital currency as they ensure that sellers and buyers do not lose in a trading activity because of price fluctuations underlying in the payment instrument.\nTokens, therefore, work excellently for practical use of digital currencies involving trade activities between consumers and businesses on a blockchain network as a unit of accounting, a medium of exchange, and store of value for everyday and routine transactions of both small and large values.\nAs applications that make use of blockchain technology and digital tokens become more mainstream, they assist in providing global suppliers, consumers, and merchants with more secure, faster, and cheaper alternatives to wire transfers, debit cards, credit cards, and cash.\nThe Use of Loyalty Rewards\nKPMG research indicates that approximately 55% of the respondents surveyed said tokens would enable them to make use of loyalty rewards in more meaningful ways.\nYes, I’m now talking about ‘earning’ points here.\nYou may have experienced grocery store rewards, hotel reward points, or ‘earning’ air miles. My assumption remains true because several points programs have been running for years, and numerous millions of consumers have benefited from them.\nVarious companies run reward programs to encourage consumers to buy more.\nThe more you earn the points, the better, and the points you ‘earn’ are stored in the company’s database.\nNowadays, you can earn tokens just like earning points from the company you’ve been transacting goods and services with.\nSeveral consumers associate ‘loyalty’ with ‘points’ from credit cards, hotels, airlines, and others. With such programs, the connection is clear between future benefits and today’s purchase.\nOne airline introduced a digital loyalty program running on blockchain as a way of encouraging its clients to use their points in smaller amounts. With tokens, consumers can use the digital wallet to buy a variety of merchants like restaurants, hotels, departmental stores, and more. Also, consumers can transfer points from a particular merchant to another (e.g., an airline to a hotel) or vice versa.\nOf the 1000 U.S. residents surveyed in the KPMG research, 82% revealed they are more willing to use tokens with businesses they already purchase from.\nAlso, 81% said they would be inclined to trust tokens they get through a loyalty system of a business. This promotes their confidence and trust in those enterprises. This also makes tokenization an instrument for business production and maintaining loyalty.\nBut, according to the study, now the main challenge is that there aren’t several businesses using digital tokes for rewards programs.\nThe survey shows that about 86% of respondents felt great loyalty to the coffee shops and restaurants they visited, as well as their banks of choice. Another 81% expressed loyalty to electronic firms, whereas 79% mentioned they were consistent customers of some media and telecom firms.\nFinal Thought\nKMPG reveals that businesses which aren’t taking advantage of digital assets and tokenization for rewards, and don’t already have a loyalty program in place, are missing out great opportunities. By utilizing tokenization, businesses can build new forms of the value of exchange in an existing network like allowing consumers to utilize loyalty points for purchases with a variety of merchants.\nThe technology is in place, and the market is ready. It is time for businesses across sectors and of all sizes to embrace blockchain digital tokens and tokenization to revolutionize their business models. Otherwise, they risk being left behind.",

    "content": "The Colombian Ministry of Information Technology and Communications (MinTIC) believes blockchain and DLT solutions could benefit nearly a dozen of the country’s public services and have released a draft to guide sector implementation.\nColombia’s MinTIC is calling for around ten public sectors to adopt blockchain solutions with a new draft guide entitled, “DLT/Blockchain—Guide for the use and implementation of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT/Blockchain) in the public sector” released in August 2020.\nThe Ministry’s first draft guide explains the pros and cons of implementing blockchain and DLT infrastructure and calls for the public sector to leverage blockchain solutions including digital and crypto payments.\nCrediting Bitcoin\nMinTIC’s guide explains cryptocurrency blockchain and DLT at the beginning by quoting Satoshi Nakomoto’s original Bitcoin whitepaper (draft translation):\n“To start the discussion on the state of the art of DLTs, it should be specified that this term began its dissemination in the technology sector after the appearance of Blockchain (ITU-T Focus Group Digital Financial Services, 2017), which in turn was born with the launch of the document “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” that was published in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto, 2008).”\nThe Ministry goes on to explain that blockchain technology solutions in payments can remove third-party intermediaries and agents while maintaining public data security and transparency. MinTIC also cites use cases for—voting, supply chains, managing education records, healthcare, identity solutions, and the management of tax and public records.\nColumbia DLT Lags, China CBDC Progress Exaggerated\nThe guide for blockchain and DLT implementation in the public sector is also MinTIC’s warning that the country is falling behind the rest of the world in adopting blockchain. The draft discusses the rapid adoption by the EU, UAE, the United States, and China.\nWhile Colombia may be lagging, China has been reportedly continuously expanding the trials of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) significantly, and in the wealthier cities in the country. China’s CBDC is also known as the digital currency electronic payment (DCEP).\nChina’s Ministry of Commerce recently said that the digital yuan would be trialed in cities including Beijing, Tianjin, the Greater Bay Area, and Hebei province first, and the nation’s Ministry of Commerce added that the policy framework of the DCEP would be complete at the end of 2020.\nHowever, new reports state that the Chinese central bank has not set any specific timetable for its formal launch. The source from the report added that the digital currency is currently being tested in four areas and some sites for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The unnamed source said that “the pilot program has not yet been expanded on a large scale,\" and the test is just \"internal and closed.”",

    "content": "Brazil initiates the use of blockchain technology in issuing the National Identity Card (CIN), enhancing the security of the new identity issuance process. The shared registration platform, developed by Serpro, facilitates secure data sharing between the Federal Revenue of Brazil (RFB) and Civil Identification Bodies (OICs). The adoption begins in Goiás, Paraná, and Rio de Janeiro, with a nationwide implementation deadline set for November 6, 2023, as per Decree No. 10,977 of February 23, 2022.\nBlockchain's Edge in Security\nBlockchain technology plays a pivotal role in personal data protection and fraud prevention, offering Brazilian citizens a more secure digital experience. The blockchain platform, dubbed b-Registers, is crucial for the security and reliability of the National Identity Card project, according to Serpro's president, Alexandre Amorim. Blockchain applications benefit from data immutability, making it nearly impossible to alter or counterfeit recorded data. Additionally, decentralization reduces vulnerability to cyberattacks, while the technology's transparency feature allows the tracing of all transactions and activities, enhancing user trust.\nImplementation Timelines\nThe transition to blockchain for CIN issuance starts in Goiás, Paraná, and Rio de Janeiro this week. Over the next six weeks, other states will follow suit. The decree mandates all issuing bodies to adopt the new CIN standards by November 6, 2023. Rogério Mascarenhas, the Secretary of Digital Government at the Ministry of Management and Public Services Innovation (MGI), emphasizes the importance of adhering to the set timeline, outlining the CIN project's significant impact on public safety and organized crime combat.\nCitizen-Centric Benefits\nIssued since July last year, the CIN incorporates new security elements like a secure QR Code and an automated reading zone, facilitating easy and secure checks by public safety forces. Besides the physical version, a digital version is available on the Gov.br app. A notable change is the adoption of the CPF as the national registration number, ensuring consistent citizen identification across all states.\nThe initiative aligns Brazil with global trends, as illustrated by a similar program in Buenos Aires, Argentina, granting residents digital wallet access to identity documents. Over the years, Brazil has been striving to unify identity issuance across its nearly 30 states, with blockchain technology significantly advancing this objective.\nThe announcement comes as Brazil explores a central bank digital currency (CBDC), named Drex, announced in August, marking a step towards modernized, secure, and efficient public service delivery.",

Harbor Square Investments is a subsidiary of a tokenized securities platform, Harbor. The news of the awarded license can be confirmed on FINRA’s BrokerCheck web service.\nThis move breaks the rather lengthy stand-off between the crypto firms and the regulatory bodies. The FINRA and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously outlined factors for considering agencies when determining the approval of a broker-dealer application. It explained that broker-dealers must comply with established laws and practices regarding losses or theft of security. These were however not available or effective in certain digital assets. The undue risks investors would face were the regulatory bodies’ concerns for the delayed licensing of many crypto firms.\nThe broker-dealer award affords a firm the ability to buy and sell securities for themselves or on behalf of their clients. Broker-dealers who treat digital assets as securities could market them to institutional investors. However, the strict requirements of FINRA and SEC regulate and restrict this. Harbor’s CEO explained that this was a new territory for the regulatory bodies. Hence, the time spent was required to enable them to understand the implications of the license and do it right.\nWith this broker-dealer award settled, Harbor plans to move things forward to become a one-stop-shop for digital assets issuers. It plans to provide technology to manage investors, raise funds, tokenize and enable liquidity. These processes were quite difficult prior to its licensure as the firm could not make partner broker deals without it. The firm was prohibited from handling other key processes like performing due diligence.\nThe broker-dealer license is a pathway for the firm to sail in all its businesses seamlessly.",

    "content": "On the eve of Bitcoin's Third Halving, the number of Bitcoin addresses and wallets hit an all time high.\nNotably, the number of Bitcoin addresses containing less than 1 BTC has more than doubled since the second halving in July 2016, with wallets containing less than 0.1 BTC showing the highest increase.\nAs revealed by Glassnode in a Tweet on May 11, the number of Bitcoin addresses have increased on the whole. Wallets holding less than 0.01 BTC now exceed 10 million, an increase of 235% from the Second to the Third Halving.\nThe second highest increase was in addresses holding between 0.01 BTC and 0.1 BTC which increased by 2014%. Perhaps worrisome for the market is the rise in whale accounts, or addresses that hold over 1000 BTC which marked a 13.2% increase.\nBitcoin Going Mainstream\nThe rise in small wallet addresses is evidence of the growing mainstream interest in Bitcoin and it appears that more people have been preparing for the potential post-halving bullrun.\nOn April 17, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of US-based crypto exchange Coinbase revealed data showing how $1,200 deposits similar to the stimulus checks being offered to Americans by the government have skyrocketed since the cheques started being sent out. Coinbase is the leading crypto exchange on American soil.\nThe information presented suggests that some Americans are looking at the other side of the coin in their stimulus checks as they are not using them to purchase food and goods. Instead, they are keeping their fingers crossed and investing in Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has also been becoming more popular with insitutional investors. Last night , the Bitcoin Price received a sudden bump above the $9000 mark when it was reported that billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones was looking to buy Bitcoin to hedge against inflation as central banks across the world are printing money to relieve economies affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\nJones is one of Wall Street’s most seasoned and successful hedge fund managers, CEO and founder of Tudor Investment Corp, a hedge fund that managed $8.4 billion assets under management as of March 30, based on data from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFollowing the Third Halving, the Bitcoin Price has taken its traditional dip in price and now sits at $8739, at time of writing.",

    "content": "Blockchain infrastructure firm Chain has completed the acquisition of Measurable Data Token (MDT), despite the slump in cryptocurrency prices.\nChain announced on Saturday that the $100 million deal will provide the company with assets, including MDT, cash-back application RewardMe and financial data protocol MeFi.\nChain offers developers cloud services to build blockchain-based applications. The unique aspect of this deal involves token conversion, where MDT will become Chain's native Token XCN, according to The Block.\nThe firm's internal M&A handled the deal, alongside advisers from Tanner De Witt and Rooney Nimmo, it added.\n\"With this acquisition, there will be a sunset of the Measurable Data Token (MDT), which will be burned and swapped for XCN token,\" a blog post said. \"MDT token holders will receive the benefit of the swap and will be expected to receive a $0.08 MDT token value for the swap.\"\nChain CEO Deepak Thapliyal said it was \"complicated and requires a lot of counter-party assistance\" when speaking about the process.\nHe added, \"we will need the assistance of exchanges to support the swap for tokens that are off-chain. The process will be a lot less complicated for tokens on-chain and will be available through a simple smart contract since we are both primarily ERC20 tokens.\"\nRecently, XCN was trading on Coinbase at $0.09 a coin.\nChain was founded in 2014 by non-fungible token (NFT) collector and investor, Thapliyal. He is known for purchasing an Alien Punk NFT for $23.5 million.",

    "content": "An impending agreement between the blockchain scaling technology firm StarkWare and Chainlink Labs will result in the addition of Oracle services, data feeds, and price feeds to the StarkNet ecosystem. This relationship will be established in the near future.\nBecause of the relationship, StarkWare will take part in Chainlink's Scale programme, and the price feeds for StarkNet's testnet will come from Chainlink. In addition, StarkNet tokens will be used to fund some operating expenditures for Chainlink oracle nodes. This access to Chainlink oracle services and data feeds will be provided to Starket developers via the usage of StarkNet tokens.\nChainlink is a decentralised oracle network that enables smart contracts to access off-chain data sources, application programming interfaces (APIs), and payment systems in a secure manner. It makes it possible for smart contracts to interact with data and events that take place in the real world, which in turn makes it possible for them to be triggered by data that originates from outside sources.\nThe network makes use of decentralised nodes, which are entrusted with the responsibility of delivering smart contracts with data that can be relied on and is secure. In exchange, these nodes are rewarded with payments in Chainlink's native LINK currency. The data that is supplied to smart contracts by node operators has been checked and calculated by those node operators before being submitted to smart contracts. This verifies that the information is accurate and may be relied upon.\nAccording to a statement that was released by StarWare, an economically feasible framework has been built between StarkNet and Chainlink. It is also hoped that the integration would provide developers working on StarkNet with the basic infrastructure needed to build \"highly performant, more sophisticated, and secure smart contract applications.\"\nOracles are an important part of the system, and their value can be seen in a wide range of applications because to the flexibility they provide. Knowledge about the current value of assets or NFTs is required for a significant number of applications. Oracles are often compared to extensive toolkits due to their breadth of functionality.",

    "content": "A group in the UK's House of Commons is now planning to launch an inquiry into the operation, risks, and benefits of NFTs and the blockchain at large, as well as to see how the industry could impart the UK economy.\nTaking the first move to regulate NFTs, the Members of Parliament or MPs will examine whether NFT investors, especially vulnerable speculators, are put at risk by the market.\n“NFTs swept through the digital world so fast that we had no time to stop and consider,” said Julian Knight, Chair of the DCMS Committee. Julian added, “Now that the market is veering wildly, and there are fears that the bubble may burst, we need to understand the risks, benefits, and regulatory requirements of this groundbreaking technology.”\nNotably, the outcome of the investigation is most likely to be concluded in regulation proposals that the Treasury will review.\nPer the announcement, Julian Knight believes investors, specifically the vulnerable ones, are at risk of being “swindled into buying NFTs” whose value may become worthless at purchase.\nJulian said the inquiry will scrutinize to see whether “greater regulation” could be needed to protect consumers at risk and the broader markets from “volatile investments.”\n“This inquiry will also help Parliament understand the opportunities presented by an exciting new technology which could democratize how assets are bought and sold,” Julian concluded.\nNotably, this update follows a report about the United Kingdom making further steps to becoming one of the most recognized crypto hubs in the world.\nLast month the House of Commons, the Parliament, passed an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill to regulate Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as financial instruments. The Bill was initially proposed when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was the Chancellor of the Exchequer and sought to regulate stablecoins.",

    "content": "According to Bloomberg, a decentralized finance project called Wonderland involving a felon associated with Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga has sparked widespread controversy, turning DeFi into a financial felon’s wonderland.\nSifu was identified by an anonymous Twitter user as Michael Patryn, the co-founder of the failed Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX.\nLaunched by Sestagalli and 0xSifu in September 2021, Wonderland runs on the Avalanche blockchain.\nThe Quadriga exchange has cost 76,000 investors in Canada and about C$169 million ($133 million) since the death of Quadriga co-founder Gerald Cotten in 2018 One of the most famous large-scale fraud incidents to date.\nErnst & Young, the trustee of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, published a report showing that almost 17,000 people have filed for the remaining assets of the crypto exchange in 2020.\nWonderland's native token is TIME, and the current total value locked in the protocol is nearly $680 million, falling to an all-time low of $335 on Thursday before recovering to around $440.\nCo-founder Daniele Sestagalli said Thursday that he asked Wonderland's treasurer, who goes by the alias Sifu or 0xSifu, to step down.\nA crypto wallet identified as belonging to Patryn appeared to be rapidly dumping various tokens on Thursday, with its total net worth dropping from $450 million to $70 million in a matter of hours, according to data from trackers DeBank and Zapper.\nMyCrypto founder Taylor Monahan also traced a note marking a wallet as Patryn's, which identified it as the Ethereum address of his Ledger hardware wallet.\nShe said the wallet is still active now, along with a transaction to 0xSifu’s address — a 17 ether ($42,500) transaction. This finding supports the fact that the two are the same person.\nMyCrypto founder Taylor Monahan noted that on-chain evidence supports Zach’s claims. In 2019, she tagged a wallet as Patryn's based on a note that identified it as the Ethereum address of his Ledger hardware wallet. She then showed that the wallet was still active, including transactions to 0xSifu’s address — such as a transaction of 17 ether ($42,500).\nAs reported by Blockchain.News on September 24，American over-the-top content platform and production company Netflix Inc is set to premiere a documentary revealing the fall of a once-popular Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCx and the dead of its founder, Chief Executive Officer Gerald Cotten.

    "content": "Egypt is facing a severe cash crunch as the country is feeling the economic pressure of the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank of Egypt has instructed local banks to begin restricting daily withdrawals and has instructed citizens not to withdraw so much money. The central bank’s current move is aimed to prevent a cash shortage and to control inflation and hoarding during the spread of coronavirus. So far, the country has about 36 coronavirus deaths and 576 infections. The closures in the nation are likely to be extended indefinitely.\nVirus tests the limits of central bank power\nEgypt’s central bank is under tremendous pressure as citizens are flooding the local ATMs to withdraw massive sums of cash in panic attempts to stay prepared for the worst-case scenarios. This seems to leave extremely little cash with the central bank. Instead, the central bank has issued directives to the local banks to impose cash withdrawal limits. The central bank’s new guidelines indicate that individuals will have a daily cash withdrawal limit of 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($640), while Egyptian companies can withdraw up to 50,000 Egyptian pounds. There will be exceptions for companies in case the money is being utilized to pay employees. Further, the central bank has informed local banks to limit ATM withdrawals as consumers now can only deposit and withdraw 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($316) per day at ATMs.\nMoreover, the central bank has told citizens to avoid paper currency and rather to adopt electronic transfers and e-payments so that to control the coronavirus spread. As of 30th March, all banks canceled fees on e-payments and electronic transfers for the citizens’ convenience. The day prior, the central bank began an electronic payments initiative to encourage citizens to stop using physical currency (cash). All bank fees have been canceled in the country as the central bank instructed local banks to delay credit penalties against organizations and customers and not to impose late payments on certain loans.\nAlthough there is no evidence indicating that Egyptian citizens are turning to Bitcoin amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many people seem to validate the need for cryptocurrencies. However, the central bank promotes the use of electronic payments, specifically credit cards and not any digital asset.\nBlockchain as leverage to combat the coronavirus outbreak\nWhile the world continues looking for ways to address the coronavirus pandemic, blockchain technology has proved to provide important solutions. Coronavirus has caused havoc on the world’s economy, with banks not only in Egypt but also in the US, Lebanon, and several countries have imposed cash limits. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is seen to have a lot to offer to the world to combat the coronavirus crisis, like offering a good alternative investment option for people. It remains to see if the coronavirus pandemic is enough to weaken the whole banking sector and make people turn to digital form of money like cryptocurrencies.",

    "summary": "With the number of transactions on Ethereum recording an all-time high and shooting up over the past few months, crypto experts are speculating on whether the network can keep up with the high demand whether its scalability is reliable enough.",
    "content": "Over the last couple of months, Ethereum has been experiencing a lot of exciting news, with its rally on the crypto market and its plans to launch its final 2.0 testnet, \"Medalla.\"\nWhat Explains The Higher Transaction Records on Ethereum?\nThe number of transactions on Ethereum has seen an all-time high and has shot up over the last few months. However, crypto experts are debating on whether the blockchain network can keep up and whether its scalability is reliable enough.\nCrypto investors have been speculating that the higher number of transactions that have been ongoing on Ethereum’s blockchain is attributed to the rise in popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Uniswamp and Compound. Another explanation debated upon by Ethereum experts is that the anticipated launch of ETH 2.0 testnet, Medalla, is causing an increasing amount of transactions processed on the blockchain.\nHowever, though these are valid explanations, there may be other reasons why Ethereum’s network activity has been soaring. Ponzi schemes such as Forsage, MMM and Lion’s Share seem to have something to do with Ethereum’s increased network activity. In fact, over the last month, these scam smart contracts were responsible for approximately 5,600 Ether (ETH) in gas fees over the last months. Since mid-July, it has also been recorded that at least 1 million daily transactions have been processed on Ethereum at the cost of 21 billion gas.\nGas Prices Inflated With Ponzi Schemes\nIf one were to solely look at smart contract activity running on the ecosystem, 57 billion transactions on the Ethereum blockchain network are allocated towards those transactions. Ponzi schemes make up about 17 billion of that consumption, and so almost 30% of smart contract activities can be accredited to fraudulent investing scams. Due to these scams, gas prices have undergone inflation and are priced from anywhere between 30-90 gwei, the most commonly used unit of Ether crypto.\nWith the rising popularity of Ethereum’s network and Ether prices continuously surging, Ethereum has been working on implementing a better scaling solution with ETH 2.0 to process the mass amount of transactions that are occurring on the blockchain.\nETH 2.0 Final Testnet Set to Launch\nCo-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has spoken up about Ethereum 2.0 earlier this year. The 2.0 multi-client testnet is set to launch on August 4, at 1 pm UTC, and the Ethereum community has been anticipating its release.\nEthereum executive coordinator Danny Ryan has confirmed that the criterion for the amount of validator the testnet needs to have pre-launch has been met.\nScalability of ETH 2.0\nIn the past, when discussing the developing blockchain, Buterin had disclosed that the data capacity of ETH 2.0 will be immense. However, as his blockchain ecosystem is still being perfected, the upgrade will not necessarily translate to higher scalable transactions for the time being, meaning that the blockchain will not necessarily process more transactions for now.\nEthereum On the Search For Cybersecurity Team\nEthereum developers are working on making the blockchain more scalable, more efficient, and faster, and they have been coming up with innovative solutions to maximize and improve the performance of Ethereum 2.0 testnet before the launch of ETH 2.0 mainnet.\nJust yesterday, Ethereum 2.0 researcher Justin Drake took to his Twitter platform and announced that Ethereum Foundation was looking to build an “internal security team dedicated to Eth2.”",

This service aims to help crack down unlawful crypto usage worldwide.\nOffering crypto investigative assistance\nThe unveiling of this program comes in the wake of the biggest seizure of Bitcoin worth $1 billion by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ), originating from an unnamed hacker earlier this month.\nChainalysis played a pivotal role in this capture because it provided blockchain analytical tools, which enabled law enforcers to scrutinize and pinpoint crypto wallets used to aid the sale of narcotics on Silk Road, a leading darknet marketplace before it was shut down by law enforcement.\nThe blockchain company will partner with Asset Reality in its mission to launch an asset realization program, because the latter has expertise in the sale of seized funds, given that it realizes and manages confiscated assets for global clients.\nBuilding trust in crypto assets\nJason Bonds, the chief revenue officer at Chainalysis, acknowledged that cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming mainstream, resulting in both good and bad actors being attracted by digital assets. He said:\nChainalysis has shown its devotion to revamp the crypto space by eradicating illegal activities. For instance, in September, it joined hands with the Wyoming Division of Banking to fight cybercrime and illicit activities pertaining to crypto laundering, crypto scams, sanctions violations, and more.\nThe analytics company has also been helping the crypto industry grow with the data accumulated during their analysis of blockchain activity. In August, it disclosed that cryptocurrency assets valued at nearly $50 billion left China in 2019. The exit of wealth via crypto showed the likelihood of investors evading capital transfer restrictions in China.",

    "content": "Ripple, a frontrunner in blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions, has joined forces with Onafriq, a leading payments fintech, to revolutionize digital asset-enabled cross-border payments connecting Africa with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the UK, and Australia.\nThe partnership marks a new era of efficiency for remittances and business payments across these regions, as Onafriq integrates Ripple's crypto-enabled payment technology to establish new payment corridors. This collaboration is set to address the longstanding hurdles in cross-border payments, such as high costs, slow transfer times, and reliability issues, thereby accelerating financial inclusion across the African continent.\nUtilizing Ripple's robust blockchain technology, Onafriq is poised to dismantle the barriers that have historically plagued cross-border financial transactions. The collaboration will connect PayAngel in the UK, Pyypl in the GCC, and Zazi Transfer in Australia with Onafriq's extensive pan-African network, encompassing 27 countries. This move is expected to vastly improve the speed and affordability of sending remittances and conducting business payments to Africa.\nOnafriq boasts the largest mobile money footprint across Africa, a continent where mobile money has been transformative in enhancing financial services access. The fintech's payment hub unites over 500 million mobile wallets across 40 countries, operating in more than 1300 payment corridors. This level of connectivity is pivotal for fostering regional payment interoperability and facilitating seamless cross-border transactions.\nThe announcement coincides with the appearance of Dare Okoudjou, Onafriq's Founder & CEO, at Swell Global 2023 in Dubai.

    "content": "Only1 Limited, a software development firm based in Hong Kong, has announced the launch of its web3.0 social platform dubbed ‘Only1.’\nThe web3.0 platform is designed with multiple features including a 360° social network with user profile, messenger, Superfan NFT, Creator Staking Pools, NFT marketplace, and NFT Launchpad, among others.\nIn this way, the platform is focusing on empowering creators to engage audiences and monetize their content in new ways that have never been seen before.\nMerged with the existing social network capabilities with blockchain, NFTs, DeFi, C2E (Create-to-Earn) and socialFi (Social finance) features, Only1 is set to revolutionize the relationship between creators and their fans by providing rewards and benefits to both creators and their fans at the same time through tokenization of social influence.\nLeon Lee, Founder & CEO at Only1, commented about the development: “We see a lot of friction in the current Web3.0 social landscape. Hence, the team has been working around the clock in modifying our Beta products to cater for the needs of a full-fledged journey for creators and users without switching apps and devices”.\nBuilt on the Solana blockchain, Only1 offers an accessible solution for users, especially Web2.0 creators who are faced with high gas fees to monetize their content and high entry barriers to the NFT marketplaces. It is the first one-stop platform on Solana for users to enjoy SocialFi features by creating content and engaging with other users to begin earning rewards.\n“By making it simple for creators to monetize content, Only1 opens up Web3.0 to new audiences and power the future of decentralized content and community ownership,” Leon further said.\nTo support creators through the entire Web3.0 journey, Only1’s all-round solution addresses each step in the process from the creation of their NFTs for a gated community to sales of their original contents in the digital economy. Creators are only expected to focus on creating high-quality content and building their gated community.\nBacked by Alameda Research, Solana Foundation and Animoca Brands, the web3 platform has already onboarded creators like Award-Winning Musician Hanjin Tan, Music Producer and DJ Dirty Audio and Social Video Creator Sarah Snow during its launch.\nThe company said that Only1’s Memberpass NFT will be ready next month for creators to build their gated community on the platform. More new features, including live streams and mobile apps, will be ready in the next few months, the firm stated.\nBridging the Gap Between Social Media and Decentralized Finance\nBeyond entertainment, the social media space has become a commercial playground for many users, especially content creators who can monetize their content across multiple platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and others.\nHowever, one disadvantage of the existing content commercialization model used by most social media platforms is that it is completely centralized. As a result, in most cases, creators’ payments are overburdened with excessive processing fees and charges, either from the main platforms or from intermediaries like banks and other payment networks.\nWith the launch, Only1 web3 platform is set to solve the issue of centralization in the social media landscape.\nOnly1, which is part of the second generation of blockchain-based social media platforms, offers a more scalable decentralized alternative for creators and users within the landscape.\nThe Web 3.0 internet service, which is based on blockchain and capable of hosting decentralized applications like Only1 social NFT platform, has the necessary underlying technology to fix most of the above-mentioned difficulties.",

    "content": "The Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), led by Representative Director Yuji Kano of bitFlyer, submitted a proposal for cryptocurrency tax reforms to the government on July 28, 2023. The JBA is advocating for a review of the current tax system, which they argue is hindering the growth of Web3 businesses in Japan. They are calling for a more conducive environment for citizens to hold and use cryptocurrencies.\nThe specific requests in the proposal are as follows:\n1. Abolish the year-end unrealized gain tax on tokens issued by third parties.\nIn June 2023, Japan's National Tax Agency revised some corporate tax rules, allowing companies to exempt market value evaluations of cryptocurrencies they issued themselves. However, the year-end unrealized gain tax on tokens issued by third parties continues to be a barrier for domestic companies entering new Web3 businesses. The JBA believes that abolishing this tax would significantly reduce barriers to entry into Web3 businesses and prevent token price drops caused by companies selling tokens to pay taxes.\n2. Change the taxation method for individual cryptocurrency transactions to separate declaration taxation and set a uniform tax rate of 20%.\nAccording to the latest statistics from the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), the number of cryptocurrency trading accounts in Japan continues to increase. As of April 2023, about 6.8 million accounts have been opened, surpassing the number of accounts (about 3.61 million) when the tax system for foreign exchange margin trading (FX) changed from comprehensive taxation to separate declaration taxation in June 2011. The JBA's survey results showed that 43.9% of respondents would like to double their investment if the tax system changes to separate declaration taxation.\n3. Abolish income tax on profits each time cryptocurrencies are exchanged.\nThe JBA expects that this will make operations more suitable for Web3 use cases such as DeFi and NFT markets, leading to an improvement in the convenience of cryptocurrencies.\nThe JBA hopes that by realizing these tax reform requests, Japan will be recognized as a leading Web3 country both domestically and internationally. They believe that the expansion of the new industry, the Web3 economy, will greatly contribute to the growth of the Japanese economy, which is facing transformation.\nThey also suggest that the increase in cryptocurrency users, investment amounts, profit realization, and proper declarations could contribute to tax revenue, limiting the impact on tax revenue reduction, and in some cases, could even increase tax revenue.",

    "summary": "With an evergrowing population, can blockchain aid in fighting against food shortages and supply chain problems?",
    "content": "Our population is growing, with data showing over 7 billion people living on Earth. This number is expected to grow further, reaching just under 10 billion in 2050.\nFollowing this expected growth, we must consider what technology, data, and information will need to be handled, making processes more efficient and sustainable to maintain our numbers.\nFeeding the planet\nConcerns over healthy and safe foods along with healthy living has been a growing change in our society, with documentaries, environmentalists, news reports and celebrities all getting involved. Pushing for a better and cleaner world, with healthy options for everyone. Streamlining the current system from farm to the kitchen will be a huge undertaking, as every item supply chain will need to be improved fighting against spoilage, disease, waste, and safety.\nSpoilage alone reduces the global food supply by a staggering third of the total supply, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Currently, the USDA aims to cut this food waste in half by 2030, but with a population increase from 7 billion to 10 billion, and 7 billion to 11.2 billion in 2100, this will need to improve further and with the population in mind.\nBlockchain alone is not a superpower, but technology that can track and ensure safety regulations are maintained from point A to B would be a giant step forward in creating timelines and supply chains that run efficiently to help aid spoilage around the world. More and better data can help us create better solutions.\nSharing information on how food is made, its story and the environment will help share and provide how we view the entire process. Understanding and respecting more about our planet and how farmers and fisheries raise and grow animals and other foods would open up awareness for animal cruelty, disease prevention, and spoilage problems.\nIf we can see exactly how the food industry works, where problems happen along the way and help monitor everything better, it can only help us improve the current system.\nOn a daily basis, we trust in the food we purchase to be safe and fair, ultimately, we trust in the people and businesses that manage food around the world from farming to transporting to shop window. Blockchain is all about taking away trust, making everything transparent and letting people take charge of their own information.\nForbes writer Raj Rao stated, \"In earlier, simpler times, people generally knew who was producing their food, milling their grain, making their cheese or cobbling their shoes. But globalization and international supply chains introduced anonymity and uncertainty to the process.\"",

The capital raise was led by Steven Cohen’s Point72 Ventures, marking the first time the billionaire will officially be getting involved in the Bitcoin (BTC) and digital currency ecosystem.\nAccording to a report by Forbes, Messari has won the hearts of the biggest names in the crypto ecosystem, including Blockchain.com’s Blockchain Ventures, New York-based Gemini’s Gemini Frontier Fund, Wyoming-based Kraken’s Kraken Ventures and Antigua-based FTX’s sister company, Alameda Capital. In addition to these new investors, Messari’s old backers, including Coinbase, also participated in the funding round.\nThere is a great affinity towards growth startups in the digital currency world today. This affinity has stirred the accumulation of funds to power firms with a unique business model and the right target market in the blockchain world. While there is often a willingness to fund a promising project, the SEC oversight border on the need to stir transparency amongst startups has largely held many firms bound. However, Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis say the firm has a workaround by being a part of the Big Four and JPMorgan in auditing and analysis provisions.\n“The defaults that many entrepreneurs and builders in the industry have is to be transparent and cooperative,” says Selkis, 37. “And try to be as helpful and communicative as possible with their communities. The problem is if you're a core developer or someone that was early in a project, and you're sharing certain sensitive information that even looks like it might be financial in nature. Then the SEC comes knocking on your door. It can create a tremendous amount of headaches.”\nThe success story of Messari and its ability to attract such investors as Steven Cohen centres on the firm's due diligence related to building transparency as required by the SEC. Besides Messari, the crypto ecosystem has been seeing several capital fundraisers recently, with NFT Marketplace, MakersPlace amongst those who managed to pull capital from investors.",

This will ensure a secure and traceable settlement of transactions. Carbonplace has been described as the \"SWIFT [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications] of carbon markets.\"\nRobert Begbie, CEO of NatWest Markets, commented on the news by citing research from McKinsey which showed that \"global demand for voluntary carbon credits is anticipated to expand by a factor of 15 in the next few years.\" He said that Carbonplace is in a unique position to address that need since the company offers scalable technology to organizations who are concerned about the environment.\nCarbonplace has already conducted test transactions with a number of different organizations, including Visa and Climate Impact X, ahead of the anticipated debut of the service later on in this year. Carbonplace employs its own distributed ledger technology to conduct offset transactions.

    "content": "Wikipedia is the largest online encyclopedia and one of the top 5 websites worldwide in terms of web traffic. While Wikipedia has been dominant in decades, the ecosystem of the encyclopedia is likely to be changed with the advent of blockchain. Everipedia is a wiki-based online encyclopedia which adopts EOS blockchain technology. Besides, a cryptocurrency token called “IQ” is used to encourage the content generation and censorship resistance in Everipedia.\nWikipedia Co-Founder Larry Sanger is happy to embrace the changes in the online encyclopedia with blockchain. Joined Everipedia as Chief Information Officer (CIO) Dec 2017, Larry shares to our readers why Everipedia is built on EOS instead of Ethereum! He also mentioned 4 advantages of blockchain on the encyclopedia, yet efficiencies are not the main advantage!\nAccording to Wikipedia, Everipedia is a wiki-based online encyclopedia launched in Jan 2015 as a fork of Wikipedia. As the chief information officer of Everipedia, is this role even more challenging than your co-founder role of Wikipedia?\nI'm not sure about the date. The first bits of code were done in late 2014, I'm told. I saw the first version of the site in the spring or summer of 2015, and it had recently come online then. By the way, I'm not a co-founder of Everipedia. I was an informal adviser starting in 2015. I became CIO officially in December of 2017, as a direct result of Everipedia's move to the blockchain.\nNo, Wikipedia was harder. With Wikipedia, I was the only person doing daily management of the site, and we had one assigned programmer. So almost everything was on me. When I joined Everipedia, there were already over a dozen full-timers and we've doubled that number by now. It's a very different ball game this time around. The Internet startup scene has changed a lot.\nWhy Everipedia chose to launch on the EOS blockchain instead of Ethereum? Will Everipedia be launched on other blockchain platforms in future?\nThere are several reasons to build on EOS. We thought EOS was especially well-built for utility tokens used in content production projects, like ours. Say what you will about it, but the EOS TPS is very high--that's what we'll need for frequent edits on an actively-edited wiki. As EOS has a proof-of-stake system, we incorporate staking in our current system as a quality check. The current Everipedia system is based roughly on another project by Dan Larimer, STEEM.\nYes, we have considered launching on other blockchain platforms, but then we've always said that—if EOS turns out to have been the wrong platform, we can make changes.\nAs an encyclopedia, what are the efficiencies that blockchain can bring to Everipedia as compared to Wikipedia?\nSure blockchain is efficient in lots of ways—theoretically, the more decentralized a system is, the less friction there is, so there are fewer people-based inefficiencies. But I don't think the main advantages of the Everipedia Network are its efficiencies per se.\nAs we've said many times, there are several big advantages to being on the blockchain:\n(1) It incentivizes the socially positive work of writing encyclopedia articles. People who wouldn't work for free on Wikipedia might consider working on Everipedia.\n(2) While this applies only to proof-of-stake blockchains, we have a basic layer of democratic oversight in that users must stake something of value (50 IQ most recently) which they could lose if other IQ token holders downvote their contributions. But this doesn't slow down the editing system; it happens after the edits go live on the wiki.\n(3) By being on the blockchain, we become a natural locus of not just an encyclopedia but of an encyclopedia network, what I like to call \"the encyclopedia layer of the Internet.\" Why should you have to contribute to Wikipedia if you want to contribute to the biggest encyclopedia in the world? All of the world's articles should be tracked, if not managed through, the Everipedia Network.\n(4) Similarly, being on the blockchain will make it easier to persuade people to rate competing articles, when we develop that system. An encyclopedia article rating system is a potentially very powerful, consequential thing, and rating encyclopedia articles takes a lot of work, so people will have to be persuaded that the project is not in the hands of any one organization. It needs to be governed by a neutral, impersonal, technical protocol. So that's what we're building.",

    "content": "Bitcoin mining difficulty has experienced a decline of 16%, which represents the largest percentage difficulty drop since Bitcoin miners started using the ASIC mining machines in late 2012, according to Glassnode data.\nThe Bitcoin Difficulty Estimator whose role involves providing updates every second, showed that the Bitcoin network adjusted its mining difficulty at 8:28 UTC on Nov. 3, and therefore placed the current Bitcoin mining difficulty at about 16 trillion, a decline from about 19 trillion, which represents about 16% drop. This phenomenon gives miners a reason to rejoice as their profitability is set to rise significantly.\nThe difficulty adjustments occur approximately every two weeks. Basically, Bitcoin mining difficulty shows how time-consuming and difficult it is to mine a new block for the Bitcoin blockchain. The difficulty decreases or increases over time, depending on the number of miners in the network.\nHowever, there are other explanations pointing out factors affecting the mining difficulty. For example, miners have professional experience in their work and therefore know how to respond to their mining activities.\nThe current difficulty decline is due to the reduction of the average total computing power racing in the network in the past two weeks as several Chinese miners have unplugged their machines to migrate from hydropower plants to fossil fuel power stations.\nJason Dane, a Bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics advisory and investment analysis company for the cryptocurrency markets, said:\nDane said that people might think that a major decline in mining difficulty shows a lack of confidence or a low price in Bitcoin. He, however, said that this is not the case based on the current negative adjustment seen yesterday. He mentioned: “This is purely a routine, annual event that just so happens to be in a bullish period for bitcoin, meaning that miners will do very well over the coming 14-day period.”\nBased on the time of writing this article, the next adjustment is likely to take place on Nov. 15, 2020.",

    "content": "Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain Plc on Monday raised a warning that it could be forced to shut down its business operations following a deal to raise $27 million from a strategic investor that failed to go through.\nArgo said earlier this month it signed a letter of intent to sell 87 million shares to the investor as it wanted to ease liquidity pressures. However, the London-based firm did not say why the fundraising agreement had been called off.\nThe Bitcoin miner said it is now working to secure other deals to provide working capital for the next 12 months. On Monday, Argo said it raised about $5.6 million by selling almost 4,000 new Bitmain mining machines and is considering other funding avenues.\n“Should Argo be unsuccessful in completing any further financing, Argo would become cash flow negative in the near term and would need to curtail or cease operations,” Argo said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange.\nThe shocking news sent the company's shares plunging as much as 72% and traded at £8.75 at 11 a.m. in London on Monday. Argo shares have dropped about 90% this year, as a fall in cryptocurrency prices impacted the mining sector.\nWhy Are Bitcoin Miners Struggling?\nThis year, the earnings of mining firms have plummeted by falling crypto prices and rising costs. Third-quarter earnings reports clearly showed the industry’s troubles, with major U.S. publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms recording more than $1 billion in combined losses.\nSeveral Bitcoin miners, who expanded operations in 2021 to capture more profits, are now struggling as the crypto’s values crashed.\nThe biggest cost historically for miners has been their energy source. As energy prices increased, while Bitcoin price plunged more than 70% from its record high last November, has left most miners finding themselves unprofitable.\nCrypto miners invested massively in new mining infrastructure to gain a share of huge profits. However, Bitcoin’s hashrate, which measures the total computational power used to secure the network, has been rising with more mining machines coming online. Based on its design, the Bitcoin network has been increasing its difficulty level, making it more difficult for miners to get rewards.\nThe increasing difficulty means that the mining industry’s total revenue is much lower compared to the previous year and the competition for this revenue also increased.\nLast week, Bitcoin miner Core Scientific raised the possibility of applying for bankruptcy protection in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Miner further revealed that it will not make its debt payments coming due in late October and early November. Blockchain.News reported the matter.\nIn September, crypto mining data center Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after reports emerged that it owed $500 million to more than 200 creditors.",

    "content": "A Texas resident named Joshua Thomas Argires has been charged by US authorities for using funds from a COVID-19 relief program to trade cryptocurrencies.\nThe criminal charge was announced by Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. Argires was taken into custody for fraudulently securing more than $1.1 million in a Payment Protection Program (PPP) which he invested in a cryptocurrency account.\nViolation of the CARES Act is a Crime\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a Federal law enacted on March 29. It was enacted to help Small Business Administrators (SBA) to access emergency financial assistance to combat the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One major source of relief the CARES Act provides is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding. These funds were approved to be digitally distributed to qualifying small businesses back in April.\nJoshua Argires is one of many US citizens that has been charged in recent times based on violations of the CARES Act. He claimed the funds through the companies Texas Barbecue and Houston Landscaping. According to the statement issued:\nFollowing these questionable allegations, Argires made his first appearance before the US Magistrate Judge Peter Bray on Monday.\nBlockchain Firms Also Benefited From COVID-19 Relief Funds\nBesides the role that blockchain technology is playing to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, blockchain inventions were also considered as a potential channel for the disbursement of the funds. In addition to these, blockchain firms (particularly Tron) also benefited from the US government COVID-19 relief funds as it was awarded $2 million.",

    "content": "The House of Representatives will vote for the first time on a bill that specifically aims to ensure the United States remains competitive with China in the race for blockchain and technological supremacy when it meets via webinar to discuss the American COMPETE act.\nThe American Competitiveness of a More Productive Emerging Tech Economy Act (American COMPETE Act) was introduced just last week Sept. 1 and will be discussed in the House Energy and Commerce Committee markup hearing today, Sep 9.\nThe bill has been expeditiously put before the House of Representatives and was sponsored by Congressman Bobby Rush (D-IL) and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) along with 12 other Co-Sponsor. The bill calls for the Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission to research and advance blockchain technology implementation and development in the United States.\nAs the China-US tech cold war heats up, the United States COMPETE act bill expands to the study of all disruptive and emerging technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and quantum computing.\nThe bill calls on the Commerce and Federal Trade Commission to make four key recommendations to Congress—how to accelerate the development of blockchain in the United States; to devise a national strategy to advance the US business sectors global position; advice on ways to secure the marketplace and supply chain of blockchain from foreign actors; and recommendations on legislation that could promote faster adoption of the blockchain technology.\nAs reported by Forbes on Sep 8, McMorris Rodgers highlighted it was critical to ‘Beat China’ through this strategy as they cannot compete with China at its own game of subsidizing its tech companies. She said:\nUS-China Blockchain Race\nAs reported by Blockchain.News on May 22, Lawmakers in the US have been coaxing the federal government to consider a national blockchain strategy for regulation and growth, citing China’s Blockchain Service Network as an example.\nChina, for all purposes, is currently leading the world in blockchain study, framework, and regulation. Highlights include the creation of a national blockchain strategy (BSN), pilot projects on digital currencies, and dedicating entire areas towards DLT research and development.\nChina's state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) has been rapidly advancing in 2020 and has already integrated with six public blockchains including Tezos, NEO, Nervos, EOS, IRISnet and Ethereum. By opening the national blockchain platform to allow developers around the world to experiment at a subsidized low cost, the United States could fall even further behind in the current tech cold war.\nThe United States COMPETE act aims to rapidly improve the American position in the race for blockchain dominance.",

Kazakhstan currently owns about 29 million hectares of forest, which is in constant threat of changes in land use, logging, and illicit forest fires.\nMeruyert Sarsembayeva, a financial mechanism expert at the Biodiversity Financing Initiative (BIOFIN), explained to reporters that a vast majority of the land remains excluded from the state's forest fund as only a portion of 29 million hectares is protected.\nSarsembayeva explained, “We will work with forests that are not being considered and managed. It is exactly these forests that are threatened by forest fires and illnesses. If they are not legitimized and transferred to the state forest fund, it may lead to that; they will produce even more emissions.”\nThe carbon reduction initiative between UNDP and BitFury falls within the umbrella of BIOFIN, as part of the UN's efforts to improve forest management practices through changes to legislation while increasing the level of public awareness about the reduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.",

Although the DeFi sector has attracted millions to billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies to the industry, some protocols have shown problems with their smart contracts.\nTaking a look at the issues with smart contract bugs, these bugs represent vulnerabilities on the protocol, which led to the Yam Finance project’s downfall last month. Yam Finance, a DeFi project saw its demise less than 48 hours after its launch. Yam Finance faced an error in its rebasing mechanism and was not fixed in time.\nYam Finance is one of the many protocols that exhibit issues with the lack of due diligence in the DeFi sector. The project was attractive to yield farmers from its start, as it was once of the first projects to launch high yielding liquidity pools last month. This attracted many yield farmers to the project, even though the team explained from the beginning that Yam Finance was of an experimental nature. The price of the YAM token fell from $167 to less than $1 in a few days.\nAs YAM’s value was obliterated, many people lost money due to the demise of the project. The market is currently swarming in the DeFi craze, and many market participants have not exercised precautions before investing in a project.\nCream Finance staking mechanism paused\nDeFi protocol Cream Finance has just faced an input error in its smart contract, and its staking mechanism has stopped working. Cream Finance’s token, CREAM’s price has been plunging and is down 25 percent in the past 24 hours. The token is down 67.8 percent in less than a week.\nThe Cream Finance team explained the technical difficulties the protocol is facing in its tweet, saying:\nCream Finance has been facing smart contract vulnerabilities, as the team explained that there were smart contract bugs found in the protocol. The team added that there was an extra “0” in the distribution contract, which caused the problem. Luckily, the team was able to stop the pool for migration, and all reward tokens are safe.",

    "summary": "BNB Smart Chain introduces BEP 336 upgrade, inspired by Ethereum's EIP 4844, to optimize data storage and reduce transaction costs, preparing for a network performance boost.",
    "content": "The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem is poised for a significant leap forward with the announcement of its upcoming major upgrade, BEP 336. This new development is set to revolutionize the way data is stored and processed on the blockchain, drawing inspiration from Ethereum's EIP 4844. The implementation of BEP 336 promises to reduce transaction costs and enhance network performance, marking a milestone in BSC's continuous evolution.\nBEP 336 introduces a novel concept known as \"Blob-Carrying Transactions\" (BlobTx), which are designed to handle large data chunks in a cost-effective and temporary memory segment, with each blob capable of carrying up to 128 KB. The primary advantage of this approach is the reduction in the necessity to individually verify each transaction within a block. Instead, the network verifies the accuracy of the data contained in the attached blob, simplifying the transaction verification process.\nThis upgrade is particularly beneficial for opBNB, the Layer 2 network that operates under the BNB ecosystem. opBNB relies on BSC for data storage while utilizing its security features. The temporary nature of blobs means they don't consume network space indefinitely, which translates to lower storage costs and, consequently, reduced gas fees for users.\nKey components of BEP 336 include a Blob Market, which introduces a fee market for blobs to regulate costs according to network demand, and a Precompile Contract, which further secures the network by verifying that blob data matches its transaction reference.\nBSC's unique architecture has necessitated the development of a bespoke strategy for blob propagation and persistence, distinguishing it from Ethereum's approach. Moreover, BSC will implement a dynamic gas pricing mechanism for blobs, with minimum and maximum thresholds to maintain reasonable transaction costs, a feature absent from Ethereum's implementation.\nThe phased rollout plan for BEP 336 begins with a testnet launch in April, allowing developers to assess and interact with the upgrade. This will be followed by a Magnet phase in May for continued testing and optimization, culminating in a Mainnet hard fork in June, marking the official deployment of BEP 336.\nThe anticipated benefits of this upgrade extend across the BSC ecosystem. Users can expect reduced gas fees and more efficient data management, which together ensure the blockchain remains bloat-free, enhancing overall network performance. These improvements make BSC more user-friendly and accessible, potentially attracting a wider audience, from experienced developers to newcomers to blockchain technology.\nLooking ahead, BNB Chain has a strategic vision for 2024, with a focus on enhancing scalability and user experience. \"Parallel EVM Re-Architecture\" is one such initiative aimed at significantly boosting transaction processing and scalability. BNB Chain is also developing opBNB further, with the \"Rollup as a Service\" (RaaS) initiative to support large-scale Dapps in developing customized L2 solutions, and implementing a \"path-based storage scheme\" (PBSS) to further optimize storage.\nIn conclusion, BEP 336 reflects BNB Chain's proactive and innovative approach to addressing the challenges of data management and transaction costs. The upgrade is a testament to BNB Chain's commitment to scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for a transformative period in the network's growth.",

    "content": "The revenues of Dunamu, the parent company of Upbit, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, dropped by an astounding 81% during the third quarter of 2023, according to the company's report. The performance of the corporation during the same quarter of the previous year stands in striking contrast to this dramatic fall made by the company. Dunamu had reported a net profit of 159.9 billion KRW (about $123 million) in the third quarter of 2022, but this number dropped to only 29.5 billion KRW (roughly $23 million) in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe recent decline in the cryptocurrency market is the primary cause of the financial performance of Dunamu, which has seen a large decline overall. It was admitted by the corporation that the falling pricing of digital assets, in conjunction with an investment climate that was typically slow, were important factors to this collapse. It is important to note that the issues that many organizations in the bitcoin industry had during this time period are reflected in this larger economic situation.\nDunamu continues to be dedicated to the blockchain and cryptocurrency field, despite the present bear market and the financial hardships that its investors have experienced. The organization is of the opinion that increasing the number of people who use blockchain services is essential in order to successfully navigate current challenging market circumstances. As a component of their long-term plan, there is a significant emphasis placed on reviving the blockchain ecosystem and enhancing the broader investment environment.\nAn further obstacle that Upbit, Dunamu's cryptocurrency exchange, had to contend with was a considerable rise in the number of attempts to hack the system. In comparison to the same time period in 2022, the number of hacking attempts that were made against Upbit increased by 117% during the first half of 2023. Nevertheless, it is significant that the platform has been able to prevent any big security breaches since the hacking incident that occurred in 2019 and included fifty million dollars that occurred.",

Auer writes that there is a necessity for regulators to establish auxiliary frameworks to govern distributed markets, however, DLT would ensure a more cost-effective and higher quality of compliance. He concludes, “Embedded supervision could further help maintain the confidentiality of firms and their customers, since cryptographic tools can be used to report an institution’s aggregated financial exposures to the supervisor without disclosing the underlying individual transactions.”",

The firm said the rise in Bitcoins mined during June is primarily because of an increase in total hashrate capacity and greater uptime at its Helios mining facility compared to May.\nThe firm stated that its mining revenue generated in June amounted to $4.35 million compared to $3.89 million in May.\nThis means that in the previous month, Argo's mining revenue increased by 10% to £3.38 million ($4.35 million) as the firm produced 46% more Bitcoin than in May because of higher uptime and increased hashrate.\nThe better performance was achieved as the firm shipped in and installed more S19J Pro machines from Bitmain, a commitment that keeps the Argo on track to install all 20,000 machines as agreed with Bitmain.\nPeter Wall, Argo CEO, talked about the development: \"Ongoing efforts to significantly upscale Argo's mining operations are reflected in this month's numbers and our increased hashrate,\" adding that \"These numbers, along with our continued installations of the S19J Pro machines, put us in a solid position with regards to our mining capacity. We believe the company is well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions and further increase our efficiencies.\"\nArgo mentioned it generated the profit at a time when Bitcoin and Bitcoin Equivalent Mining Margin stood at 50% during June, compared to May's 55%. The decrease in mining margin was majorly driven by the reduced Bitcoin prices and higher electricity costs at its Helios facility in Texas.\nAs of June 30, Argo said it held 1,953 Bitcoins, out of which 210 were BTC Equivalents.\nBesides that, the Bitcoin miner further disclosed that it hired an in-house derivative trader in June to help better navigate the extreme market conditions that have seen Bitcoin drastically plunge its price.\nArgo mentioned that it has been using derivatives to reduce downside risk since October last year. The firm said it hired a full-time in-house derivative trader last month to improve the company's capabilities within risks and treasury management.\nArgo also disclosed that it sold 637 BTC at an average price of $24,500 in June in order to pay for operating expenses and a BTC-backed loan from Galaxy Digital.\nAt the end of last month, Argo said it had an outstanding $22 million balance loan with Galaxy Digital. In December last year, Argo signed the $30 million loan collateralized by Bitcoin.\nArgo said that with the outstanding loan balance standing at $22 million, it is confident that it has adequate liquidity to avoid any potential liquidations of the BTC-backed loan in case Bitcoin prices continue dropping.",

    "content": "EzyStayz, an Australian-based international holiday rental platform, is using blockchain technology to minimize costs, as well as enhance the home rental services it offers.\nAccording to a press release, EzyStayz is gearingtowards being a significant player in this sector as it has been in operation for three years, and it has been able to attain at least 155,000 properties spread across 34,000 cities in 190 nations globally.\nNevertheless, the home rental sector has been engraved in duopoly tendencies because it is dominated by two large companies, namely Expedia and Airbnb, as they account for 72% of the market bookings. This has instigated a centralized system where customers' options are limited, prompting substandard holiday rental experience and dwindling profit margins for hosts.\nEzyStayz seeks to revamp this through blockchain as customers are presented with a multitude of peer-to-peer services absent in the present home rental market. The blockchain network adopted also uses a safe multi-signature digital wallet able to store various cryptocurrencies, and this makes instant payments inevitable.\nEzyStayz seeks a cheaper and transparent system\nEzyStayz has had the objective of incorporating technological innovations into its future operations. Part of the solutions has seen it incorporate blockchain into its services as this is deemed to optimize customer loyalty by offering them a safer, cheaper, and transparent avenue of planning vacations and travel holidays.\nEzyStayz is also leveraging on blockchain to create digital identities for its user base as this will be instrumental in eradicating intermediaries as customers can finish transactions through smart contracts and communicate directly.",

However, reports have said that the $1.8 trillion crypto sector has not completely accepted the requests from lawmakers.\nCrypto exchanges have turned a blind eye to orders for a cut off of all Russian users, which has given rise to concerns that Russia could use cryptocurrencies as a loophole to navigate around sanctions that have been put upon the country by the United States and Europe, according to a report by Blockchain.News.\nDavid Schwimmer, LSEG’s chief executive officer, said that crypto exchanges are stuck in between either abiding by the philosophy of independence from regulation or supporting the centralised system of global finance - which calls for the requirement of regulation and transparent frameworks.\nAnother report by Blockchain.News said that Russians with strong social connections, who are under international sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine, have been using cryptocurrencies to launder their wealth.\nCrypto watchdog firm Elliptic said that it found millions of crypto addresses connected to criminal activity and 400 digital asset providers who help users buy cryptocurrencies using rubles.\nAccording to Reuters, some crypto exchanges have rejected calls to cut off all Russian users, raising concerns that crypto could be used as a way to circumvent sanctions.\nOn the flip side, Ukraine has raised more than $100 million in cryptocurrencies after calling for help on social media for donations to aid their military and humanitarian needs in bitcoin and other digital tokens.\n“We at the FSB are monitoring the situation, the conflict situation relative to cryptos,” Patrick Armstrong, a member of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) secretariat, told a City & Financial conference in London.\nArmstrong said that the FSB - which groups financial regulators, central banks and finance ministry officials from the Group of 20 economies - is sharing the information it obtains among its members.\nThe European Union issued guidance on March 9 informing companies that sanctions on loans and credits include crypto assets to block potential sanctions loopholes.",

    "summary": "MoneyGram has partnered with Stellar Development Foundation to enable customers to make settlements in different fiat currencies including cryptocurrencies using USDC stablecoin.",
    "content": "MoneyGram International Inc has partnered with the Stellar blockchain network to enable instant money transfers using Circle’s USDC stablecoin.\nTraditional cross-border payments giant MoneyGram announced on Wednesday, October 6, that it is working with the Stellar Development Foundation to launch the new service.\nDenelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of the Stellar Development Foundation, talked about the development and said that MoneyGram’s network would integrate with the Stellar blockchain to enable cash payments and funding in multiple currencies such as Japanese yen, US dollar, and others, using USD coin (USDC) stablecoin governed by Circle.\nDixon mentioned that cash users would be able to access crypto services that have been out of reach in the past.\nThe firms have scheduled to launch the services in select markets by the end of this year, with further international rollout expected to happen in 2022.\nMeanwhile, Alex Holmes, Chairman and CEO of MoneyGram International, also talked about the partnership and stated: “We’re enabling consumers to bridge crypto assets and fiat currency.”\nMore than MoneyGram’s 150 million customers will be able to convert cash in and out using USDC stablecoin for instant ATMs or bank facilities at MoneyGram locations.\nWhile several banks have been wary of getting hands-on with cryptocurrencies, United Texas Bank will facilitate settlement between MoneyGram and Circle.\n“Texas has a fairly proactive stance on crypto, and the governor has made a few comments. United Texas Bank is an established bank here and very focused on the opportunities in the crypto space. Not every bank is willing to step into the crypto world, and I think it says a lot about how progressive that bank is trying to be,” Holmes noted.\nThe partnership is a blow to Ripple, the crypto payments network, whose longstanding relationship with MoneyGram ended after the US SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, stating that the company violated federal securities laws.\nHolmes stated that the collaboration with Stellar is completely a different relationship from the partnership that MoneyGram had with Ripple. Leaving out the question of whether Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP is a security or not in the perspective of law, he said that the vision that MoneyGram and Ripple were working on had certain limitations.\nHolmes revealed the challenges that Moneygram faced during its partnership with Ripple. He identified the first challenge involved MoneyGram trying to create an FX market in a different world, and it really required a lot more time to bring that to life and make it work. Holmes mentioned the other challenge – MoneyGram was trading XRP, which, unfortunately, became so volatile because of the legal issues facing the parent company Ripple Labs.\nRipple’s SEC Lawsuit Impacting Crypto Sector\nThe bad blood between the US SEC and Ripple started in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit claiming that Ripple Labs had violated securities laws by failing to register its XRP cryptocurrency as a security.\nDuring that time, Ripple used its XRP cryptocurrency as a vehicle to finance its core business of seamless cross-border transactions for financial institutions and had been doing so for seven years since it created the cryptocurrency in 2013.\nThe lawsuit has adversely affected Ripple and created more confusion to the already complex regulatory discussions over whether crypto-assets should be regarded as commodities or securities or something else.\nIf cryptocurrencies are securities, as defined by court precedent, then they must be regulated and approved by the SEC, which demands disclosures from various crypto firms.\nHowever, Ripple maintains that XRP is not a security and therefore does not need approval from the SEC. Ripple also argued that the SEC currently allows other crypto tokens like Ethereum and Bitcoin to be traded like commodities and therefore not required to register as security.\nHowever, the SEC argues that RiRipple’sase is different because the firm has been actively using XRP to fund its core business and essentially represents an investment in the company itself. The regulator, therefore, considers XRP as security and not a commodity and therefore falls under the SESEC’surisdiction under court precedent known as the Howey Test.",

This digital won experiment realizes various policy support and payment service experiments such as central bank digital currency (CBDC) interest payment and redemption, freezing and collection, and inter-country remittance.\nThe report also tested its CBDC to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nAs the first stage, BOK created a CBDC simulation environment based on distributed ledger technology in the cloud from August to December last year, tested basic functions such as CBDC manufacturing, issuance, distribution, and redemption, and completed the first stage experiment in January this year.\nThe Bank of Korea completed the second phase of its retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) simulation in late June and shared the results of the experiment on October 7.\nThe central bank highlighted the performance issues of blockchain technology. The Bank of Korea found that the overall performance of the Ethereum-based blockchain was insufficient, including the scaling solutions and privacy technologies tested.\nExperimental data show that a CBDC can process up to 2,000 transactions per second, however, the Bank of Korea said there are some limitations to processing transactions in real-time during peak hours. One of the tests simulated peak demand by sustaining 4,200 transactions per second (TPS) for 30 minutes. At this level of activity, users sometimes have to wait for up to a minute delay.\nChang Yong Rhee, governor of the central bank, said it might be better to use a standard centralized ledger database.\nIn addition to testing the possibility of CBDC's extended functions such as offline transactions, digital asset transactions, and policy support tasks, it also tested the application of new technologies such as \"zero-knowledge proof technology\" (ZKP) and distributed ledger expansion technology to strengthen personal information protection possibility.\nThe Bank of Korea announced that, even after the research project is completed, it will conduct additional experiments in collaboration with 4 banks and 15 institutions, including the Korea Institute of Financial Telecommunications and Clearing, to more closely examine the already established CBDC simulations System functionality and performance.\nAccording to the latest count, 109 countries are advocating for a CBDC. 11 countries have rolled out digital currencies across the board. The UAE is one of 14 countries where CBDCs have entered the pilot phase and are ready for launch.",

Moreover, the concern was mainly with mainstream economic infrastructures being in cessation if the participation of companies like Facebook partakes in crypto payments and electronic transfers.\nFSB’s primary concern relates to major tech companies whose large user groups may disintegrate banks, should they become leaders in the payments market. A report reads, “Where stored value payment products (e.g., mobile wallets) become prominent; a relatively large and potentially mobile pool of funds may be controlled outside the banking system (though often these funds are ultimately deposited with banks). Furthermore, the greater mobility of this pool of funds compared with the customer deposits may also reduce the stability of bank funding.”",

He described the upgrade of the super app wallet as “code complete”.\nHowever, Schulman did not confirm the timeline or roadmap of development to third party wallets. ” We’re working right now on transfers to third-party wallets, and we really want to make sure that we create a very seamless process for taxes and tax reporting.”\nAccording to the Cointelegraph report, the new crypto wallet will feature high yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, messaging capability, and crypto capabilities. “Each wallet would be unique, driven by advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities,” Schulman emphasised.\nMeanwhile, Schulman said the company is working on how to use smart contracts more efficiently and how to develop Defi applications as well.\nThe payment platform continues to expand its crypto-related business. Earlier this month, PayPal hired Jesse Spiro, a former Chainalysis head of policy and regulatory affairs, to lead the crypto division in PayPal.\nAround two weeks ago, PayPal also strengthened its crypto function and experience to its clients. The company has increased the limit of purchase of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets up to $10,000 weekly from $20,000, but also remove the annual purchase limit for qualified customers in the U.S, allowing to have more extensive accessibility on a crypto exchange.\nIn May, senior management also revealed that the company would enable their customers to withdraw their digital assets to third parties.",

    "summary": "Worldcoin introduces Personal Custody, enhancing user control over biometric data generated via iris-scanning orbs for secure ID verification.",
    "content": "Worldcoin (WLD), a blockchain-based identity platform known for its novel approach to user verification through iris scanning, has taken a significant step towards enhancing user privacy with the implementation of Personal Custody. This development comes as part of the project’s ongoing efforts to provide a user-centric and secure identification system.\nPersonal Custody is a feature that allows individuals to retain all personal data, including images, metadata, and derived data generated at the orb during World ID verification, directly on their devices. By doing so, users gain unprecedented control over their information, with the ability to manage its flow and usage before opting for deletion. This shift from the prior default deletion of data to personal custody is a response to privacy concerns and recommendations from experts in the field.\nThe implementation of Personal Custody requires a sophisticated multi-step process. It begins with the user's device generating a public-private key pair to encrypt the data, followed by the backend creating additional keys for double encryption. The orb captures the necessary images for verification, creates individual data packages, and encrypts them before transmitting them to the backend. After the encrypted data packages are downloaded to the user's device, they are deleted from the backend to ensure no residual data remains.\nThis approach not only places users in control but also introduces the possibility of using Face Authentication for high-security applications. Face Authentication allows users to confirm their identity locally on their device without transferring any data externally, thus promising a higher level of security and privacy.\nThe adoption of Personal Custody is emblematic of the platform's user-centric architecture, a core aspect of the Worldcoin Tech Tree. This architecture is designed to facilitate the separation and replacement of system components like orbs and uniqueness metrics, making it easier to evolve the protocol into an open, permissionless system governed by a broad user base.\nWhile the initiative marks a substantial move towards personal data sovereignty, it also implies that optional Data Custody will no longer be offered during orb visits. This change encourages users to educate themselves about Worldcoin and make informed choices regarding the sharing of their information to support the project's improvement.\nFor those interested in delving deeper into the technicalities of Worldcoin's privacy measures and system architecture, the Technical Implementation section of the Worldcoin protocol whitepaper provides detailed insights. The Worldcoin community is also actively engaged in discussions across various social platforms, such as Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord, YouTube, and LinkedIn, and interested individuals can stay updated by subscribing to the blog newsletter.\nIt is important to note that the availability of Worldcoin (WLD) tokens is subject to geographic, age, and other restrictions. While WLD tokens are not accessible in the United States and some other territories, the World ID and TFH’s World App remain available. Prospective users are advised to consult the Terms of Use and the Important User Information found on the Worldcoin website for further details on eligibility and risks.",

    "summary": "TON's Q4 2023 Developer Report reveals a 22.8% increase in its developer community, highlighting over 500% growth in active developers and significant advancements in blockchain technology and community engagement.",
    "content": "In recent times, the blockchain sector has observed a significant surge in developer activity, with The Open Network (TON) standing out prominently. The TON Developer Report for Q4 2023 has unveiled notable developments, showcasing the rapid expansion of its developer community and the increasing engagement across various facets of the network.\nGrowth Trajectory: A Look at the Numbers\nThe TON blockchain has witnessed an extraordinary increase in developer activity, especially noteworthy during a period marked by a bearish trend in the broader crypto market. The Q4 2023 report highlights a remarkable 22.8% rise in the number of TON developer community members on Telegram. This growth is part of a broader trend observed over the last year, where TON has seen its monthly active developers increase by over 500% since Q2 2022, as reported by the Ton Foundation. Such a surge is indicative of the growing interest and confidence in the TON blockchain's capabilities and potential.\nDriving Forces Behind the Surge\nSeveral factors contribute to this burgeoning interest. Firstly, TON's approach to organizing a variety of hackathons, challenges, meetups, and grant programs has fueled developer engagement. Events like the March DoraHacks and the Hack-a-TON have been pivotal in maintaining a high level of engagement within the community. Additionally, initiatives like TON Breakfasts and TON Hubs in the EU and Asia have played crucial roles in spreading awareness and strengthening local communities.\nEducational and Financial Support\nTON has ramped up its efforts in providing educational resources and documentation for developers. The launch of Awesome Lists, video courses, and improved documentation on docs.ton.org are steps towards making TON development more accessible to newcomers and seasoned developers alike. Moreover, the TON Grants program has been instrumental in funding diverse projects, distributing around $66,000 in Q2 to support 34 initiatives. These projects encompass a wide range of applications, from wallets and developer tools to DeFi protocols and NFT platforms.\nTechnical Appeal: Speed and Efficiency\nA key aspect attracting developers to TON is its exceptional transaction speeds, which reached over 55,000 transactions per second (TPS) during a stress test in Q2. This speed is achieved through sophisticated sharding techniques, allowing TON to handle the transaction loads required by large-scale commercial applications efficiently.\nCommunity and Ecosystem Development\nThe development of TON is not just limited to technical advancements. The project has successfully built a thriving global developer community, with over 9,000 members across various language communities. This international outreach is further supported by a diverse range of tools and platforms available on the TON blockchain, catering to various needs like crypto ads, testnet faucets, over-collateralized stablecoins, and cloud scanning services.\nAs the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, TON's growing developer base and expanding toolkit position it favorably for increased adoption and impact. The market capitalization of TONcoin has grown significantly, reflecting the network's potential and the developer community's trust. With continued support and collaboration within the ecosystem, TON is well-placed to drive mainstream blockchain adoption and innovation.",

The role will be focused on helping to “define and execute” the investment firm’s blockchain and DLT efforts, and the candidate must be able to identify new avenues of value pertaining to DLT and digital assets.\nGoldman Sachs Digital Assets Team Keeps Expanding\nAfter telling investors that Bitcoin was not worthy of investment back in May 2020, the leading global investment bank Goldman Sachs is now exploring avenues of development to potentially create its own cryptocurrency.\nAs reported by Blockchain.News, Goldman Sachs appointed Mathew McDermott as the worldwide head of digital assets to spearhead the realization of this dream on Aug 6.\nMcDermott brings to the table a wide array of experience in the financial markets, and he sees blockchain technology as a backbone of the future monetary system.\nHe noted:\nBlockchain could help streamline distinctive processes in the digital financial markets ecosystem like securitization, debt issuances, and loan origination.\nGoldman Sachs has been a notable trendsetter in the blockchain/crypto space as proponents have been following its footsteps. Therefore, it seeks to go a notch higher by launching its own digital token.\nMcDermott stipulated:\nMcDermott asserted that the financial sector necessitated notable revamping.

    "content": "Bitcoin fell to a three-month low as cryptocurrencies took a dip on Monday ahead of global monetary tightening concerns and amid regulatory concerns.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the largest digital token was at the cusp of the lowest level since 2020 to as much as 6.7% and was trading at $18,500 as of 7:10 am in London. While Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, shed up to 6.2%, struggling to hold the $1,300 mark.\nRegulatory concerns and monetary tightening are expected to stretch from Europe to the US this week, and investors globally have turned shy on risky assets.\nInvestors are preparing for volatility due to the major interest-rate hike, which is expected this week from the Federal Reserve to fight price pressures. Bloomberg reported that US equity futures were in the red and a dollar gauge pushed higher in signs of market caution.\nYet, long-term investors (3 to 5 years horizon) might have nothing to worry about as Bitcoin price will eventually surge as the macro environment stabilizes over the next couple of years.\nAlthough the Ethereum blockchain - which underpins the ether token - had a major upgrade last week called the Merge, the token's value has fallen amid some speculation that remarks last week from US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler implied the new structure could attract extra regulation. Trades around the upgrade also were unwound.\nThe Merge changes the way transactions are processed and cuts energy use. After completing the Merge, Ethereum shifted from a verification system called proof of work (PoW) to \"proof-of-stake\" (PoS).\nAccording to a report from Blockchain.News, The Merge may have caught Gensler's attention to categorize the second-largest cryptocurrency as a security.\nGensler commented about The Merge, talking about the Howey test, which is a test used by courts to determine if an asset is a security. He stated that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries that allow holders to “stake” their coins might have to pass that test.\nThe global crypto market cap dropped below the $1 trillion mark, as it is down over 4% in the last 24 hours at $974 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\nOver the last 4 months, Bitcoin has remained in a range between $18,000 and $25,000. It is unlikely that the largest cryptocurrency could move higher to about the $25,000 level in the short term or anytime soon. This is because of the Fed’s action. US Bond yields have been rising in anticipation of further Fed rate hikes, this is not good for Bitcoin.\n- With the assistance from Nicholas Otieno -",

    "summary": "A UK judge has ruled that Craig Wright, who claimed to have written the Bitcoin whitepaper, is not the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto.",
    "content": "The UK High Court judge has dismissed the claims made by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright that he is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The case, which has been one of the most controversial claims in the history of cryptocurrency, saw Judge James Mellor reach a conclusion that Wright did not, in fact, create the Bitcoin system.\nThe identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been a mystery since the inception of Bitcoin, with the whitepaper introducing the digital currency published under this pseudonym in 2008. The absence of a definitive identity behind Bitcoin has led to multiple claims over the years, but Craig Wright's assertions have been the most persistent. Wright has, on several occasions, asserted that he is the mind behind the whitepaper that laid the groundwork for the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies.\nJudge Mellor's ruling is expected to be detailed in a written statement, which will include the reasons behind the conclusion that Wright is not the creator of Bitcoin. This decision comes after a series of legal battles involving Wright, who has taken several individuals and entities to court over the denial of his claims. The legal proceedings have scrutinized evidence presented by Wright, but the scrutiny has not swayed the court's decisions in his favor.\nThe ruling has significant implications not just for Wright but also for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. It reaffirms the anonymous and decentralized nature of Bitcoin's origins, which many see as a core tenet of its philosophy. The decision also highlights the challenges involved in proving the identity of someone involved in the creation of a technology designed to be autonomous and without a central authority.\nLooking back, this is not the first time Wright has faced legal challenges in relation to his claims. The crypto community has been largely skeptical of Wright's assertions, which has led to a fractious relationship between him and other industry figures. Other cryptocurrency exchanges and developers have been fined or reprimanded by authorities for various reasons, but this case is unique due to its focus on the identity of Bitcoin's creator.\nThe broader implications of the ruling may open discussions on the legal recognition of digital identities and the proof required to substantiate claims in the highly speculative and technologically complex field of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it may influence future legal disputes where the identity of individuals behind key technological innovations is in question.\nThe court's decision is a reminder of the ongoing debates and legal complexities surrounding the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. As the industry continues to evolve, the legal framework and recognition of digital and anonymous contributions remain areas of considerable interest and dispute.\nAs the crypto community awaits the detailed written ruling from Judge Mellor, the case of Craig Wright versus the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto appears to have reached a significant milestone, with the court's dismissal of Wright's claims likely to resonate within the industry for some time.",

    "summary": "The clampdown on crypto mining from China has caused a shortage of space for the homeless mining machines.",
    "content": "The ongoing price upset in the global cryptocurrency industry is caused partly by the clampdown on Bitcoin mining and all other cryptocurrency-related activities from China.\nThe reduction in the engagement of miners has not only stopped the inflow of computing power into the Bitcoin network stirring a massive drop in the mining hashrate; it has notably made mining more profitable for existing and running miners.\nCrypto miners are selling off their hardware, while some migrate to new safe havens, particularly the United States and Kazakhstan. A problem persists, as reported by Bloomberg, and that is the unavailability of data centres to house the scores of mining machines leaving China. This has created a situation where miners are willing to pay above the normal premium to secure a spot in data centres.\n“People are paying an arm and a leg to find hosting right now,” said Christian Kaczmarczyk, a principal at venture capital firm Third Prime. “These miners from China are willing to pay 6, 7, 8, 9 cents to get in the game. They’ll pay whatever.”\nThe mining problem has shifted from the lack of supply of machines to the lack of enough data centres to house them. The offset caused and the ensuing drop in hashrate implies that for the same amount of work done by this time last year, as much as thrice, the reward can be received, but only for miners in regions whose activities have not been disrupted by regulations.\nPer the Bloomberg report, the efforts to build new data centres may stall, as there are no readily available materials to fast track the establishments.\n“Machines are no longer the bottleneck,” said Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares. “Hosting facilities are. You just can’t build a massive co-location data centre in a few months.”\nWith firms like Argo Blockchain securing a $20 million loan to build a new facility amidst other similar gestures from other firms, the likelihood of resolving the space shortage in the near term is at a low ebb.",

The Japanese corporate giant's chief executive officer said that among all potential candidates for Ripple’s move, notably Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, UK, and Japan, the latter was “the leading candidate” of choice for Ripple (XRP) operations if they were to leave the US.\nPer the briefing, Kitao indicated that SBI Holdings was already a Ripple investor, which may serve to justify why Japan would be a rightful choice for Ripple if it acts on its wishes to relocate. Other indications seem to imply that Japan is likely the first choice of Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, as they have both previously expressed their attitudes regarding Japan.\nSBI Holdings and Ripple - fintech partners\nThe two have made it publicly known that due to the lack of crypto regulatory clarity in the United States, they may be considering other countries for Ripple operations, as it will be more beneficial for XRP trades and cryptocurrency-related business in general. Garlinghouse previously said:\nRipple endorses MoneyTap\nThe positive sentiment towards Japan seems to be strengthening as recently, Ripple backed SBI Holdings by investing in its subsidiary, a payments firm called Money Tap. Per the official report released by the Japanese bank:\nIn explaining the functions of MoneyTap further, the report read:\nWith this Ripple-SBI Holdings partnership, Ripple-powered technology may be increasingly leveraged across payment services in Japan to provide a seamless transaction experience for Japanese clients. It was also disclosed that in the near future, new Japanese ATM software may be created and powered by MoneyTap, as a new feature.\nBlockchain-powered digital payments thrive amid COVID-19\nWith the enhanced integration of Ripple blockchain technology in Japan, distributed ledger technology adoption may be even more pronounced within the country. In fact, despite the global coronavirus pandemic, blockchain innovation and digital asset adoption have been on the rise, according to Ripple. Per its annual Blockchain in Payments report:\nThe report indicated that across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin American and the Asia Pacific regions, blockchain and cryptocurrency knowledge was recorded at “a whopping 82-94%.”\nRipple also noted through a previous survey that amid COVID-19, the digital payments industry had thrived and even subsequently accelerated in growth.

    "summary": "Goldman Sachs predicts a substantial increase in blockchain-based asset trading in the next 1-2 years, indicating a transformative shift in financial markets and growing interest in digital assets.",
    "content": "Goldman Sachs, a leading global investment banking firm, has projected a substantial surge in trading volumes of blockchain-based assets in the next one or two years, with significant market growth anticipated in three to five years, according to an interview with Reuters. This forecast, as revealed in a recent Reuters interview with Mathew McDermott, the bank's global head of digital assets, aligns with the growing interest in digital assets and blockchain technology observed across the financial sector.\nGoldman Sachs' enthusiasm for blockchain extends beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has already seen a 50% rise in value this quarter. McDermott emphasized the firm’s interest in developing digital assets that represent traditional assets such as bonds, marking a shift towards diversifying blockchain applications. This approach reflects a broader trend in the banking sector, where institutions are exploring the use of blockchain for asset trading beyond cryptocurrencies.\nThe adoption of blockchain technology is expected to revolutionize financial market operations. According to McDermott, blockchain could enhance operational and settlement efficiencies and contribute to the de-risking of financial markets. He suggested that blockchain implementation could lead to quicker and more precise transfers of collateral and liquidity between parties, a significant improvement over current financial market infrastructure.\nDespite these optimistic projections, McDermott acknowledged the challenges involved in fully integrating blockchain technology into the majority of financial markets. While there have been pilot projects for issuing blockchain-based versions of bonds, establishing routine issuance and a liquid secondary market remains a work in progress. Goldman Sachs' survey indicates that 16% of clients expect over 10% of the financial market to be tokenized in the next three to five years.\nGoldman Sachs is also focusing on cryptocurrency derivatives trading, a market expected to grow with the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. securities regulator. This move could attract new institutional investors to the asset class, further fueling the expansion of blockchain-based trading.\nGoldman Sachs' prediction of a significant uptick in blockchain asset trading volumes reflects a transformative shift in the financial markets. With a growing appetite for digital assets and blockchain technology's potential to streamline operations, the coming years could witness a radical change in how assets are traded globally.",

    "content": "The Bank of Korea (BoK), South Korea’s central bank and monetary issuer, has released its research on the use of digital currencies and blockchain technology for the banking industry.\nAs reported by local publication Chosun on May 19, the bank recognized the progress in state-backed digital currencies, popularly called CBDCs, and their benefits in the broader financial market.\nBoK’s “Overseas CDBC Progress” report analyzed 14 central banks working on digital currency projects, including major banks in Sweden, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan, among others. All analyzed banks were found to be either developing pilot projects or already testing digital currencies on a distributed system.\nThe report noted several aspects as reasons compelling a shift to digital currencies, such as faster and verifiable payment settlements, sharp declines in cash activity, and the advances in DLT-based systems.\nThe bank reported:\nThe bank noted central banks around for the world are looking towards digital currencies for two primary reasons; 1. Making large-scale payments more efficient, and 2. Increasing financial inclusivity in developing countries.\nBanks in Europe, the Caribbean islands, and China are focussed on building infrastructure and applications for local digital currency usage, such as those between individuals, vendors, and micro-businesses.\nFrance, Hong Kong, and Thailand have grander aspirations. Banks in these countries want to handle large sums for customers, such as remittances, import-export, shipping, and general trade.\nThe report noted China and Sweden are in advanced stages of development and have completed a “proof-of-concept,” with the next step being a pilot study. Meanwhile, the central bank of Bahamas has already shifted to a trial stage, with no issues published currently.\nFor use in its CBDC project, Bank of Korea will utilize “various” enterprise DLT platforms, such as R3 Coda and Hyperledger Fabric. Ethereum and Ripple, two blockchain projects famous for enterprise usage, were not mentioned or included in plans as of now.",

    "content": "According to the United Kingdom's financial watchdog, newly proposed advertising rules in the United Kingdom could potentially see executives of crypto firms facing up to two years in prison for failing to meet certain requirements around promotion. These executives would be in violation of the rules if they failed to meet any of the aforementioned requirements.\nThe United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a statement on February 6 in which it revealed that if the proposed \"financial promotions regime\" is approved by Parliament, then all crypto firms within the country as well as those located outside of it would be required to adhere to certain requirements when advertising their crypto services to customers in the United Kingdom.\nAccording to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), \"cryptoasset enterprises selling to UK customers, including those operating abroad, must be ready for this regime.\"\n\"Taking immediate action will assist guarantee that they can continue to lawfully advertise their products to customers in the United Kingdom.\" As a part of their preparations, we strongly advise businesses to get any and all guidance that may be required,\" the statement said.\nIf the FCA's proposed regulatory framework is implemented, companies dealing in cryptocurrencies would be required to get prior authorisation from the FCA before advertising their services, unless they qualified for an exemption under the Financial Promotion Order.\nAccording to the governing body, a \"cryptoasset firm\" in the United Kingdom may only advertise and sell its products and services to clients via one of the following four channels:\nAccording to the regulatory body, any marketing that is carried out outside of these channels would be in violation of the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 (FSMA), which has a criminal penalty of up to two years in jail for each offence.\n\"We will take tough action where we detect companies advertising cryptoassets to UK consumers in contravention of the rules of the financial promotions regime,\" the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated in a statement. \"We will take action against firms that promote cryptoassets to UK consumers.\"\nCompanies found to be in violation of the new regime risk having their websites taken down, receiving public warnings, and being subjected to further enforcement measures. In addition to the possibility of serving time in jail for its executives.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said that they would wait until \"necessary legislation\" is passed before publishing \"our final guidelines for crypto asset promotions.\" This might perhaps indicate that the financial promotions regime will undergo upgrades or adjustments in the future.\nAccording to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), \"Subject to any changes in circumstances, we plan to adopt a similar approach to crypto assets to that outlined in our new regulations, which will be in force from February 1 2023 for other high-risk investments.\"",

    "content": "The adoption of Bitcoin has become more significant at the city level in the United States. Fort Worth, a city in Texas State, announced Tuesday that it has become the first city to mine Bitcoin in the US.\nThe city, which is ranked the 12th largest and home to over 800,000 residents, said this initiative is a partnership with Texas Blockchain Council - a non-profit association made up of companies and individuals that work in Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, crypto and blockchain industries.\nIn its statement, the city government said initially it will utilise three S9 Bitcoin mining machines, placing them in its city hall for the mining operations, which are donated by Texas Blockchain Council. The government added that these facilities will be protected by a private network to “minimise security risk,” Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker hold the launching ceremony and said:\nParker believes the city would be positioning itself to be the “capital of Bitcoin mining of Texas”. The administration aims at becoming a leading hub for technology and innovation, according to the statement.\nYet, the process of Bitcoin mining is regarded as not environmental-friendly enough, as mining methods are usually based on Proof-of-Work (PoW), instead of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and PoW is considered more energy-intensive, requiring more energy input which could be harmful to the environment. The government said, “the city estimates each will consume the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner,” based on the number and type of machines being used, adding that the energy it uses for mining would be less: “the nominal amount of energy needed for the program is expected to be offset by the value of Bitcoin mined.” The programme would be evaluated after six months, according to the official information.\nMore enterprises are trying to put efforts into mining Bitcoin, for instance, U.S.-based energy operator ExxonMobil recently launched a pilot programme to conduct Bitcoin mining by converting excess energy through the production of natural gas.\nTexas itself is also becoming a Bitcoin-friendly State. More crypto services have been applied domestically. Last June, Texas state-chartered banks got permission from the state regulator to provide customer custody virtual currencies services.",

    "content": "Will Bitcoin Ever Get Widespread Adoption in the iGaming Industry?\nBitcoin is now over a decade old, although it has only been known and talked about among the general public for the last few years. During the Bitcoin boom of late 2017, we saw endless reports of the ever-growing value of the token and much speculation of how it would continue to rise to tremendously as time goes on.\nWe also heard a lot about how Bitcoin would become the future of money, and that it would soon have widespread adoption as a payment method for goods and services all around the world. Is there any truth to it, especially in the iGaming realm?\nAdoption of Bitcoin\nSome sectors were quicker to adopt the currency than others. Understandably, technology companies were some of the first to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Microsoft was one of these, allowing consumers to buy digital goods like apps, games, and videos from the Microsoft Store with a USD equivalent of Bitcoin.\nWikipedia too began accepting donations in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, announcing the move back in 2014 after it signed a deal with Coinbase.\nSome companies accepted Bitcoin for a limited time as part of a promotion. KFC in Canada sold a bucket of chicken with a “cryptocurrency theme” for a short period in 2018. Called “The Bitcoin Bucket”, this special promotion had to be ordered online and would be delivered to the customer for a $5 fee.\nNo other KFC chicken, anywhere else in the world can be purchased with a cryptocurrency and there’s no sign this promotion will be returning.\nApart from enthusiasts, time-limited promotions, and the odd exception, most businesses have stayed away from accepting cryptocurrencies. In almost all of the examples where companies have accepted cryptocurrencies, they have done so in a way that means they’re not exposed to the underlying risk of currency fluctuation.\nUsually, this translates into working with companies like Coinbase who will accept a cryptocurrency payment but pay the merchant in fiat currency.\nMore recently, companies like Starbucks and Whole Foods have begun accepting Bitcoin through the payment network Flexa. This works in the same way, with the retailer being paid in cash instead of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin in iGaming\nThere isn't much push for cryptocurrency adoption in the iGaming industry either, which may come as a surprise to some since it has always been an early adopter of new technologies. It was an early pioneer of online payment methods, online gaming, mobile apps, virtual reality gaming, and live-streamed games.\nYet, it’s been slow to adopt Bitcoin as a payment method, and among the bookmakers and online casinos that are listed on the oddschecker website, only a handful accept cryptocurrencies in any form.\nBarriers to Bitcoin Adoption\nOne of the biggest reasons for this crypto-timidity is that cryptocurrencies have greater levels of anonymity compared to traditional payment methods. This can make it harder for the casinos to adhere to the strict regulations and licensing terms imposed on them as most are required to complete “Know Your Customer” checks.\nThe risk of currency exposure is another barrier that holds iGaming back. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are significantly more volatile than traditional currencies like the dollar, euro, and pound.\nWhile currency fluctuations present an opportunity for iGaming companies to gain if the exchange rate between Bitcoin and the dollar moves in its favor, it also stands to lose if the opposite happens.\nMost companies don’t like this risk, and many use other financial instruments to mitigate it. For example, futures markets, which let parties set a price for a commodity or currency for a trade at a later date let businesses plan ahead without currency exposure.\nThe risk can be removed by using services like Coinbase though, so there’s likely a bigger factor at play.\nPerhaps this factor is a lack of consumer demand. According to a 2019 report by Kasperky, many consumers are still skeptical about cryptocurrencies, with 81% of consumers never using cryptocurrency to make a purchase.\nIt could simply be that online casinos and bookmakers don’t believe there is sufficient demand to warrant the investment in a system to accept Bitcoin. They could also be counting on the fact that consumers will simply use another payment method if cryptocurrency isn’t available.\nWhether this is a smart move or it will prove to be shortsighted is yet to be determined. There could be a significant opportunity for casino operators that do want to accept cryptocurrencies.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect the view of Blockchain.News. Investors should be well aware of the volatility of cryptocurrencies and conduct their own research before making investment decisions.",

After Tuktuk Finance made its debut on the popular local cryptocurrency exchange Bitkub Chain on Sunday morning, its native token received frantic praise from investors in just a few minutes and then sold off. The price rose to several hundred in an instant and then fell to only one dollar.\nAccording to the platform's official website, the total value of the agreement is currently locked at $16,171,688.92. The final transaction price of TUK tokens is $1.572, bringing the project's market value to $5.9 million.\nThis incident aroused anxiety and concern among regulators. This is the first official announcement regarding the SEC regulatory DeFi document.\nMeanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission made it clear that it will target the DeFi agreement for issuing tokens.\nDue to the appearance of decentralized blockchain technology, many decentralized financial services provides to the market, such as lending, payment, and decentralized exchanges. However, a relatively complete regulatory mechanism has not yet been formed, which will become a major problem that global regulatory agencies will face in the future.\nThe SEC from Thailand said:\nAkaradet Diawpanich, CEO of Merkle Capital and Chairman of Cryptomind Group Holdings, reminded investors that they need to well-prepared on risk management to protect their principal; and to find out more about the credibility of the platform, its development team, or venture capital firm who claims to be an investor for further information, or checking search engines and other sources.\nThe total locked value in the whole decentralized finance market is up to $64.48 billion, according to DeFi Pulse data.",

    "content": "In a recent meeting, China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission has emphasized the need for a systematic, legal, and source-based approach to combat overseas telecom network fraud and related criminal activities. The announcement was made on August 6, 2023, as reported by the Economic Daily.\nThe commission pointed out that fraud groups have been increasingly utilizing new technologies such as blockchain, metaverse, virtual currency, and AI intelligence to update their criminal tools, making them more concealed and deceptive.\nOverseas Telecom Fraud: A Growing Concern\nIn recent years, overseas telecom network fraud groups have been luring ordinary people into fraudulent activities under the guise of \"high-paying job recruitment.\" These activities have led to violent detention, human trafficking, and a series of dark industrial chains, causing significant harm to the safety of people's lives and property.\nThe diversity of fraudulent methods, the ruthlessness of coercion, and the enormity of the defrauded amounts have led to public outrage. The commission stressed the need to \"resolutely maintain the people's vital interests, firmly uphold social decency, and firmly uphold the authority of the rule of law.\"\nOrganized Crime Features\nThe overseas telecom network fraud groups are characterized by tight organization, clear division of labor, multi-industry support, industrial distribution, group operation, and refined division of labor. This has necessitated strengthening international law enforcement cooperation and joint efforts with relevant countries to eradicate fraud dens, rescue trapped individuals, and bring the criminal forces and their organizers to justice.\nUtilizing New Technologies for Fraud\nThe commission noted that fraud groups are leveraging blockchain, metaverse, virtual currency, and AI intelligence to constantly update their criminal tools, making them more concealed and confusing. This requires coordination between public security, finance, telecommunications, and internet departments to apply advanced technological means and fulfill regulatory responsibilities.\nEfforts are being made to compress online crime space from offline, organize concentrated investigations and disposals of high-risk telephone cards and bank cards related to fraud, clean up associated internet accounts, and smooth network reporting channels. Thorough investigations are being conducted into domestic criminal gangs colluding with overseas entities, with full efforts to cut off smuggling channels.\nThere are increasing crimes related to crypto, blockchain, NFT and Metaverse in China.\nOn July 18, 2023, Chinese authorities in Qingshui County, Shanxi Province, successfully cracked a money laundering case involving the cryptocurrency Tether (USDT). The operation led to the arrest of 21 suspects and the confiscation of cash and USDT worth over 1 million yuan.\nThe investigation revealed a complex network of individuals across four provinces and six cities, using USDT to launder money for cybercriminals. The criminal group helped settle payments of over 54.8 million USDT, equivalent to about 380 million yuan.\nIn December 2022 in Inner Mongolia, 63 suspects were arrested for laundering money with USDT, amounting to 12 billion yuan.\nPublic Awareness and Education\nThe public security and judicial departments are urged to further strengthen publicity and education to continuously enhance people's awareness and ability to identify and prevent telecom network fraud. Special attention is being paid to young people entering society, guiding them to be vigilant against opportunistic psychology and herd mentality, and to seek a solid footing in serving society.",

    "summary": "Scammers have been taking advantage of COVID-19 and the worldwide economic crisis revolving around it to retrieve personal information and phish data from Microsoft users.",
    "content": "Scammers have been taking advantage of the confusion caused by COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent worldwide economic crisis in order to retrieve sensitive information and phish personal data from Microsoft users.\nIt was reported by Corporate Vice President of Microsoft, Tom Burt, that Microsoft users from at least 62 countries around the world have been defrauded by cyber criminals phishing for sensitive data. The online hackers operated by sending COVID-19 labeled files to a victim’s email account, which were purposely marketed in a way that incited users to click on the malware. Following that, malicious web applications were then able to access the victims’ Microsoft Office 365 account.\nThis is known as a form of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack. It has become increasingly sophisticated and complex to prevent, as new software is constantly developing, and scammers have upgraded to more creative phishing schemes.\nLuckily, following a court order issued by the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Microsoft has finally been able to seize control of the key domains in the cyber criminals’ infrastructure, in an effort of putting an end to cyberattacks targeting their multinational tech company.\nFBI Internet Crime Reports\nWith cybercrime on the rise, the FBI’s 2019 Internet Crime Report indicated that BEC attacks figured among the most costly complaints, resulting in over $1.7 billion of financial damages. FBI also reported that from 2016-2019, businesses lost approximately $26 billion dollars due to fraudulent emails.\nAccording to Safepost, the use of decentralized technology in emails have yet to be fully utilized and a blockchain-based solution would solve the majority of problems that traditional email providers faced. A decentralized email solution would entail that messages would be stored in shared ledgers. In other words, no single authority would be able to dictate how your data was used.\nMonero Used in Cybercrime\nWith phishing attacks being increasingly common in the crypto world, virtual currencies, such as Zcash and Monero (XMR), are more and more favoured by scammers because of their privacy features. XMR stands at the top of the list for the most private cryptocurrencies on the market. Because it operates on blockchain technology and its network is obfuscated, Monero is a popular choice employed by cybercriminals in carrying out illicit cyber scams.",

    "summary": "Beginners’ Guide on BTC Futures Trading",
    "content": "Cryptocurrency is perhaps the most suitable asset for day trading. Not only because the markets are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but also for the relatively high volatility of the market. Take Bitcoin as an example, it fell by 50% in the past 7 days,. While the high volatility could result in massive liquidation, on the other hand, it presents traders with more juicy opportunities to make profits.\nAs Bitcoin drops to 30K, the market is anxiously waiting for Bitcoin to rebound. If you want to enter the market, follow the steps below to transition from beginner to advanced.\n1. Understand Futures Trading\nFutures trading is specially designed for traders to hedge loss and to profit from market volatility rather than be stuck simply stashing their coins. Traders can borrow leverage from exchanges to greatly enhance their buying power. Futures trading with leverage is extremely profitable during market sell-off, where large quantities of bitcoin are dumped into the market.\nFor instance, if you use 1 BTC and 100x leverage to short bitcoin at $12,000, when bitcoin drops to $11,000, you will earn ($12,000 – $11,000) * 100 BTC/$11,000 = 9.09 BTC.\nHowever, make sure you use stop losses to protect your positions from great volatility. Take profit is also a useful tool when you can’t monitor your positions as often as you like.\n2. Sign Up\nBexplus is a leading crypto trading platform operating across over 30 countries, which allows you to take advantage of both the ups and downs of the markets. Bexplus is famous for its beginner-friendly interface and help desk.\nBexplus requires no KYC so you only need to open an account with an Email address, in just 1 minute. Once registration is complete, a trading account and a demo account with 10 BTC are opened automatically.\n3.Risk-Free Trading: A Demo Account\nSuccessful traders are those who learn to analyze the market and could always keep a clear head. When trading, traders often find themselves being controlled by emotions either because the prospect of losing money is too scary, or because the possibilities of earning more by stacking more investment is too tempting. The best way to improve your skills and mindset is by practicing in the free demo account.\nEvery user is given 10 BTC at the beginning and they are replenishable, so you can try out different strategies as much as you like.\n4. Make A Deposit And Claim Bonuses\nNo deposit fee is needed. You can start your deposit at 0.001 BTC. Bexplus supports Bitcoin, ETH, and 11 other cryptocurrency deposits, as well as USD, EUR, and GBP deposits. With one Visa Card, you can start your journey of accumulating bitcoin.\nTo enhance traders’ profitability, Bexplus offers a 100% deposit bonus to every trader. Deposit 1 BTC and you will get 2 BTC, and up to 10 BTC is available for each deposit. The bonus is not withdrawable but could be used as margin.\n5. Earn Passive Income With Bexplus\nWhen you are not trading, you can transfer your BTC to the interest-bearing wallet and enjoy up to 21% annualized interest.\nThe interest is calculated daily and the revenue of the deposit will be settled monthly. The monthly interest is calculated as (S*I/365*21)=MI. S represents the sum of the deposit, I stands for interest, and MI is the monthly interest.\nIf you deposit 10 BTC in your wallet, the monthly interest you would receive is (10*21%/365*30)=0.24 BTC. While most lending platforms require traders to deposit at least 1 BTC, traders can make a deposit starting from 0.05 BTC on Bexplus.\nBexplus platform has everything you need in becoming a successful trader, from educational materials to your own account manager. If you want to ride with the bull run, don't hesitate to join Bexplus now.\nAdvantages of Bexplus\nJoin Bexplus to get a double bonus and become a senior trader!",

    "summary": "Dr Ben Goertzel is the founder and CEO of SingularityNET a blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence marketplace project. He has described the project as a medium for the creation and the emergence of the global super brain–an autonomous decentralized democratically governed artificial super intelligent network that must be biased toward compassion for the betterment of humanity.",
    "content": "Dr. Ben Goertzel is the founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a decentralized blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) marketplace project. He has described the project as a medium for the creation and the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as well as a way to roll out superior AI-as-a-service to every vertical market and enable everyone in the world to contribute to and benefit from AI.\nBlockchain.News managed to catch up with Dr. Goertzel at the Blockshow 2019, in Singapore. In the first part of our interview, we discuss the evolution and the philosophical aspects of AI and AGI.\nEvolution of Artificial Intelligence\nFor many, the concept of machines with the ability to learn and develop as humans, but with the enhanced calculation speed of a computer, is simply terrifying. Will the machines replace us, will we be able to contain them, or will we merge with them and how far away is this future?\nWhile AI does describe the simulation of human intelligence by machines, most AI we encounter in our day to day lives are complex mathematical algorithms, such as Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, described as ‘narrow AI’ and are of relatively weak intelligence—capable of performing basic tasks but only within a very specific framework.\nGoertzel is aiming higher, essentially trying to birth a much stronger type of AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems with assimilated human learning cognitive abilities. He explained, “AGI refers to an AI that can generalize way beyond what it has been taught and has seen, which means it can imaginatively guess elements about new domains of experience. This is extremely important in the modern world where we are forced to deal with unexpected circumstances all the time.”\nBeyond AGI is where things get really exciting and may perhaps present a slightly existential challenge for humanity—artificial superintelligence (ASI). Goertzel said, “Artificial superintelligence is the next step beyond general intelligence. Humans currently have more general intelligence than the software products that are commercially available right now. But humans are by no means the most generally intelligent possible system. I think as AI advances further and further, you're going to see AI as tremendously smarter than people much as we're much smarter than monkeys, rats, or bugs. But I mean, to get from where we are now with narrow AI, to AGI, and then to artificial superintelligence, we need to go through quite a series of practical steps.” He continued, “That's really what we're engaged with at SingularityNET—the project is how to get through the next steps of the evolution—from where we are now, with fairly simplistic narrow AI towards a powerful general intelligence but also taking care to do it in a way that avoids putting the AI in control of these confused centralized global powerful parties—we want a decentralized general intelligence.\"\nThe Singularity in SingularityNET\nAs Dr. Goertzel revealed, “The singularity in SingularityNET refers to the future foreseen by Verner Vinge and popularized by Ray Kurzweil—it basically is the moment at which technology starts advancing so fast, it seems effectively instantaneous to the human mind, and this is going to occur by AGI becoming smarter than people. AI will be doing the invention rather than people.”\nShortly before his death, at a conference in Lisbon, Stephen Hawking warned those in attendance that the development of artificial intelligence might become the “worst event in the history of our civilization.” He was alluding to what is known as the ‘technological singularity.’ Other notable intellectuals of our time including Tesla’s Elon Musk and neuroscientist Sam Harris have also delivered a number of foreboding speeches regarding the innovation, believing it may be the start of our impending doom and will ultimately replace us completely or even worse—simply discard us in the course of an intermediary task as HAL 9000 discarded the lives of the astronauts in favor of completing the mission of the Discovery One.\nGoertzel does not share this apocalyptic view but sees an opportunity for humans and machines to evolve together, he said, “AI will almost certainly become far more intelligent than human beings. But there will be a possibility for humans to follow the AI along and effectively fuse their minds with the AI—which Elon Musk, among others, are also working on with his company Neuralink. I would say humans who choose not to fuse with the AI will indeed be, in a sense, left behind as they will no longer be among the smartest beings in this region of the universe.”\nArtificial Compassion for Humanity\nThe fact that AI will become much smarter than people do not necessarily mean that AI is a danger to humans. Goertzel explained, “That all depends on how they are built, what we want is AIs that are compassionately disposed toward human beings. That is also why at SingularityNET we're so focused on creating a democratically controlled AI mind because if the first true general intelligence is controlled by a military organization or an advertising agency, then this probably isn't optimal in terms of gathering a beneficial general intelligence to emerge into a compassionate, supermind.”\nSo how do you put compassion into a machine? How can you teach an AI about empathy and concepts as abstract as love? The reality is that even as humans, we are unable to display or enact these concepts with any real consistency. Goertzel said, “You don’t program empathy into the code of the AI; these things will be learned by the AI. Compassion will emerge within the AI in the course of its interactions with the world—including the humans in the world and the physical world. It’s very similar to a child, you don’t program emotions or compassion into a child; they gain it through interactions with the world.” He added, “So the task of AI is to build a learning system and a self-organizing system that can organize its own mind; its own feelings; and its own compassion in an appropriate way. It is complex, but the internet is complex, your mobile phone is complex, your laptop is complex, I mean, humanity has built many complex things, and these are built by a combination of many complex people working together.”\nAt the comparison of an AI developing as a child would, I could not help but consider the amount of children that grow up to be sociopathic—often making impulsive decisions or breaking rules with little or no feelings of guilt or wrongdoing. Goertzel admits, “Humanity is certainly a complex mess with aspects that are both positive and negative according to the value systems of various parts of humanity. I think the best we can do is put an AI out there in the world and expose it to the various aspects of humanity and make sure that it's biased in a positive direction.”\nGoertzel himself is a father of four children and a grandfather to one, speaking from experience he said, “Protecting them from all the bad things in the world is something you can only do to a limited extent because eventually, they're going to go out there and interact with some harsh realities—but you can bias what you expose them to in a positive direction.”\nThe reality of our future according to Goertzel, is that AGI is coming regardless and what we can do is ensure that it is not solely disposed towards the whims of a powerful central authority and that it is taught compassion for humanity. He said, “AI will be used for military purposes, it will be used for advertising and even crime. We have to make sure that AI is also used, and to a greater extent, for education, agriculture, healthcare or scientific discovery. The AI will get all these things integrated into its mind and be able to form a whole picture of human values and culture to form a substantial inclination towards compassion.”\nSum of Many\nGoertzel clarified that the creation of the future AGI global intelligence will not be done solely by his team at SingularityNET, it will be the combined work of a vast community of AI and technology developers as well as the information that the AI agents on the network are able to absorb from human consumers who leverage the network.\nHe said, “If Singularity is going to play a key role, then we need to be massively growing the user base of SingularityNET—we have to drive massive adoption of these decentralized networks that we have launched. After two years of work, we have a pretty nice version of the SingularityNET platform out there. It's a decentralized network which is democratically governed and controlled—meaning the AI network is sort of controlled by the AI agents in the network, rather than by some outside party. It's a nice bit of software and we’ve shown it works.” Concluding he said, “If humanity wants to transition from AI to AGI and then to super intelligence in a democratic and participatory way then networks like SingularityNET need to be a significant part of the mix, which is easy to see from an abstract view but from practice on the ground, there's still a lot to be done to get adoption of this sort of platform.”",

The attackers dumped HNT tokens that did not belong to them into the market, causing huge downward pressure on the price.\"\nFounded in 2013, the Helium Network's ever-expanding network of hotspots enables anyone to own and operate a wireless network of low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices, while customers can build and participate by using a cryptographic token called the HNT award network for profit.\nThe HNT native token is a reward paid by Helium to hotspot hosts, while the MOBILE tokust launched last month, is a reward paid to Helium 5G hotspot infrastructure operators. Currently, there is a lack of liquidity in the market for MOBILE tokens.",

    "content": "The price of Bitcoin hit the level of $46,000, which has put the world’s top cryptocurrency back on track to positive territory for the year, according to Bloomberg.\nBitcoin touched $47,583 during intraday in the Asia trading session, which was above the $35,000 to $45,000 range where it has been stuck since early January.\nBloomberg said that “with the fresh gains, Bitcoin is now up about 1.2% for the year, compared with a 4.7% decline for the S&P 500.”\nThe Federal Reserve and other central banks have removed some of the stimulus measures around Bitcoin in response to the pandemic downturn, and it has led the coin to remain in a tight path, Bloomberg said, which means that there is less cash to go towards riskier assets.\nDigital currencies have also come under scrutiny recently, with speculation swirling that they could be used to avoid Russian sanctions.\nHowever, Bitcoin and other tokens such as Ether began a steady uptrend this month alongside broader increases in U.S. stocks, but it took until the last day for Bitcoin to take out $45,000 convincingly.\n“As we test the top of the 2022 trading range for the fifth time, this is another one of these Bitcoin moments when the narrative could swiftly change, and investors pile in, propelling the Bitcoin price higher,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at Nexo. “It might just be time to awaken from the Bitcoin-sideways slumber that’s been 2022.”\nBitcoin’s status has been tested by altcoins like Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and Dogecoin over the past few days.\nCardano has jumped 30% over the past five days.\nAccording to Bespoke Investment Group, Bitcoin was well above its 50-day moving average, which currently sits around $41,085. That puts it around the 80th to 90th percentile and in the “overbought” range.",

    "content": "US Federal Judge P. Kevin Castel has denied Telegram’s request to issue its Gram tokens to overseas investors.\nTelegram had filed an appeal to last week’s ruling by a United Stated federal court in favour of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is prohibiting the issuance of Gram tokens for the time being.\nIn the most recent turn in Telegram’s six-month court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the legal status of the former’s $1.7 billion Gram token offering in 2018, the US courts have ruled that the injunction barring Telegram from issuing its Gram tokens is applicable to all potential investors both in the United State and overseas.\nCourts Continue to Side with SEC\nIn Telegram’s notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the company cited the SEC’s lack of jurisdiction with overseas investors and even made the suggestion that it would implement safe-guards to protect against “non-US Private Placement purchasers reselling Grams to US purchasers in the future.”\nJudge Castel argued that Telegram had not provided enough evidence that it could implement these types of safeguards and cited that, “the TON Blockchain was designed and is intended to grant anonymity to those who purchase or sell Grams,” meaning that the proposed safeguard would be unenforceable in the real-world.\nThe order also points out that the question of the SEC’s jurisdiction has not been previously raised by Telegram, and said at this point it is too late to consider it.\nWill TCF Launch TON without Telegram?\nAs the picture is starting to look very grim for the launch of the Telegram Open Network (TON), some in the TON Community Foundation came forward with contingency alternatives on March 26: notably their ability to launch with or without the messaging platform’s further participation and without regulator approval.\nAs the US Courts appear to be siding with regulators, granting a temporary halt on Gram distribution; the TON Community Foundation’s founder, Fedor Skuratov said that the community is seriously considering options like launching the network without Telegram.\nSkuratov said “Strictly speaking, no additional measures are required to launch TON by the community, except for a consensus within the community. But in order to get recognized, we will need to come to an agreement with investors (at least, with a majority of them).\"\nSkuratov highlighted that all the code necessary to launch TON is available online as it was published as open-source by Telegram. He explained that they would merely need to create the genesis block and could run the network on a minimum of 13 validators.\nWhile the US Securities and Exchange Commission may have temporarily succeeded in stopping the launch of Telegram’s TON network, can they really stop open-source technology?",

    "content": "Facebook’s Libra drew fire as Senator Sherrod Brown likened it to the 2008 subprime mortgage fiasco.\nYahoo Finance has conveyed Senator Brown’s fierce sentiments about Libra as he recalled bankers proposed the innovative product that they deemed to be a game-changer. This would, however, not be the scenario as subprime mortgages instigated a turmoil.\nThe senator likened Facebook's Libra to subprime mortgages and projected that the pitch of assisting the underbanked and unbanked would similarly turn up a hoax.\nWithout a doubt, subprime mortgages were disastrous as millions of families lost their homes. As a result, the economy was wrecked and the nation’s “inequality” rose at an alarming rate. Brown projects that Libra will take a similar trajectory.\nLibra’s escalating pressure\nBrown stipulates that Facebook through Libra seeks to become the biggest bank globally. This is risky without proper regulations.\nNotably, Facebook has a user base of nearly a third of the globe’s population. As a result, if they were to utilize Libra, the present financial systems would be disrupted.\nPressure against Libra has been rising at an alarming rate. Specifically, different regulatory bodies have put up stringent measures.\nFacebook wavers\nAt the beginning of this week, Facebook gave hints that the Libra project was facing considerable constraints. As a result, it could not be launched.\nTherefore, the company has backtracked on earlier authoritative declarations of being the largest bank globally.\nAdditionally, prevailing data privacy outrages linked to Facebook have also escalated the pressure against Libra. Facebook’s present and proposed financial services have been blocked in China and India.\nMoreover, different countries have depicted significant concerns about Libra. Specifically, pressure has been rising against Facebook’s Libra project and this may jeopardize its existence.\nThere is no assurance Libra will be considered in a positive light as the firm has never made any significant investments in virtual currencies or blockchain.\nFacebook's Libra 'endangers' America\nLate in July 2019, a survey conducted on market sentiments for Libra suggested that the currency’s adoption rate is paltry.\nFacebook still expresses its willingness to address any concerns over the coin, mentioning that the reason for the early announcement of the launch was to accommodate requests and concerns raised by the US regulators.\nThe news comes as a major let-down for many cryptocurrency fans as Libra was believed to be the torch-bearer of significant crypto advancements in the years to come. For now, the uncertainty over its launching remains with the comment by Senator Brown thrown in.\nBrown’s comments echo those made by Republican crypto adversary Brad Sherman, who said Libra could ‘do more to endanger America than 9/11’ at a congressional hearing.\nWhat do you think could be the true motivation for launching Libra?

It said that the resumption of withdrawals is targeted for June 30 and will depend on the demand for the new tokens.\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Mark Lamb, chief executive officer of CoinFlex, said, \"we've spoken to a significant amount of private investors such that we think that at least half of the issuance is going to be subscribed for.\"\nCurrently, the token sale is eligible only to non-US sophisticated investors, according to CoinFlex.\nLast week, the company halted withdrawals following an unnamed counterpart's inability to repay debt after experiencing liquidity issues. CoinFelx shared that the user was a high-net-worth individual with \"substantial shareholdings in several unicorn private companies and a large portfolio.\"\n\"During the recent market volatility, a long-time customer of CoinFLEX's account went into negative equity, meaning the individual's account currently holds a negative balance. In response, CoinFLEX made the decision to halt user withdrawals starting from June 23, 2022, \"CoinFlex said in a blog post.\nThe individual had consistently met every margin call before this incident, CoinFlex said in its blog post. It further added that this incident indicates that crypto markets may move too sharply for manual margin arrangements to be effective.\nCoinFlex further reiterated in its blog post that the individual's a \"high-integrity person of significant means, experiencing temporary liquidity issues due to a credit (and price) crunch in crypto markets (and non-crypto markets).\" The cryptocurrency exchange platform was founded in 2019. The company is a smaller crypto exchange focusing on derivatives trading.\nCoinFlex's halt in withdrawals has come at a time when the crypto industry has been experiencing liquidity problems and contagion.\nOther companies such as Celsius Network and Babel Finance have also halted withdrawals indefinitely. While crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital is also facing liquidity troubles that rattled investors, according to Bloomberg.\nCoinFlex also announced that it is working on building a new model for transparency around futures margining after the restoration of withdrawals and also as a direct response to this incident.\n\"The notional (USD) value of every account's futures positions will be made publicly available via an external auditing firm that will attest to these futures positions every hour. We will also make available the margin (collateral) backing these positions in USD value and break down the collateral by type 1 (stablecoins), type 2 (highly liquid coins), and type 3 (low liquidity coins), \"CoinFlex said.\nEven though the publicity of users' futures position comes at the expense of privacy, CoinFlex said that the data will provide users with insights into the platform's riskiness. It will show how leveraged the users are and whether any liquidations occur at a loss to the platform.",

    "content": "Asia's leading digital asset exchange ZipmexX has suspended users' cryptocurrency withdrawals, citing the move as the exchange's assets could be swallowed up by the financial crisis facing the Celsius Network and cryptocurrency lender Babel Finance.\nThe company revealed that it had lent $48 million to Babel Finance and $5 million to Celsius, which filed for bankruptcy protection. To resolve the liquidity crisis, the company is working with both companies and actively negotiating a potential bailout with investors.\nOn Thursday, Zipmex's official statement reads:\nZipmex cited \"volatile market conditions and the resulting financial difficulties for our key business partners\" as the reason for its decision.\nFounded in 2018 by Marcus Lim and Akalarp Yimwilai, Zipmex started operations in September 2019 and is headquartered in Singapore and Thailand.\nThe company’s native ZMT token has fallen more than 90% from its all-time high. The current price was trading at $0.3815, up over 15% during the intraday.\nPreviously, Babel Finance, a cryptocurrency lending firm based in Hong Kong, announced that it had temporarily paused the withdrawals and redemption of crypto assets. The move comes as the crypto lender appears struggling to pay its customers after the recent plunge in the cryptocurrency market.\nOn June 13, cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network suspended all withdrawals and transfers from customers as the company faced fears of insolvency and bankruptcy.\nThe co-founder of cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, Bobby Ong, said that: “Zipmex is part of the crypto contagion fallout, and the insolvency of their counterparty has caused Zipmex not to be able to honour its obligation to its depositors.”",

The system fosters trust on both sides of the transaction, leading to fairer payments for farmers and piece of mind for consumers.\nBenefits of a Blockchain Ecosystem\nLeveraging blockchain technology, registered Haitian farmers are provided with a unique digital identification number, which makes the farmers key players in the supply chain, and gives them access to financial services, logistics, insurance and other services.\nThe farmers are also able to tokenize their products using Agriledger’s service, further enhancing their access to peer-to-peer dealings.\nBlockchain features make the data on the platform inherently trustworthy, enhance the overall traceability and transparency of the supply chain and automates data reconciliation.The system, which includes a digital wallet for fast network payments, makes it is easier for farmers to get loans and access financial services.\nAgriledger has announced plans to create a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) enabled marketplace. The planned service would include communications and an order management platform to ease transactions between food suppliers and retailers.\nHaitians are also Trading Waste for Digital Tokens\nWhile tokenizing can provide Haitian farmers with enhanced access to peer-to-peer finance, it is also being implemented in Haiti to encourage people to incorporate more environmentally friendly measures. The initiative offers tokenized compensation for disposing of waste in the right manner.\nAs reported by Blockchain.News, a Canadian company called Plastic Bank in operation in Haiti and Peru utilizes a blockchain solution to reduce the ecological damage caused by plastic waste.\nThe company has strategically located recycling centers where people take their waste, such as empty plastic water bottles, cups, and bags in exchange for digital tokens secured via a blockchain platform and can be redeemed for food or charging phones. All the plastic collected is then sold to a buyer for recycling purposes.",

Therefore, it cannot be regulated by any financial sector regulator.

    "title": "What are Smart Contracts and Why are They Important?",
    "summary": "Since the lack of transparency puts the security of any transaction in jeopardy, this as now a problem of grave concern, so how do smart contracts solve these problems?",
    "content": "The purpose of all contracts in its rudimentary sense is to enforce commitment, and it is ingrained in the principle “pacta sunt servanda,” which translates to \"agreements must be kept.\"\nWhat necessitated the need for contracts\nThe idea of contracts was conceived in the 1750s during the industrial revolution. At this time, the increase in business and merchant trade was exponentially high, leading to a need for people to look for better ways to enforce their business agreements because the standard means of making agreements, which was by consensus, was losing its effectiveness. In England, contract law was created; this was a system of law designed to be a reference by which business agreements were made and enforced.\nTransparency to know the rules governing the contract, access to what information is the other party of the contract has in his/her possession, and what are they doing with it.\nThe sporadic increase in the level of incidents,with some carrying severe consequences, was proof of the fact that this has become a problem of significant concern in the space.\nSince the lack of transparency puts the security of any transaction in jeopardy, this as now a problem of grave concern.\nA bit of history on smart contracts\nIn 1995, a computer scientist and cryptographer named Nick Szabo conceived the idea of smart contracts and built it into reality. Nick was also known for many other projects related to the blockchain technology, such as Bitgold: at some point, rumor has it that he was Satoshi.\nThere is a fine similarity between Bitcoin and smart contracts, while Bitcoin was created to replace or act as an alternative to fiat, smart contracts were designed to replace the intermediaries in contracts, the human intermediaries. Over the years, we could say that there has been an exponential growth in the number of smart contracts being churned out, more than necessary, I would say.\nBelow is a chart showing the number of new smart-contracts created each quarter since 2015.\nIn contractual agreements, it is this human intermediary factor that engenders setbacks like manipulation of agreements, delay, and sometimes even failure.\nSmart contracts do not have intermediaries, and this is what makes them different. Unlike regular contracts, they are not enforced by a third party or intermediary like a lawyer; the element responsible for implementing a smart contract is the programming language it was coded with. But the thing is, even though Smart contracts may be different from traditional arrangements, they are both still embedded in the same fundamental contract law.\nIn simple terms – based on Cryptocurrency Facts – “A smart contract is a self-executing contract where the terms and conditions are defined and enforced using a software.” The software, in this case, is blockchain technology, and its whole essence is to facilitate and enforce agreements digitally.\nWhy are smart contracts necessary?\nSmart contracts are generally crucial because they fill up the gap and cover-up for the limitations that traditional contracts possess. Some of the three key elements that make smart contracts necessary are:\nAutomation: Contractual agreements are pretty complicated; this is what creates the need for lawyers, brokers, and escrows. All these entities do a lot of good, but in the long term, they cost a lot more and are sometimes not necessary. The use of smart contracts simplifies the process, clearing out all the many people needed to enforce a contract. This brings many benefits like speed, clarity, and precision with each contract.\nCost-efficient: On a rough estimate, it costs between $150 - $1000 per hour to hire a lawyer to look at your contract and work with you. This is quite expensive and might not be cost-efficient in the case of a business setting. Smart contracts are free as opposed to regular deals, and they also execute immediately once the terms that bind the contract has been fulfilled.\nAutonomy: Smart contracts are self-sufficient; once they are entered into, the parties involved are not subject to external authority, only to the terms they agreed on. This feature also makes them free of manipulation, from either party, increasing the safety and security of contractual agreements.\nEver since the introduction of blockchain technology, smart contracts have been the highest form of its application. Added with its autonomous power, speed, and transparency, the possibilities for smart contracts are unlimited.",

Two suspects intended to interfere in the prosecution by obtaining classified and confidential information from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York related to the ongoing federal criminal investigation and prosecution of a Chinese telecommunications company based in China.\nPer Reuters, citing a person familiar with the matter identified the Chinese company as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.\nCurrently, two suspects are wanted by the FBI.\n“Far more than an effort to collect information or intelligence, the actions of the PRC intelligence officers charged in this case must be called out for what they are,” stated Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen\nAccording to the statement, the defendant is charged with two counts of money laundering based upon bribe payments totalling approximately $61,000 in Bitcoin, made in furtherance of the scheme.\nHowever, the recruit from a US law enforcement agency was actually working as a \"double agent\" under Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) supervision, according to the complaint.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland added in the statement, “This was an egregious attempt by PRC intelligence officers to shield a PRC-based company from accountability and to undermine the integrity of our judicial system.”\nSpeaking of Bitcoin Bribes, in 2020, A Russian police officer named Yuri Zaitsev was sentenced to eight years in prison for accepting a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bribe from a dark web drug dealer in exchange for his professional services.\nAs reported by Blockchain.News, the investigation started 2 years prior to his downfall. The former cop was reportedly the former head of the department for a drug trafficking task force operating under the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Republic of Khakassia. He was eventually found guilty of receiving a cryptocurrency bribe and disclosing State secrets.",

The researcher shared this on a Medium post on Nov.18.\nThe researcher claimed that some other researchers have sometimes said that the privacy model of Mimblewimble, a privacy-focused blockchain protocol, is suffering from some weakness and, therefore, flawed. His recent live testing on Grin has proved the speculation to be true since he was able to uncover the sending and receiving of transactions with an estimated success rate of 96%. This made the researcher conclude that Mimblewimble is not a reliable privacy chain.\nOne major thing of concern about this faulty privacy protocol is that it is part of Mimblewimble; it is inherent to the protocol without much hope of being fixed. This unfortunate event made the researcher warn that Grin/ Mimblewimble should not be taken as an alternative privacy protocol with reference to Zcash or Monero.\nThe researcher claimed that Mimblewimble developers are aware of the technical issues and feasibility of an attack, they did not do anything even though he warned them on a Reddit post last year.\nIn the said post, the researcher did not spare any information regarding the attack, how it works, and what it means for privacy tech.

    "content": "The Solana Foundation has launched a real-time tracking dashboard to measure carbon emissions on its blockchain. The foundation collaborated with data platform Trycarbonara to create the dashboard, which is the first \"major smart-contract blockchain\" to measure carbon emissions in real-time. This marks an important step towards promoting transparency and accountability in the blockchain industry.\nThe new dashboard can be found on the Solana Climate website and displays the total node count, megawatt-hours, total carbon emissions average, and marginal use, alongside numerous other indicators. Furthermore, it contains several emissions comparison charts where users can view side-by-side conversions depicting Solana usage versus numerous other emission-producing activities.\nAccording to a blog post from the foundation, the organization hopes that this initiative will set a new standard for measuring emissions in blockchain by publishing this data. The data used to power the Solana Foundation’s real-time carbon emissions dashboard is available open-source and is modeled on the estimated carbon footprint of the Dell PowerEdge R940.\nIt remains to be seen whether other blockchain outfits will adopt similar tracking systems, but this move from the Solana Foundation comes amid increasing global efforts to utilize blockchain technology to monitor carbon emissions around the world.\nAs part of its “Shaping Europe’s digital future” initiative, the European Commission has praised blockchain’s ability to serve as a foundation for the accurate measurement of carbon emissions in any sector. In an article on the EU’s digital strategy blog, the commission wrote, “Blockchain can be utilised through smart contracts to better calculate, track and report on the reduction of the carbon footprint across the entire value chain.”\nThis move towards using blockchain to track carbon emissions is particularly relevant given the global climate crisis and increasing demand for more sustainable and eco-friendly practices.\nIn the United States, President Joe Biden recently floated budget plans that would add an excise on electricity used for cryptocurrency mining in the amount of 30%. This shows that the government is also taking steps towards addressing the energy consumption concerns of the cryptocurrency industry.\nOverall, the Solana Foundation's real-time carbon emissions tracking dashboard is a positive step towards promoting transparency and accountability in the blockchain industry. As more blockchain outfits follow suit, the industry will become more eco-friendly, which is crucial for achieving a sustainable future.",

This emerging market is gaining traction in spite of the uncertain economic times, according to data acquisition and analytics company DappRadar.\nCrypto art pieces selling for more than $100,000\nSeptember 21st marked the first time a crypto art piece had been bought for at least $100,000, following the unprecedented sale of “Matt Kane’s Right Place & Right Time” on Async.art. This served as a signal to show the untapped potential in this emerging market.\nPer the report:\nThe sale of the second piece serves as the icing on the cake in terms of the most paid crypto art in dollars.\nThe quest for a safe haven\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) has triggered a global economic turmoil, and this has heightened investors’ pursuit for a safe store of value. This is one of the factors that is making the crypto art market to gain traction.\nDappRadar acknowledged:\nThese crypto pieces seem to be giving investors value for money because they are unique artworks. For instance, Matt Kane’s 'Right Place & Right Time' piece is distinctive because it produces a new image daily.\nFurthermore, it comprises 24 programmable layers synchronized with Bitcoin’s price volatility in the past 24 hours. The second piece is also exceptional because it utilizes a programmable technology called layering in remaking itself each day.

    "summary": "While there is certainly an aspect of the ‘gold rush’ mentality to the current crypto buzz and surging market caps, it is undeniable that we have passed a legitimate turning point in the history of this revolutionary technology and asset class.",
    "content": "While there is certainly an aspect of the ‘gold rush’ mentality to the current crypto buzz and surging market caps, it is undeniable that we have passed a legitimate turning point in the history of this revolutionary technology and asset class.\nStrong institutional interest, investments of billions of dollars from major corporations like Tesla, and a growing number of companies accepting the bigger and more stable coins as payment have piqued the interest of many who were either on the fence or skeptical just a couple of years ago. If you are new to digital assets and crypto investing, below are 5 places to learn and build your knowledge before and while you wade in.\n/R/CryptoCurrency\nThere is a temptation to lump Reddit investors into the same nefarious group given the Game Stop and other subsequent market scandals over the past couple of months, but that would be unfair. Reddit remains an excellent source of information for learning about pretty much anything, including cryptocurrencies and crypto investing--with a very strong “buyer and reader beware” warning for anyone wading into the often lightly moderated online discussions.\nThe “CryptoCurrency” subreddit is the largest subreddit dedicated to general cryptocurrency investing on the site and features 1.9 million members and hundreds to thousands of users active at any given time. This is a great place for new or tentative investors to sit and soak up the conversation of seasoned vets and, at the very least, absorb some of the lingo, learn about what people are trading and better understand the various market dynamics.\nCoin Desk\nCoin Desk is a cryptocurrency news site specializing primarily in the coverage of Bitcoin, but other major coins as well. The 15-person team, headed by founder Shakil Khan, and located in New York City, publishes dozens of pieces of new content weekly, including commentary and analysis on trends, new technologies, new companies, and popular and rising figures in the world of Bitcoin and digital assets.\nBitcoin Magazine\nBitcoin is one of the original digital and print publications in the cryptocurrency space and has been available since 2012. The company is currently owned and operated by BTC inc. and is based in Nashville, Tennessee, although it started in South Korea.\nBitcoin Magazine is still the go-to source for Bitcoin information for investors and those in the industry. When adding different publications and webzines to your reading list, a good way to curate and manage all the information is by using a news and content aggregator like Feedly. Feedly is a free web application that allows you to add virtually any online publication to your reading list and it collects the daily posts and updates from each one.\nWhite Papers\nIf you really want to do a deep dive on a particular coin or technology, the best source of information, at least when it comes to learning about the underlying fundamentals that make the asset work and constitute its value proposition, is going to be its white paper. White papers can be long (over 100 pages) and their objective is to explain both how a coin works, the market needs that it serves and why it is an attractive digital asset for investors. These dense documents are released either prior to the release of the coin itself or in conjunction. It is difficult to say you truly understand the ins and outs of a particular digital asset until you have read the white paper.\nConclusion\nMany people who were either unaware or uninterested in cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class and investment are now beginning to see the revolutionary potential. Decentralized, mutual ledger technology that does not require intermediaries, cannot be confiscated by local or international governments, and is, in theory, well-insulated against the vicissitudes of the market and sporadic monetary policy has a tremendous amount of potential.\nA handful of visionaries and brave investors took a bet on all this well over a decade ago and won big. The next generation of retail crypto investors are now wanting to test the waters for themselves, eager not to miss out on what may be the major financial revolution of their lifetimes. If you are interested in learning, you can’t go wrong using any or all of the above sources.",

Reuters reported on Oct 20 that David Marcus, the head leading the Libra project for Facebook, suggested that the project could use alternative stablecoins in replacement of the initially proposed token. At a banking seminar earlier in the week, Marcus reportedly stated that the primary goals of this project were to develop an increasingly efficient payment system as well as considering at all the alternative approaches.\nIt is worth noting that the original proposition backing the Libra Token was a range of international currencies, including; USD, JPY, GBP, and SGD. While Marcus has stated that the mentioned currencies were not the project’s first choice, they do remain agile.\nThe Libra the association has reported losses of critical members in recent weeks, including PayPal, Visa, eBay, Mastercard, and Stripe. This all occurred due to the lack of compliance with the project and the American Anti-Money Laundering standards. Libra, overall, is continuing to face global pressures and increased skepticism over the project and its impact on the financial stability of economies worldwide.",

    "content": "Hidden Road Partners is in talks with hedge funds and many of the top 20 global banks about providing access to trade or hedging their crypto risks, Bloomberg reported citing executives at the firm.\nHidden Road Partners is a prime brokerage focusing on digital assets and foreign exchange.\nLast month, Hidden Road Partners completed a $50 million funding round last month that included Citadel Securities, as well as the investment arms of cryptocurrency exchanges FTX Trading Ltd. and Coinbase Global Inc.\nThis move by the prime brokerage startup is being seen to ease Wall Street's entry into crypto trading by tackling counterparty risks and conflicts of interest.\nManaging counterparty risk has come at a critical time as the recent crypto downturn has led to the default of influential crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and crypto lenders and brokers such as Celsius Network Ltd. and Voyager Digital Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\"Such credit risks could hamper traditional funds' interests in trading directly with cryptocurrency firms,\" Bloomberg said.\nRamnik Arora, a general partner at FTX's venture arms, said, \"the recent episode with crypto lenders has made it abundantly clear that the industry is in need of better real-time credit risk management.\"\n\"Hidden Road is making it easier for risk-conscious borrowers to access credit markets, reducing systemic risk for the ecosystem.\"\nThe startup was founded in 2018 by Marc Asch, formerly with Steven Cohen's hedge fund SAC Capital and Point72 Asset Management. Hidden Road initially started with foreign-exchange services and expanded into digital assets in October.\nThe company allows banks or other institutions to post dollars as collateral in a \"tri-party\" set up with a custodian and receive profits and losses in dollars. However, this is only limited to those banks or institutions that cannot hold digital assets directly.\nClients can trade with exchanges as well as liquidity providers, including Virtu Financial Inc., Optiver BV and Wintermute Trading Ltd.\nThere is an increasing number of crypto platforms and brokers vying for institutional traders. But Hidden Road claims that, unlike many others, its pure-play structure would eliminate potential conflict of interests.\n\"The firm takes on counterparty risks on behalf of the client and the crypto exchange or market maker. If a counterparty defaults, the startup would be on the hook for completing the defaulted side of the trade. In exchange, Hidden Road's prime-brokerage fee incorporates this aspect of credit risk,\" Bloomberg said.\nThe business model for Hidden Road does not include carrying a huge balance sheet to lend to its clients; instead, the firm raises capital from investors such as pension funds and pays them a return on capital. It generates returns by providing financing to clients for their trading activities.\nThe company's risk mitigation involves using a real-time system, which sets risk limits and requires portions of collateral upfront.\nHidden Road said it plans to enter futures and options clearing.",

    "content": "B² (B Square) Network, a player in Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, secures substantial seed-round investments from an array of influential venture capital firms. This strategic financial infusion marks a pivotal moment for B² Network as it aims to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities and foster a robust ecosystem around its Layer 2 infrastructure.\nAt the forefront of this financial boost are esteemed entities like HashKey Capital, OKX Ventures, IDG Capital, KuCoin Ventures, ABCDE Labs, Waterdrip Capital, OGs Fund, and Antalpha Group. Their investment signifies a collective belief in B² Network's vision and the potential of Bitcoin's Layer 2 as a transformative technology in the blockchain domain.\nBuilding on Bitcoin’s Layer 2\nB² Network's unique position as the first EVM-compatible Rollup and the inaugural DA layer for Bitcoin rollups leverages zero-knowledge proof verification commitment. This technological innovation aims to address Bitcoin's inherent limitations, mainly scalability and transaction speed, by implementing advanced solutions inspired by Ethereum's layered architecture.\nThe introduction of B² Network's Layer 2 solutions is poised to revolutionize Bitcoin's utility, extending its functionality beyond a mere store of value. This shift is expected to integrate Bitcoin more effectively into both traditional and decentralized financial systems, consequently increasing its appeal to institutional investors and the wider crypto community.\nEnhancing Bitcoin's Ecosystem\nWith the secured investments, B² Network plans to construct the most practical Bitcoin Layer 2 network, an endeavor that is not only technologically ambitious but also culturally significant. The project aims to revitalize the builder culture within the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering an environment where innovation and development are paramount.\nThe significance of this development can be contextualized by understanding the current landscape of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions. Recent reports from Spartan Group and Kyle Ellicott highlight the emergence of secondary networks such as Stacks, Lightning, Rootstock, and Liquid, which aim to resolve Bitcoin's scalability and functionality challenges. These networks are vital in activating Bitcoin's dormant capital, valued at over $800 billion, thereby unlocking its full potential.\nFurthermore, platforms like Synonym Finance, which recently raised $1.5 million in an oversubscribed seed round led by Borderless Capital, are testament to the growing interest and investment in Layer 2 solutions. Synonym Finance focuses on cross-chain DeFi lending, highlighting the diversification and potential of Layer 2 technologies.\nA Step Towards Mainstream Adoption\nB² Network's ambitious project, backed by substantial investments, is a significant stride towards enhancing Bitcoin's capabilities. By addressing key issues of scalability and functionality, B² Network is not only expanding Bitcoin's use cases but also paving the way for its increased adoption in both the traditional and decentralized finance sectors. The involvement of prominent venture capital firms further underscores the growing interest and confidence in Bitcoin's Layer 2 potential, signaling an exciting era of innovation and growth in the blockchain ecosystem.",

    "summary": "Liechtenstein's introduction of the world’s first blockchain business law represents an important milestone in the evolution of legal frameworks to support blockchain business.",
    "content": "After some three years of work, Liechtenstein has introduced what some have described as the world’s first blockchain business law (the Lichtenstein Token and Trusted Technologies Law’) which will go into effect in January 2020.\nLiechtenstein’s legislation is focused on creating both the legal certainty and framework necessary to conduct blockchain business and the country hopes to use it to distinguish itself from other rivals, such as Malta, Gibraltar, Singapore, Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, who are also courting blockchain companies.\nThe new blockchain law’s introduction is important given the growing number of questions raised by blockchain applications related to customer and asset protection as well as the misuse of the technology for money laundering or other criminal purposes.\nLiechtenstein’s law contrasts with similar blockchain laws from other countries which are primarily directed at cryptocurrencies. It employs the term “transaction systems based on trustworthy technologies” or TT systems rather than, for example, “blockchain applications”, so as to provide technological independence; that is, the law can work with technologies other than blockchain including future ones.\nOne should note that under the new law, a token is a piece of \"information on a TT system\", which digitally \"represents\" rights over claims, memberships, goods or other rights, and which can be assigned to a TT identifier. A token represents a data record consisting of public and private keys and that can be assigned to a user, it is a repository of digital assets. The user can access or do other things (such as dispose of the token) using the keys.\nA sharp user would note that this could be a problem if, for example, a TT system provider or a user’s system was hacked. While this is an obvious weakness in the law one should note that someone hacking into your computer to take digital property is analogous to the situation where someone could break into your home and steal your valuables.\nAnother thing to be aware of is that tokens, being digital property, are not treated the same way Liechtenstein’s present laws deal with physical property and that the law is limited to TT service providers in Liechtenstein.\nWhile imperfect, the new law is nevertheless an important development in the blockchain world and we should congratulate this small nation for taking this first step and hope it can earn some first-mover advantage.",

They will also attain a percentage of the profits from the same.\nThe American administration continues to view blockchain as a game-changer in streamlining various sectors. For instance, in July, through its federal agency the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it revealed its consideration for blockchain as one of the technological innovations that could prompt traceability and food safety culture.\nThe FDA noted that blockchain could help in tracing new sources of food ingredients to help in bending the curve of foodborne illness in the nation.",

The SEC has punctuated this stance through enforcement against high profile projects like Telegram and EOS provider, Block.One who was fined 24 million dollars for its ICO offering.\nSEC Commissioner, Hester Peirce has been a breath of fresh air to the sector and has earned the moniker of “Crypto-Mom” for her bold attitude towards digital innovation.\nAs reported by Blockchain.News, Peirce recently doubled down on her previous suggestion to provide decentralized network developers a safe harbor and has now submitted a formal draft proposal.\nThe safe harbor proposal recommends that a three-year reprieve from securities law should be granted to developers and projects that can demonstrate they are raising funds and making progress towards an open-source network. These projects will be required to make full disclosures regarding their raised funds to the public.",

Some of the information to be stored includes the provenance of ownership, product data, and transaction details and history. The digital certificate will be hosted on the VeChain Thor Blockchain based on an MOU signed between the company and VeChain.\nConsequently, Reebonz's mobile application will be used in verifying products and digital certificates will be generated after verification.\nThe Sell Back Guarantee service will also be made possible through the digital certificate which buyers can become sellers and vice versa. For instance, a customer will have the liberty to sell back a product to the company as it will be in a position to digitally validate the product certificate.\nIn case of theft, customers can revoke the digital certificate as this will guarantee product protection.\nSamuel Lim, Reebonz’s co-founder and CEO, noted, \"We are excited to use the blockchain technology and work with VeChain to solve one of the key global issues impacting our industry. The authentication of pre-owned luxury items using the blockchain is just one of many high impact innovations Reebonz is pioneering to improve the luxury shopping experience for customers across the Asia Pacific.\"\nBlockchain is being embraced because of the transparency and trust solutions it offers.\nSunny Lu, VeChain’s CEO and co-founder, asserted, \"Our partnership with Reebonz sets a new standard for solutions based on VeChainThor Blockchain, which will be gaining momentum in the luxury industry with increasingly extensive applications.\"\nHe added, “Developing such a solution with a global and local mindset will pave the way forward for innovation, enabling frictionless, trustworthy, and transparent e-commerce of luxury products and finally changing the operating model of the industry.”\nBy leveraging on blockchain technology, Reebonz seeks to prioritize its mission of making luxury products accessible to everyone through its ecosystem that connects buyers and sellers.",

    "summary": "Congresswoman Maxine Waters scrutinizes Meta's trademark applications, filed in March 2022, suggesting the company's continued involvement in the digital assets ecosystem, despite previous assurances of no ongoing projects in this area.",
    "content": "Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Ranking Member of the United States House Financial Services Committee, questions Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook) regarding its trademark applications indicative of a potential expansion in the digital assets ecosystem.\nWaters' concerns, conveyed in a letter dated January 22, 2024, to Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Javier Olivan, stem from five trademark applications filed by Meta on March 18, 2022. Despite Meta's assertion on October 12, 2023, that the company was not engaging in any digital assets work, these applications suggest otherwise. The committee is pressing Meta for clarity on any ongoing or planned blockchain or crypto-related projects.\nThe trademark applications cover a range of services in the crypto and blockchain sphere, including trading, exchange, payments, transfers, and the associated hardware and software infrastructure. A Notice of Allowance (NOA) for each filing indicates Meta's applications meet registration requirements. Meta must now file a statement of use or request an extension within six months of the NOA issuance dates, which range from August 2023 to January 2024.\nThis inquiry isn't Maxine Waters' first involvement in scrutinizing tech giants' forays into the digital assets sector. In 2019, Waters was vocal in her concerns over Meta’s Libra (later Diem) stablecoin project. Meta had announced its plans to develop the cryptocurrency and a corresponding digital wallet, Calibra. However, the project faced significant backlash from lawmakers and regulators, leading to its eventual discontinuation and the sale of its assets to Silvergate Bank in January 2022.\nWaters' letter questions the extent of Meta's involvement in digital assets, including any plans to launch a crypto payments platform, the company's research into stablecoins, partnerships with stablecoin projects, and the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The congresswoman is particularly concerned about the implications of big tech companies like Meta entering the digital assets space, given their access to vast amounts of user data and the lack of a federal framework for regulating such ventures.\nIn the broader context, Meta's involvement in digital assets reflects a growing trend among tech giants exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency as potential new business avenues. However, this expansion raises critical questions about user privacy, data security, regulatory compliance, and the impact on traditional financial systems.",

    "content": "Analysis suggests institutional investors have an increasingly optimistic stance on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, while retail investors are still hesitant to return to the market.\nPreviously, BlackRock, the world's largest investment management firm, partnered with Coinbase to offer cryptocurrency trading services to its institutional clients. A few days later, the company announced the launch of the Bitcoin Spot Private Trust.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Leah Wald, CEO of digital asset investment management firm Valkyrie Funds, said in an interview with Bloomberg that:\nThis institutional investment in the digital asset space shows that institutional interest in digital assets has not waned due to the slump in the cryptocurrency market.\nAccording to Coinbase’s second-quarter earnings report, the cryptocurrency exchange’s core retail customers have been inactive and on the sidelines.\nThe exchange recorded a record loss of $1.1 billion for the quarter.\nJames Malcolm, head of foreign exchange and crypto research at UBS, believes that the cryptocurrency market is still primarily a retail-driven market. That group will return when it feels like a bottom has been reached.\n“The hope is that at some point in the future, institutions will come into the space, institutional adoption will pick up a lot, and it will start to look more like traditional financial markets. But this is still predominantly a retail-driven market,” Malcolm added.\nNevertheless, retail investors continue jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon based on the rise of non-zero BTC addresses. Among small addresses, those holding less than one bitcoin are climbing rapidly, according to Market insight provider Glassnode.\nNoelle Acheson, Head of Market Insights at Genesis, said: “This suggests that retail is participating, just not yet in the kind of size that would add more momentum to the overall market.”",

    "content": "On October 30, 2023, Snowtrace.io, a popular blockchain explorer tool dedicated to the Avalanche C-Chain, announced that it would be discontinuing its Etherscan-powered explorer effective from November 30, 2023 (00:00 UTC). This announcement came through a series of tweets from Snowtrace's official Twitter handle, @SnowTraceHQ. The Snowtrace team expressed their gratitude towards the Avalanche community (@avax) for their support over the last two years.\nThe Snowtrace team stressed the importance of backing up crucial information. They specifically urged users to save backups of Private Name Tags and Contract Verification details before the discontinuation date. An official reminder was also issued 17 hours before the post, reiterating the urgency to backup such information, linking to a page on Etherscan's website for further details regarding the discontinuation of the blockchain explorer.\nAlthough the official announcement did not clarify the reason behind the discontinuation, some individuals within the crypto community speculated that the high service costs associated with Etherscan's Explorer-as-a-Service (EaaS) framework could be a driving factor. Mikko Ohtama, Co-founder of Trading Strategy, estimated the annual EaaS subscription cost to be between one to two million dollars, potentially making it a costly endeavor for Snowtrace to continue its operations under the existing framework.\nAmidst the buzz, Phillip Liu Jr., the Director of Strategy and Operations at Ava Labs, commented on the development. He mentioned that the protocol is transitioning to \"something better\" and affirmed that operations would \"absolutely not\" cease, indicating a probable shift to an alternative solution for blockchain exploration.\nThe episode underscores the dependencies and potential challenges faced by blockchain explorers leveraging Etherscan’s EaaS framework. It sheds light on the importance of renewing service agreements, ensuring sufficient bandwidth, and maintaining adequate traffic to keep a block explorer operational. The Snowtrace scenario serves as a strong reminder to users about the significance of backing up their data, especially when utilizing third-party services for blockchain exploration.\nWhile the exact future of Snowtrace remains uncertain, the proactive communication from its team regarding the discontinuation and urging users to backup their data demonstrates a responsible approach towards handling such transitions. The anticipation now pivots towards what alternative solutions will emerge to fill the void left by Snowtrace's discontinuation and how Ava Labs plans to navigate this change.",

    "content": "The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has just announced that it will begin experimenting with a Digital Yen, its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to test its technical application and feasibility.\nAlthough no timetable for Japan’s CBDC experimentation has been revealed, this is the first announcement by the BoJ that it will commence a Proof of Concept (PoC) process with the Digital Yen.\nThe BoJ published a report called Technical Hurdles for CBDC, in which the bank disclosed that it would check the feasibility of CBDC from a technical perspective while continuing to collaborate with other central banks that are also in development.\nTwo Technical Issues Identified\nAccording to the report, the BoJ identified two major technical issues to overcome with its CBDC—universal access and resilience.\nOne is universal access, which as the name implies is to grant access to everyone including those who do not use smartphones. Surprisingly, in a country known for cutting edge tech, Japan’s smartphone penetration sits only at around 75% today, according to the Communications and Information Network Association of Japan.\nThe second issue referred to in the BoJ report is called “Resilience”—referring to accessibility to the Digital Yen offline in the event of a power outage or natural disaster.\nWill the Digital Yen use Blockchain?\nThe report highlights the BoJ’s considerations of incorporating blockchain technology in its CBDC plans. The paper states that a centralized system that does not include DLT has larger capacities and are generally much faster as the transactions do not need consensus—but this opens up the entire system to a single point of failure which can be attacked or could disrupt the entire system if it goes down.\nOn the flip-side, a blockchain-based CBDC will be immune to a single point of failure and be capable of “resilience” but is generally slower as consensus must be achieved across the decentralized network.\nCurbing China’s DCEP\nBank of Japan (BoJ), the nation’s central bank is aiming to create a digitized Yen to curb the potential influence of China’s own CBDC development—the Digital Yuan or Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). There have been many reports that China is already actively testing its DCEP across a range of civilians, government employees, and even some global organizations within the mainland.\nIn February, six central banks around the world came together to create a working group to share experiences on use cases on central bank digital currency (CBDC). With significant expertise in exploring digital currencies, these six central banks are the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central bank, Sveriges Riksbank in Sweden, and the Swiss National Bank, along with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\nIt was reported that Japan has also requested support from the US Federal Reserve to get in front of China. Norihiro Nakayama, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in Japan was quoted saying that he wishes the “Federal Reserve would partner with six other central banks including the Bank of Japan in studying digital currencies.”",

    "content": "The scaling solution for Ethereum's layer 2 To far, StarkWare has processed 327 million transactions and coined 95 million nonfungible tokens (NFTs). StarkWare has announced intentions to open source their proprietary Starknet Prover under the Apache 2.0 licence. This will take place in the near future.\nThe prover is an essential piece of software that Starkware employs in order to wrap up hundreds of thousands of transactions and condense them into a brief cryptographic proof that is then recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\"Here at Stark Industries, we consider the Prover to be the technological equivalent of a magic wand. \"It does a fantastic job of generating the proofs that enable inconceivable scalability,\" said Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder of Starkware. \"It allows unprecedented growth.\"\nStarkware has come under fire from the cryptocurrency community as well as solutions that compete with it, such as ZK Sync and Polygon, for the fact that it retains ownership of the intellectual property (IP) that underpins its technology. This runs counter to the open source and interoperable ethics that underpin blockchain technology.\nBy making the prover open source and releasing it under the Apache 2.0 licence, any other project or network, as well as producers of games or databases, will be allowed to utilise the technology, modify the code, and personalise it as they see fit. The technology didn't become widely available until 2020, but ImmutableX, Sorare, and dYdX are already making use of it.\nAvihu Levy, head of product at Starkware, was hesitant to commit to a time period for open-sourcing the prover but said that it will take place after the introduction of the token and the decentralisation of Starknet itself. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that it would be doable throughout this year.\nLevy said that the choice to open source the prover demonstrated that Starkware was becoming more confidence in its technology. He also stated that it would allow projects to become more confident about using it as an essential component of their protocols.\n\"Within StarkEx, this is something that is sometimes referred to as vendor lock-up or lock-in. Therefore, the commitment to StarkEx was not merely a commercial commitment; rather, it was a commitment to the company's technological development,\" he stated.\n\"This is a clear indication that you will have everything at your disposal to operate it without relying on Starkware,\" the speaker said.\nStarkware's programming language and EVM rival, Cairo 1.0, as well as Papyrus Full node, have both been open-sourced, and the company is now in the process of open-sourcing their newest sequencer.\nThe Starkware Sessions conference was kicked off on Sunday in Tel Aviv by Ben-Sasson. According to the event's organisers, it is the biggest layer 2 conference that has been hosted up to this point.\nAround 500 visitors and engineers were in attendance when he made the statement. \"This is a watershed moment for scaling Ethereum,\" he said. It will establish Stark technology as a public asset that can be put to use for the common welfare of all people, which is the proper position for it.",

    "content": "The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a paper going over the ‘design of prudential treatment for crypto-assets.’ on Dec.12. It covers several areas such as the risks rising from crypto-asset exposures, as crypto-assets are typically volatile and considered immature due to the lack of standardization and consistent product evolution, especially during periods of financial uncertainty.\nThe committee has reviewed several risk factors that may be presented to banks, in the matter of crypto assets. For example, liquidity and market risks as well as credit and counterparty risks. Non-financial risks equally play a part, such as cyber and operation risks to legal risks.\nThe report also discussed the capital and liquidity requirements for direct holdings for crypto assets; i) Banking book treatment, refers to bank exposures to crypto-assets that are subjected to a full deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 capital; ii) Trading book treatments – with crypto-asset exposures positioned in trading books that are entitled to full deductions for market risk and credit valuations and many more.\nThe final parts of the report equally looked at general considerations for prudential treatment for other types of crypto assets, including crypto-assets for intra and interbank settlements and crypto-assets that use stabilization tools linked to other assets.\nAccording to the press release, the committee is open to any comments on the analyses and ideas set out in the report from most financial institutions, by 13 March 2020.",

    "content": "The crypto industry has witnessed another major hack in less than a week, where a hacker has stolen $100 million from Mango Markets.\nThe trading and lending platform hosted on the Solana blockchain was exploited after manipulation in the price of Mango Market's native MANGO token via an oracle price manipulation attack.\nMango Markets has confirmed via a tweet that the company is investigating the matter. \"We are currently investigating an incident where a hacker was able to drain funds from Mango via an oracle price manipulation. We are taking steps to have third parties freeze funds in flight,\" the tweet said.\nThe company also has disabled deposits as a security measure.\n\"We will be disabling deposits on the front end as a precaution and will keep you updated as the situation evolves,\" Mango Markets tweeted.\nThe hacker's wallet was funded from an FTX exchange account.\nAccording to blockchain security firm Hacken's tweets, the hacker first opened an enormous size futures position, which resulted in MANGO token price pump. That further spiked the hacker's account collateral value and gave access to borrowing a large debt position across multiple coins on Mango Market's borrowing and lending platform.\nAccording to Hacken, the hacker was then able to borrow and steal roughly $114 million across various tokens since the price of tokens and their collateral was manipulated much higher.\nIt is yet to understand how, exactly, the hacker was able to inflate MNGO's value in the eyes of the Mango protocol, according to Robert Chen from blockchain auditors OtterSec.\nThe attack caused the price of MANGO tokens to drop around 50%, Mango Markets' price feed showed.\nMango Markets has contacted the hacker through a statement regarding a bounty for the return of the funds.\nThe company, a decentralised crypto exchange, offers users the ability to make spot trades and loans.\nThis exploit was the second major decentralised finance attack in less than a week. The crypto industry witnessed an $80 million hack last week on Binance's BNB blockchain.\nThe Binance Coins (BNB) were stolen after an exploit occurred on a bridge between blockchains.\nAccording to Chainalysis, the total revenue for crypto crime in the first half of this year stood at $1.6 billion, less than the figure recorded in the first half of 2021. The drop in crypto crime figures has coincided with a fall in crypto values. However, some forms of crypto-crime have risen in the last year, such as the value of hacked crypto assets has increased from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion.\nWhile Bloomberg reported that about $2 billion had been lost in crypto hacks this year, many of those hacks were perpetrated by North Korea-linked groups, and cross-chain bridges used to transfer tokens across blockchains have been a popular target.\nThe Binance hack has shown that even though the Binance ecosystem is among the highest profile, it can still be buffeted.",

The privacy coin is the invention of John McAfee, a British American Inventor famous for the game-changing anti-virus software McAfee. Ghost coin has unique features that further the fundamental agenda of blockchain technology which includes providing complete anonymity when making transactions. Ghost transactions use a state of the art escrow pool to shield and erase the history of transactions. GHOST transactions are verified using zero-knowledge proofs.\nThe super-privacy coin runs on a decentralized system that uses a proof-of-stake network controlled by GHOST token holders and users. GHOST has no central company or owner and is run and maintained by the community. The unique features of Ghost have attracted businesses in the UAE and Hong Kong where payment startups ZelaaPayAE and iVendPay are helping to drive its integration by vendors.\nHigher Expectations\nMcAfee’s Ghostcoin has gained a lot of attention from the cryptocurrency sector since the announcement of its impending launch. While it may be too early to rate the coin’s users' experience, blockchain enthusiasts' reaction to the series of strides the coin has made is impressive. In keeping up with future expectations, the project will need to amply introduce more value while creating bigger markets across countries. In all, the blockchain ecosystem stands as a winner with this new addition to the family.",

However, despite the huge blow suffered by the cryptocurrency exchange, Ethereum and Bitcoin prices have been unaffected on the market.\nStolen crypto will leave a blockchain trail\nCrypto traders on their end have also been unfazed by the possibility that Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) prices may potentially dip as a result of the hacker’s attempt to sell off his stolen ERC-20 funds.\nIt has been observed that the KuCoin hacker has tried to sell off his stolen ERC-20 tokens on Uniswap. However, though this method would allow the anonymous hacker to obtain Ether once the ERC-20 tokens were converted, the stolen amount would still leave traces, as it runs on Ethereum blockchain.\nWith block explorers, the crypto trail can easily be traced. This will enable coin exchanges to suspend suspicious exchange addresses associated with the stolen crypto and lead them to the hacker.\nWith the stolen assets amounting to millions of dollars, any attempts to sell off the funds would also prove to be a risky task.\nKuCoin alerts other exchanges, Tether freezes funds\nSince the security breach, KuCoin has been quick to react to the security leak, taking matters into its own hands and alerting other coin exchanges of the hack. Bitfinex, Binance, Huobi Global, OKEx, and BitMex were among the crypto exchanges that were contacted.\nChief technical officer of Bitfinex and Tether (USDT), Paolo Ardoino announced that Tether had also frozen $33 million worth of USDT in an attempt to avoid the stolen crypto from being laundered. He said:\nDeFi tokens, ETH, and BTC unfazed\nWith KuCoin’s active effort to regain the funds, it has been increasingly difficult for the anonymous hacker to liquidate the funds. It has also been observed that DeFi tokens, Ethereum, and Bitcoin’s prices have barely been impacted by the hack, with Ether’s price barely budging from its $350 level.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin has even surged higher than last week, sitting at around $10,930, according to data on CoinGecko. Bitcoin’s consolidation above the $10,700 point may be a potential indicator that the overall market sentiment is strong, as the crypto asset’s price was unaffected despite a huge security breach.",

    "summary": "Zhao, Binance's former CEO, reveals a new education-centric blockchain project, excluding token offerings, with details to follow.",
    "content": "The former Chief Executive Officer of Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has teased the launch of a new project deeply rooted in educational efforts surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This news comes as the industry increasingly recognizes the importance of informed participation and knowledge-sharing in fostering a sustainable and inclusive digital economy.\nChangpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, has indicated that this initiative will starkly contrast with many other cryptocurrency projects, by specifically excluding the creation or involvement of a new token. This approach aims to distance the endeavor from the financial speculation that often accompanies token launches, centering the project's focus on education and widespread blockchain literacy.\nWhile details remain scant at this stage, the announcement has already sparked interest across the crypto community, with stakeholders eager to understand the scope, nature, and potential impact of Zhao's educational project. With a promise of more information to come, there is speculation that the initiative could encompass a variety of formats, from online courses and workshops to educational materials and community outreach programs.\nGiven Zhao's prominence in the industry and Binance's expansive user base, this initiative has the potential to make significant strides in cryptocurrency education. The lack of a token offering also suggests a commitment to providing public goods without immediate commercial incentives, a move that could help bolster the credibility and altruistic perception of the project.\nIn the context of the broader crypto ecosystem, education has been pinpointed as a crucial factor in driving adoption and fostering a safer investment environment. Amidst regulatory scrutiny and a history of high-profile scams and misinformation, clear and accessible educational resources could play a critical role in mitigating risks for new entrants and empowering users with the knowledge to navigate the complex landscape of digital assets.\nAs the industry awaits further details of Zhao's educational project, this announcement aligns with a broader trend of crypto platforms investing in educational initiatives. Major exchanges like Coinbase and platforms like Ethereum have also dedicated resources to improving blockchain literacy, underscoring the collective understanding that education is key to the sector's long-term success and public acceptance.\nDespite Zhao's departure from the executive role at Binance, his continued influence and commitment to the cryptocurrency community remain evident through this new venture. The project's forthcoming details will be closely watched by enthusiasts, industry players, and educational institutions alike, as they anticipate the potential contributions to a more knowledgeable and informed digital asset space.",

The application has processed more than $600 million in transactions year-to-date, with a daily transaction volume of $5 million.\nEvgeny Yurtaev, CEO and co-founder at Zerion, stated that:\nZerion provides users with a single entry point to easily manage their digital assets. Any asset traded on the Ethereum blockchain (and other blockchains shortly) can be traded on Zerion, including the DeFi index and yield generating assets, liquidity pools, and automation strategies.\nUnlike trading platforms such as Coinbase or Robinhood, Zerion does not have custody of its users' funds. This means that it will not store users' digital assets on the platform, which greatly reduces the risk of centralisation and stimulates the platform's rapid growth.\nThe platform currently supports Ethereum-based assets and protocols, and Zerion is also actively seeking multi-chain support. Yurtaev stated that it would fully support other blockchains in the third quarter of this year, including Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).",

Despite the envisioned lower monetization rate at 20% of Ethereum's (ETH) and smaller market shares due to community philosophy differences, there's a credible trajectory to $8 billion in revenues for SOL token holders by the end of the decade.\nCentral to Solana's promise is its technical prowess, particularly in scaling blockchain operations. Through rigorous optimization, Solana achieves higher transaction throughput, surpassing many legacy competitors. This technical edge extends to its data throughput capacity, a critical metric for blockchain efficacy, which is slated for a tenfold increase with the upcoming Firedancer upgrade. The blockchain's unique features like Local Fee Markets further refine the user experience by effectively managing transaction costs and system congestion.\nSolana's innovative spirit has birthed an array of ventures, such as blockchain-optimized mobile phones and consumer-centric applications like decentralized mapping. Its initial vision of becoming a \"Decentralized Nasdaq\" has broadened with the advent of intriguing non-financial applications, underpinned by partnerships with industry giants like Shopify, Visa, and Google, which augment its ecosystem.\nHowever, sustainability concerns loom. A glaring discrepancy between Solana’s revenue ($1.26 million) and blockchain security costs ($52.78 million) over a recent 30-day period underscores the pressing need for a more balanced financial framework. The continuous influx of speculative capital to offset validator selling pressure, against a backdrop of minuscule transaction fees, paints a challenging picture for long-term economic viability.\nSolana's journey is also marred by technical instabilities, with notable network downtimes between January 2022 and February 2023. Despite subsequent improvements, the complexity of Solana's design, coupled with a high bar of programming proficiency, hinders a broader developer engagement. The blockchain's share of active crypto developers has stagnated around 6-7% over the last 18 months, which might impede its ambition to host tomorrow's blockbuster applications.\nUtilizing a standardized valuation framework, VanEck projects a base SOL token valuation of $335 by 2030, based on an expected real rate of return applied to the terminal year's Free Cash Flow. The projection, however, is pinned on substantial growth in user and developer adoption, which presently trails that of Ethereum. The potential implementation of token-voting governance by 2030 could enhance SOL token economics, provided a vibrant ecosystem activity ensues.\nSolana, with its relentless focus on user-centric innovations and blockchain efficiency, offers a compelling narrative. Yet, its path to significant valuation and ecosystem growth is fraught with technical, financial, and developer adoption challenges that require diligent addressing to ensure a robust and sustainable blockchain platform through 2030 and beyond.",

    "title": "What is Bitcoin Ordinals?",
    "summary": "Bitcoin Ordinals, introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, are a way to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain.",
    "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals, also known as digital artifacts, are a way to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. They were introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, a programmer and artist, who saw an opportunity to create a unique experience on the Bitcoin blockchain similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and other blockchains.\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\nBitcoin Ordinals are a system for numbering and tracking individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), transforming them into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ordinals are based on ordinal theory, which gives individual identities to satoshis and allows them to be tracked, transferred, and imbued with meaning.\nThe Ordinals protocol assigns a unique number to each satoshi based on when it was mined. Smaller numbers correspond to older satoshis. As transactions occur, the Ordinals protocol tracks each satoshi through subsequent transactions in a \"first-in-first-out\" scheme. The satoshis' identifying numbers are called Ordinals, as both the identification and the tracking mechanism are dependent on the chronological order of creation and transactions.\nHow do Bitcoin Ordinals work?\nOrdinals simply refer to the system for numbering and tracking satoshis. Each satoshi is assigned a unique identifying number when they are created (mined) which can be traced through every subsequent transaction. Each satoshi identified by the Ordinals protocol can also be referred to as an Ordinal.\nThe Ordinals protocol assigns a number to each satoshi based on the order in which it was created, called the integer. It also assigns a decimal based on the satoshi’s position in the block height of its Bitcoin block. Finally, its position in the entire Bitcoin supply is expressed as a percentile, and its name is assigned using the letters a-z. The names of satoshis get shorter as time goes on, such that the last satoshi ever mined will be “a.”\nAfter a satoshi has been identified by the Ordinals protocol, users can inscribe a satoshi with arbitrary data to give it its unique characteristics, defined as a digital artifact. Writing arbitrary data into a satoshi only became possible after the SegWit (2017) and Taproot (2021) upgrades to Bitcoin Core.\nHow to buy, sell, and trade Ordinals?\nMuch like the process of minting Bitcoin Ordinals, the trading process hasn’t had matured tooling. Yet there are a few tools to trade these digital artifacts. As Bitcoin Ordinals grow in popularity, most of the trades have been largely over-the-counter. However, tools like the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro, and Xverse allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin Ordinals.\nOrdinals Wallets\nOrdinal wallets provide a simple way to store and collect digital artifacts created using Ordinals. Here are some of the trusted Ordinal wallets:\nThe Ordinals Wallet: Launched on February 16, 2023, the Ordinals Wallet is a Bitcoin wallet that allows users to hold, store, view, transfer, send, inscribe, and buy and sell Ordinals directly from within the wallet. It has a user-friendly interface and is a community-funded project.\nHiro Wallet: Launched on February 14, 2023, Hiro Wallet allows users to securely store, send, and receive Bitcoin, and create and store Ordinal NFT inscriptions in minutes. It is compatible with popular Ordinals platforms such as Gamma, OrdinalsBot, and other emerging apps, allowing for inscription directly in the web browser.\nOrdinals vs. traditional NFTs\nOrdinals are different from traditional NFTs from a technical design perspective. There are several features that make the pricing for ordinals a different exercise. Bitcoin Ordinals help identify satoshis uniquely and have content or art stored on-chain. Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard, which is used to create NFTs, typically holds the metadata or a pointer to the art, which is generally held off-chain. Some Ethereum NFTs are experimenting with on-chain storage, but they are more of an exception.\nFuture of Bitcoin Ordinals\nBitcoin Ordinals are a new technology and the use cases for them keep growing. They have been used to port Ethereum (and other chain) NFT collections to Bitcoin, but unique projects are also beginning to stake a claim to digital artifacts tied to the original cryptocurrency. As demand from ordinary users and followers increases, the ecosystem and the tooling should start maturing with more user-friendly journeys.",

    "summary": "Paradigm is in talks to secure up to $850 million for a new fund, potentially marking the largest crypto-focused fundraise since May 2022.",
    "content": "Paradigm, a leading crypto investment firm, is reportedly in advanced discussions to raise as much as $850 million for a new fund. This development comes as a bold step and a strong signal of continued investor interest in the digital assets sector despite the volatile market conditions.\nThe fundraising target, if reached, would represent the most considerable sum amassed for a crypto-focused fund since May 2022, underscoring a resilient appetite for long-term investment in blockchain technology and digital currencies. Paradigm's initiative follows its previous success in November 2021, where the firm raised a $2.5 billion fund, one of the largest of its kind at the time.\nThe proposed $750 million, which could stretch to $850 million with the final closing, indicates Paradigm's commitment to deepening its footprint in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The firm is known for its strategic investments across various segments within the crypto ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 platforms.\nParadigm's move comes at a time when the crypto industry is navigating through a period of consolidation and regulatory scrutiny. The market has witnessed significant downturns and high-profile collapses, such as the fall of Terra/LUNA ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the once-prominent exchange FTX. However, investors like Paradigm are doubling down on their belief in the long-term potential of digital assets and blockchain technology.\nThe fundraising efforts also highlight the broader trends in the venture capital sphere, where despite the overall slowdown in funding due to economic headwinds, specialized funds with deep expertise in niche areas like crypto continue to attract substantial capital. This dynamic suggests a maturing market where seasoned investors are looking beyond short-term volatility and focusing on foundational technologies that could shape the future of finance and internet infrastructure.\nParadigm's track record and the pedigree of its leadership, including co-founders Fred Ehrsam, former Coinbase executive, and Matt Huang, former Sequoia Capital partner, have been instrumental in garnering investor confidence. Their previous fund's performance, which has backed successful projects and companies in the crypto space, is an encouraging sign for potential backers of the new fund.\nAs the cryptocurrency sector awaits more regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, the successful closure of Paradigm's fund could serve as a bellwether for the industry's health and investor sentiment. It may also pave the way for other investment firms to follow suit and raise significant capital, further propelling the growth and innovation in the crypto domain.\nIn conclusion, Paradigm's ambitious fundraising goal reflects a strong conviction in the transformative power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It marks a significant moment for the ecosystem, which continues to attract serious investment despite the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead.",

Ethereum developers behind Medalla have also set up certain criteria that need to be fulfilled for the alternative blockchain to be unlocked.\nThe test run of the network will be in the hands of the community, and a minimum of 16,385 validators are required for the launch. Each of these users is required to deposit 32 Ether (ETH) coins to access the multi-client testnet. Also, “minimum genesis time” needs to be accomplished, which basically outlines when the earliest launch of ETH 2.0 testnet can be held.\nIf requirements are not fulfilled, Medalla’s launch will be delayed for 48 hours. The multi-client testnet will only launch if the two criteria are met.\nProgress On Unlocking Medalla\nSo far, it was reported that roughly more than 150,000 ETH tokens have been deposited, meaning that Medalla testnet has achieved 30.5% of the total number of validators it needs for a successful launch next week. Ethereum collaborated with blockchain tech company Consensys and DeepWork Studio to release the ETH 2.0 validator launchpad.\nEthereum Announces Its Testnet Strategy\nThe blockchain network told its Ethereum crypto community that the multi-client testnet Medalla, they will continue “fine-tuning the interface” in anticipation of the release of the mainnet. In addition to this, Ethereum also explained that as it was transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum 2.0 will be launched in at least 3 phases to make sure that all aspects are covered methodically before release.\nBy breaking up the phases, a different aspect of Ethereum 2.0 can be focused on at each phase and the mainnet can consequently be perfected.\nPhases of ETH 2.0\nPhases 0, 1, and 2 each outlines a different concept. Phases 0 focuses on all the machinery behind ETH 2.0’s consensus, and it tracks the validators and their transaction balances.\nPhase 1’s main objective is to handle the addition and storage of new and old data associated with ETH 2.0.\nFinally, Phase 2 adds execution to ETH 2.0, and this simply allows programs to be run on top of it.\nCo-Founder Vitalik Pushed for Phase 1\nCo-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin has been actively pushing for phase 1 to begin. The Ethereum mastermind wants to get a better grasp of how phase 1 will work in practice. On Reddit, he said that the \"clients team\" working on Medalla was behind on phase 0, and though that may be the case, they should still start working on phase 1. Buterin justified his strategy, saying:\nEthereum And Bitcoin “Bull Races”\nThis year has been a really good year for Ethereum. With their plans of launching ETH 2.0 mainnet, the blockchain platform has also managed to outrank Bitcoin earlier this month, sitting at approximately $2.5 billion and making it the first time since early 2019 that it has outdone its rival BTC.\nThe latter has however been picking up its pace on the crypto market after months of staying stagnant. Yesterday, it was reported that BTC surged past the $10, 000 mark. BTC as a hedge has also recently been even more of a hot topic, with the depreciation of USD due to economic stimulus packages released by the US government.\nReady, Set, Launch\nWith Medalla testnet set to launch on August 4, the year 2020 has been good for Ethereum. Medalla is to be the last testnet produced by the dominant cryptocurrency platform before ETH 2.0 mainnet is officially in service and open for public use.",

    "title": "How Does MakerDAO Stay Compliant on over 400 Global Partnerships?",
    "summary": "MakerDao has over 400 global partnerships active throughout the world. So how does Maker manage to remain compliant with users in over 120 separate and specifically financially regulated jurisdictions?",
    "content": "MakerDao is the protocol behind Dai, the world’s first decentralized stablecoin and the contemporary success story for decentralized finance (DeFi). The project went live in December 2017, with Dai as the USD stablecoin and Maker functioning as the governance token. In the world of decentralized finance, MakerDao is by far the most popular DeFi protocol running on the Ethereum network and has been steadily increasing traction since its launch. After only a year and a half into production, MakerDao reached its all-time high market cap of $97M on July 9, 2019.\nIn part three of our interview with Gustave Arentoft, Business Development, Dai Speaker, MakerDAO: he talks to Blockchain.News regarding the necessity for decentralized banking for the institutionally unbanked and regulatory requirements for operating across multiple jurisdictions.\nRegulating on the Edges\nMaker has users in over 120 separate and specifically financially regulated jurisdictions across the globe. To regulate a truly decentralized entity, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, at its core to satisfy every local financial compliance protocol is basically “not possible” according to Arentoft. “We regulate where the lending protocols meet the jurisdiction. So with a decentralized product you don’t regulate the core but you regulate on the edges, the edges which meet the specific local jurisdiction.”\nMaker has more than 400 different partnerships globally. These partners are already using DAI and collateralized debt positions (CDP), Arentoft stated that every single time a project is tied to any legal jurisdiction, compliance with local regulation must be made but he explained this process is often simplified by their active partners' foothold in that particular jurisdiction. He said, “For example, one of our partners is Wirex, which is a debit card company, and they have an e-money license in the UK to operate—so that's one way Maker becomes regulated in regards to the UK’s jurisdiction as that company uses our product within the local regulatory guidelines. Regulation is something that we're really on the forefront with and we try to ensure that we won't get ourselves or any of our partners in trouble with regulators.”\nEducation is the Key\nIn regards to regulators, Arentoft believes that they have been labeled as having fairly negative approaches to crypto and token regulation, whereas he feels it is more a matter of education at this point and that it is a necessity for developers to be a part of the growing conversation. On meeting the regulators at the Singapore FinTech Festival, he said, “I felt that they really wanted to learn and explore this space not just reject it.”\nMaker were invited to present on the future of sustainable finance by the Asian Development Bank a week prior to the Singapore FinTech Festival. Arentoft again highlighted that there is an outsider perception that DeFi organizations are met with nothing but vitriol from the central banks who are perceived as only viewing the technology as a threat to their traditional institutions. He stated, “41 central banks were present and what they actually are focused on is that we have the ability to serve people that banks had previously deemed too unprofitable to service. For banks to set up an affiliate abroad is a very expensive process compared to downloading an app on your smartphone.” He added, “If you look at the predicted increasing smartphone adoption rate for the next few years, it will allow us to work together with these banks in areas that require our operations to bank the unbanked—our mission is to help these people after all.”",

    "content": "The UK announced on Monday to accept stablecoins as a valid form of payment and has set plans to make Britain a global hub for crypto-asset technology and investment.\nThe government plans to regulate stablecoins to pave a way for their use in the UK as a legal form of payment and also create conditions for stablecoins issuers and service providers to operate and invest in the UK, the official website of the UK government said.\nThe announcements come as a part of measures taken by the government to turn the UK into a global hub for crypto-assets technology and investment.\nChancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said: \"It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto-asset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country.\"\nStablecoins are crypto-assets intended to maintain a stable value as it is typically pegged to a fiat currency such as the dollar.\n\"With appropriate regulation, they (stablecoins) could provide a more efficient means of payment and widen consumer choice,\" the website said.\nAccording to the website, recognizing the potential of the crypto-asset technology and regulating it can help the UK government ensure financial stability and high regulatory standards. By doing so, the government aims to use them reliably and safely.\n\"We want to see the businesses of tomorrow – and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term,\" Sunak said.\nThe UK also plans to actively explore the benefits of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in UK financial markets, John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said. The DLT allows synchronicity and sharing of data in a decentralized manner to achieve greater efficiency, transparency and resilience.\nThe website also added that \"the government will legislate to establish a financial market infrastructure (FMI) 'Sandbox' that will enable firms to experiment and innovate in providing the infrastructure services that underpin markets, in particular by enabling Distributed Ledger Technology to be tested.\"\nThe government has also planned to initiate a research programme to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of using DLT for sovereign debt instruments.\nFor further development of the crypto-asset market in the UK, the government has plans to review how DeFi loans – where holders of cryptoa-ssets lend them out for a return – are treated for tax purposes, and also to consult on extending the scope of the Investment Manager Exemption to include crypto-assets.\nUK Plans to Mint its NFT\nOther announcements include the creation of a non-fungible token (NFT) in the summer under commission from Sunak; and a Cryptoasset Engagement Group, established and chaired by the Economic Secretary - who will convene \"key figures from the regulatory authorities and industry to advise the government on issues facing the crypto-asset sector\".\nFurther details have yet to be released by the government.",

    "summary": "Arbitrum Decentralized Autonomous Organization approves $23.4 million budget increase for STIP, supporting emerging builders and creating welcoming environment for new projects, raising total budget to 71.4 million ARB tokens.",
    "content": "The Arbitrum DAO, a layer-2 networking system designed to enhance Ethereum blockchain scalability, has recently taken a significant step in expanding its Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP). The DAO, governed by ARB token holders and financed through transaction fees, voted to increase its STIP budget by $23.4 million. This decision was made during a community vote held from November 18 to December 2, 2023.\nThe proposal aimed to provide additional funding for projects that had previously been approved but not financed due to the initial 50 million ARB token cap set for STIP. The recent vote led to the allocation of an additional 21.1 million ARB tokens, equivalent to approximately $23.4 million, thereby expanding the overall STIP budget to 71.4 million ARB tokens.\nThis increased funding will now extend to a total of 56 projects, emphasizing the DAO's commitment to supporting diverse and emerging builders within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The initiative is part of a broader effort to create a conducive environment for new projects and foster innovation and growth on the platform.\nAmong the projects receiving additional funding are Wormhole (1.8 million ARB), Stargate Finance (2 million ARB), and Gains Network (4.5 million ARB). However, due to the imposition of Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements by STIP, PancakeSwap withdrew its request for 2 million ARB.\nThe decision to authorize increased funds was not without controversy. Some members of the Arbitrum DAO argued that a complete second round of funding would have been a more equitable approach to include additional protocols in the incentives program. This sentiment reflects the ongoing debate within the community about the best methods to support and integrate new projects into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nDelegates from the MUX protocol raised concerns about the mixing of projects of varying quality due to the additional funding. However, the majority vote in favor of the proposal underscores the community's preference for immediate action to support a wider range of projects, despite the differing opinions.\nThe Arbitrum DAO's decision to expand its STIP budget signifies its commitment to nurturing a diverse and dynamic ecosystem of projects. By funding additional initiatives, the DAO aims to bolster innovation and growth, ensuring the platform remains competitive and attractive to developers and users alike. This move also highlights the active role of ARB token holders in shaping the future of the Arbitrum ecosystem through their participation in governance decisions.\nOverall, the approval of the increased funds for STIP proposals represents a critical step in Arbitrum's journey towards fostering a thriving and inclusive environment for blockchain innovation and development.",

The Bill is now headed for the Senate for the final vote.\nWhat Do the Blockchain Bills Mean?\nEssentially if the bills are passed, they aim to protect the public from scams and illegitimate projects—leveraging blockchain technology to combat fraud.\nSpecifically, the Digital Taxonomy Act (H.R.2154) provides clarity on the definitions of two terms—'digital asset’ and ‘digital unit’—and place a burden on the Federal Trade Commission to prevent unfair trade practices of both aspects. In addition, the Blockchain Innovation Act (H.R. 8153) also requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to research and present information on how blockchain can be leveraged in consumer protection.\nThe two bills were introduced by Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL) and have been rolled into the Consumer Safety Technology Act which was introduced by Rep. Jerry McNerny (D-CA)—which as mentioned pertains to using AI in consumer safety inspections.\nThe act highlights that remaining competitive with digital tokens and blockchain is critical to maintain American innovation, and obligated the FTC to provide further recommendations limit the abuse of the technology while allowing the United States to remain competitive.\nCongressman Darren Soto said in a release:\nRep.

    "content": "In a bid to improve collaborative testing on private chains, blockchain security technology firm BlockSec has launched the Phalcon Fork toolkit. This new toolkit provides more control to developers and security researchers who are working on testnets, ensuring that testing, analysis, and debugging of transactions can be done more efficiently.\nThe Phalcon Fork allows for the forking of arbitrary transaction positions and block numbers on the Ethereum mainnet, giving users greater control over the work being done on testnets. This allows developers to easily test, analyze, and debug transactions, providing a more streamlined testing process. Additionally, Phalcon Fork provides developers with more control over block information such as Timestamp, BaseFee, and MixDigest, while also retaining services and states from the Ethereum mainnet.\nOne of the key features of the Phalcon Fork is the integrated faucet, which provides free fork network Ether (ETH) to execute transactions on private chains. This makes it easier for developers to test their DeFi contracts on private chains, without having to worry about transaction fees. Additionally, Phalcon Fork provides Fork RPC, a remote procedure call node that can be integrated with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks such as Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix or added to MetaMask.\nAt present, users can only fork from the Ethereum mainnet. However, BlockSec has hinted at future support for additional blockchains such as the BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum. This will allow developers to test their DeFi contracts on a wider range of blockchains, providing more flexibility in their testing processes.\nThe launch of Phalcon Fork follows the successful deployment of the Shapella hard fork on the Ethereum mainnet, which went live on April 12. This upgrade has enabled Ethereum validators to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain, resulting in a positive price action for Ether (ETH). Since April 12, Ether has gained roughly 12% and is currently sitting at $2,092 at the time of writing.\nIn conclusion, the Phalcon Fork provides developers and security researchers with more control over testing, analysis, and debugging of transactions on private chains forked from the Ethereum mainnet. It offers an integrated faucet for free fork network Ether (ETH) and Fork RPC for integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks. With future support for additional blockchains on the horizon, the Phalcon Fork provides greater flexibility in the testing process for developers of DeFi contracts.",

The alternative was developed in-house to provide security for validators who stake their funds. The contract provides an isolated cold wallet for validators to secure their validation process and prevent gas-spending attacks. The contract also offers the ability to recover stakes during emergencies, such as elector upgrades.\nThe contract has been audited by CertiK, a Web3, blockchain, and smart contract security firm, which recently announced a partnership with TON to audit future projects on the network. Orbs has released the single nominator contract to the community as a free, open-source product.\nThe release of the single nominator smart contract is a significant development for validators in the TON blockchain network. The contract offers a secure and independent way for validators to participate in the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, providing enhanced security and protection against gas-spending attacks. The contract's auditing by CertiK adds an extra layer of security and confidence in the product's reliability.\nOrbs is a leading public blockchain infrastructure designed for mass usage applications. The platform aims to provide a scalable, secure, and decentralized infrastructure for developers to build their blockchain applications. Orbs is committed to advancing the adoption of blockchain technology by providing a user-friendly and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications.\nIn conclusion, the release of the single nominator smart contract by Orbs is a significant development for validators in the TON blockchain network. The contract offers enhanced security and protection against gas-spending attacks, allowing validators to participate in the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm in a secure and independent way. Orbs' commitment to advancing the adoption of blockchain technology is demonstrated through the release of this free, open-source product, which is audited by CertiK, adding an extra layer of security and reliability to the contract.",

    "content": "After a fierce debate exploded over how to tax cryptocurrency, a bid to pass a major infrastructure bill worth approximately $1 trillion has stalled in the senate of the United States.\nThe continuous efforts to pass an amphibian infrastructure bill could reshape the dimensions of the cryptocurrency world, as lawmakers exchange views about new tax reporting requirements on several parts of the blockchain system.\nThe Washington Post reported last Friday that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen lobbied the lawmakers directly to keep cryptocurrency tax provisions stronger in the infrastructure bill. It depicts the dedication of the White House to bring cryptocurrency into the extensive tax reporting systems even when the details about the new requirements jeopardise disrupting the fragile infrastructure plan’s political balance.\nA New Requirement on Crypto Brokers\nThe initial tax bill released on Saturday imposed a broad new requirement on crypto brokers to report transactions as part of their tax returns, similar to the enduring requirements for trading conventional assets. The vague definition of “broker” in the original text suggests extending to wallet miners and developers.\nAn amendment from Cynthia Lummis, Pat Toomey, and Sens. Ron Wyden would release miners from any reporting requirements explicitly, but the amendment has not passed yet. A group of lawmakers led by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) has proposed a slightly gruffer compromise that left several cryptocurrency advocates uncomfortable and has attained more support in congress. Advocates are concerned that the varying reporting requirements in the Warner amendment could pave the way to a lasting split among various blockchain technologies.\nA ‘Cold Impact’ on Cryptocurrency\nJust as stockbrokers report their customers' sales to the internal revenue service (IRS), the bill will raise approximately $28 billion over the next decade by updating IRS requirements for the crypto brokers. Pat Toomey, the Republican senator, is concerned, along with other senators, that software developers, crypto miners, and other relevant people would be contingent on the new IRS reporting requirement.\nToomey said that we would be doing a lot of damage if not acquiring this amendment. He also said that we could harm the development of this technology, and I am very concerned about it.\nMeanwhile, the White House claimed that the compromised amendment would reduce tax circumvention in the cryptocurrency market. The administrations believe this provision will extend tax compliance in this evolving finance area and ensure that high-income taxpayers present what they owe under the law.",

    "content": "COVID-19 has not prevented blockchain companies in China from emerging at a dramatic speed.\nBlockchain On the Rise in China\nData from LongHash indicated that new blockchain firms have been emerging at a speedy rate despite the pandemic, and even recorded an all-time high in 2020. The data shows that the biggest number of founded blockchain companies was located in the Guangdong province in Southeast China, with the second largest number originating from the Yunnan province.\nMore than 10 000 new blockchain firms were established in the first 7 months of 2020, and with the rate at which new firms are emerging, the blockchain industry in China is set to boom at an all-time high. According to expert reports, China is set to surpass 2018’s total number of established blockchain companies, recorded at 18,500 new startups.\nBlockchain for Capital\nAs of now, there are around 84,400 registered blockchain companies and of this amount, only 29,340 are in operation. Data from the Laboratory of Internet Financial Security Technology of the National Internet Emergency Center revealed that contrary to popular belief, a lot of these companies proclaiming to operate under the name of blockchain do not leverage the decentralized ledger and do not possess chain ownership and.\nRather, the majority of these registered startups disguised as blockchain firms were actually shell corporations aiming to capitalize on the increasing popularity of blockchain. The underlying goal of many of these companies is to draw the attention of corporate tech companies, in the hopes that the latter will buy them out.\nThe majority of the blockchain companies in China have been found to be registered under a small capital, the average amount estimated to be of 5,000 yuan. This translates to roughly $717 USD.\nBenefits of Blockchain During COVID-19\nWith the surcharge of the healthcare system worldwide due to COVID-19, blockchain technology has been increasingly leveraged for efficient and reliable digital health services. A lot of firms have come up with strategies leveraging blockchain technology to aid the healthcare system and make a difference in this global medical upset. Blockchain technology has been used by the healthcare system to provide faster, safer digital services for online insurance claims, educational content, medical transactions, and much more.\nTop Choice of European Blockchain Firms: Ethereum\nAs blockchain technology is being increasingly leveraged for its features and its open-source aspect, it is increasingly common for startups to employ this type of technology. A very popular ecosystem employed by many firms is the Ethereum blockchain.\nEthereum has been reported to dominate European blockchain enterprises, and it has come a long way since its establishment in 2015. Many companies leverage Ethereum blockchain ecosystem for its robustness, scalability and overall stable architecture.\nThe network recently launched Medalla, which is to be the last testnet before the adoption of Ethereum 2.0 mainnet, which will operate on a Proof-of-Stake consensus rather than a traditional Proof-of-Work protocol.",

    "summary": "Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) is a low-cost, regulated ETF for U.S. investors, offering a traditional route to investing in bitcoin. With a 0% management fee for the first six months, BITB could pave the way for more cryptocurrency-based investment products.",
    "content": "The recent launch of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) marks a significant milestone in the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial markets. On January 11, 2024, Bitwise Asset Management, renowned as the largest crypto index fund manager in the United States, commenced trading of its first spot bitcoin ETF, BITB. This event heralds a new chapter in investment options for U.S. investors, offering an accessible route to investing in bitcoin through a regulated, traditional exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe BITB: A Low-Cost Investment Vehicle\nOne of the most notable features of the BITB is its management fee structure. Initially set at 0.20%, the fee is among the lowest in the current market for spot bitcoin ETFs. Furthermore, in a move to attract investors, Bitwise has decided to reduce the fee to 0% for the first six months for the initial $1 billion in assets under management. This strategic pricing positions BITB competitively, potentially influencing the broader market of cryptocurrency-based ETFs.\nRisks and Considerations\nAs with any investment, there are risks associated with BITB. The fund is nondiversified, meaning it may hold fewer portfolio securities compared to other products. This could lead to higher volatility in the fund's value. Additionally, being a new fund, it presents a recency risk with limited historical data for investors to consider.\nBITB is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. Therefore, shareholders do not have certain protections typically associated with shares in registered investment companies. Moreover, the value of the ETF is closely tied to the price of bitcoin, which is known for its high volatility. Potential investors should carefully evaluate their ability to withstand significant fluctuations in the value of their investment.\nThe Bitwise Ecosystem\nBitwise Asset Management has been a pioneering force in the crypto investment space. Over the past six years, the company has developed a diverse range of investment products, including the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Web3 ETF (BWEB). Their products cater to a wide range of investors, from financial advisors to family offices and institutional investors, providing comprehensive access to crypto markets.\nFurthermore, Bitwise has pledged to allocate 10% of the profits from BITB to support Bitcoin open-source development. This initiative underscores the company's commitment to the growth and sustainability of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nThe Broader Implications\nThe launch of BITB is a significant development in the broader context of cryptocurrency acceptance in regulated financial markets. It follows a longstanding debate and anticipation around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States. BITB's entry into the market could pave the way for more cryptocurrency-based investment products, offering traditional investors a more familiar and regulated path to investing in digital assets.",

Ted Cruz expressed his concerns about the proposed crypto taxation and said on Saturday that:\nHowever, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called the legislation too \"hasty\" and said that this is not the time for US legislators to \"choose technological winners or losers\".\nThe CEO of Twitter and Square, Jack Dorsey, stated that a hearing could be held in response to the proposal made by Ron Wyden, Cynthia Lummis, and Pat Toomey on the \"cryptocurrency broker\" to clarify the definitions.

Tim Welsh of the California based consultancy group Nexus believes Schwab’s decision is based on an unwillingness to disturb the status quo. He spoke out claiming that, “Unless Schwab’s biggest advisors demand that they do something, they will continue to sleep-walk through innovation.”\nLex Sokolin — global co-head for financial technology at blockchain software firm ConsenSys — has a far less critical view of the firm’s slow-burning strategy.

However, this latter specification lags behind the hash rate claimed by leading miners on the market.\nHash rate refers to the speed of mining. It is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. It is measured in units of second, meaning how many calculations per second can be performed.\nAccording to reports, Bitmain’s Antminer S19 and S19 Pro deliver between 95 to 110 TH/s while MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M30S produces up to 112 TH/s of hashing potential.

    "content": "InvestHK announces core events of extended StartmeupHK Festival 2020\nInvest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (January 20) announced details of next month’s StartmeupHK Festival, its influential annual showcase of what’s new and what’s next in the world of start-ups. Entering its fifth year, the StartmeupHK Festival this year has been extended to six days and features seven core events that will present the latest ideas, trends and innovation to an audience from around the world.\nThe key themes this year include changing lifestyle and retail and logistics innovation technology, smart city, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, e-sports, property tech, environment and sustainability, developing entrepreneurial talent through education and incubation, investing in start-ups, and co-innovation between start-ups and corporates. The event will also see the finals of the global Jumpstarter and WHub start-up pitching competitions.\nThe StartmeupHK Festival 2020 will run from February 10 to 15 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai and, on its final day, in Tsuen Wan. An international mix of more than 300 speakers from 54 countries or territories will discuss their experience and know-how in a range of panel sessions, fireside chats, keynotes and presentations. The festival attendance is set to exceed 17,000 delegates.\nThe signature event will be the StartmeupHK Forum on Day 2, co-hosted by InvestHK and Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, when high-profile speakers in keynotes and fireside chats will shine a light on the city’s investment landscape for start-ups and scale-ups, solving some of the world’s most pressing environmental issues and empowering women in innovation.\n“This year’s festival is set against a backdrop of remarkable growth in Hong Kong’s start-up ecosystem. It demonstrates the city’s appeal as a place for start-ups and how welcoming it is to them,” Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Charles Ng said. “The number of start-ups in 2019 reached 3,184, up 21 per cent year on year. Importantly, the number of people working in the start-up sector grew 31 per cent to 12,478.”\nCiting InvestHK research on the city’s start-up ecosystem, Mr Ng pointed out that about a third of the start-up founders are from outside Hong Kong, with the United States, Mainland China and the United Kingdom being the leading three places of origin.\nDay 1 (February 10) will feature the Connected Cities Conference, hosted by KPMG, which will focus on innovations for the next generation of city living. Global and regional speakers from academia and business and leading entrepreneurs will showcase examples of a number of smart and connected cities and technologies from around the world including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance a city’s liveability, workability and sustainability. A new thought leadership survey report will be launched to provide insights on the future of Hong Kong as a smart city.\nDays 2 and 3 (February 11 and 12) will combine three major offerings: Jumpstarter, organised by Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund; Connected Retail Experiences, organised by Bailey Communications; and the above-mentioned StartmeupHK Forum, co-hosted by InvestHK and Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund.\nJumpstarter is a two-day event that’s both a global pitch competition involving start- ups from around the world that will have its grand finale in the event and also a first-of- its-kind start-up conference focused exclusively on advocating entrepreneurship, showcasing quality start-ups and providing high-impact networking opportunities among start-ups, investors and corporates. It will include keynotes, panel discussions, experiential zones and workshops.\nConnected Retail Experiences is a two-day conference for retailers and brand owners who recognise the rapidly changing nature of retail and are looking for solutions to help them reposition their business. It will look at the technology and innovation behind seamless branded retail experiences across all channels, along with how retailers are able to harness the power of data lakes of information that they hold about their customers’ purchasing habits.\nOn Day 4 (February 13) is the Lifestyle Tech Conference, hosted by Jumpstart Media, in which attendees can learn about trends from the most promising start-ups, investors, corporates and change makers disrupting peoples’ bodies, purchases, downtime, technologies and aspirations, and necessities. It will provide new meaning to everyday life and key insights into the way we live. There’s also the opportunity to check out the start-up zone and test gaming skills in the e-sports corner.\nDay 5 (February 14) will have the Startup Impact Summit 2020, hosted by WHub. As the event title suggests, this is about creating impact, and the summit will bring together the local and international tech communities for a related showcase. It will condense 365 days of start-up life into one day, with multiple tracks, stages, workshops and resources for start-ups to scale their business. The summit this year will feature a brand new global start-up competition, co-organised by AngelHub and WHub, which will bring together prominent start-ups, investors and corporates across Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as Asia.\nAlongside its Startup Impact Summit, WHub will also launch a new white paper that focuses on the start-up ecosystems in the 11 cities that combine to form the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\nThis year’s StartmeupHK Festival has an extra day on February 15 that will take delegates away from the main venue in Wan Chai to Tsuen Wan, where the Ecosystem Summit hosted by the Mills Fabrica will take place. This half-day event will focus on ways to foster and grow the start-up ecosystem in Hong Kong and globally. A series of panel sessions and roundtables will look at developing entrepreneurial talent through education and incubation, transforming corporates through innovation, and taking Hong Kong start-ups global and promoting the city as a global innovation hub.\nThe Head of StartmeupHK at InvestHK, Ms Jayne Chan, said, “Our need for technological solutions for global challenges has never been greater. This year’s extended programme spotlights the latest technologies and innovations that are improving lives in a sustainable way, and hopefully contributing in the bigger picture. The festival looks at the way we live our lives and offers a real variety of ideas and technologies that can help us to do things better. It will showcase how Hong Kong as a leading innovation hub globally, playing its part in creating a better, smarter world.”\nTo follow the latest start-up developments in Hong Kong, please go to the website www.startmeup.hk.\nInvestHK is the department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government responsible for attracting foreign direct investment and supporting overseas and Mainland businesses to set up or expand in Hong Kong.

    "content": "The ambitious DeFi liquidity project, Paradigm labs is shutting down its operations citing an inability to build a resilient business within the DEX ecosystem.\nAccording to the post on Medium today, Liam Kovatch CEO and Founder of Paradigm Labs stated, “After almost two years of active research and development, our team has come to the decision that without significant product-market fit and limited resources to pursue emergent opportunities, the kind of success we envisioned for Paradigm Labs is unlikely.\"\nWhere is the Niche?\nThe project began in 2018 with the impetus to enhance liquidity within the DEX ecosystem and was believed to be a gamechanger for decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency.\nIn the announcement, Kovatch said, “The reasoning behind our failure to carve a viable niche in the DEX marketplace is multifaceted, and ultimately a result of both factors within and outside of our control. We have taken some time to reflect on our journey and would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the challenges we faced that ultimately forced us to make this difficult decision.”\nAs outlined by Kovatch, the timing, hesitation to pivot, and capital constraints were at the heart of the decision to dissolve the company.\nIn terms of timing, the CEO believes they were unlucky as the decentralized exchange space witnessed a number of developments “such as the launch of Uniswap, the establishment of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement and more,” that made the DEX space incredible fluid and challenging for an organization like Paradigm Labs to navigate.\nDuring their time, Paradigm Labs had two different products on offer - Zaidan and Kosu. The former was far more effective than the latter and it was a failure of Paradigm labs to turn their back on Kosu and focus on Zaidan that accelerated their fate.\nWhat do users do now?\nThe post instructed users who are staking ZRX with Zaidan’s War Chest to deposit their stake with other validators as they will no longer be active on Paradigm Labs after March 16.\nThe project will be legally dissolving by the end of the month. The Discord Channel will still be available for users until the 1st of April, 2020.\nImage via Shutterstock",

    "content": "Following concerns from the Group of Seven (G7) nations, Japan has requested crypto exchanges to cancel transactions of crypto assets that are subject to asset-freeze sanctions against Russia and Belarus, Reuters reported citing national officials.\nConcerns among the G7 economies have been growing as they believe that the Russian government is using cryptocurrencies to tackle financial sanctions imposed upon the country for invading Ukraine.\nLast Friday, the G7 released a statement saying Western nations “will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth.”\nCurrently, there are 31 crypto exchanges in Japan, according to an industry association.\nAccording to Reuters, Japan’s request also came following the issuance of new guidance by the US Treasury Department that has asked US-based cryptocurrency firms to stop transactions with sanction targets.\n“We decided to make an announcement to keep the G7 momentum alive,” said a senior official at Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA). “The sooner the better.”\nIn a joint statement, Japan’s FSA and the Ministry of Finance said that strong measures will be imposed against the transfer of funds using crypto assets that would be in violation of the sanctions.\nThe FSA further added that illegal payments to sanctioned targets will be punished with three years prison sentences or a 1 million yen ($8,487.52) fine. Payments under surveillance also include crypto assets - such as cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens - the FSA added.\nRussia has seen the further suspension of payment methods due to its war with Ukraine.\nAccording to a March 7, 2022, report by Blockchain.News, more payment operators have followed the orders of sanctions issued by the U.S.\nAmerican Express, Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal have announced the suspension of their operations in Russia in protest of the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\nThe report added that four operators stated that cards issued by them would no longer function at shops or ATMs in Russia and that also means customers will no longer be able to use their Russian cards abroad or for international payments.\nAnother report by Blockchain.News stated that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes cryptocurrencies are emerging as the lifeline for Russians as the nation faces heavy sanctions.\nArmstrong was quoted as saying: “some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed. Many of them likely oppose what their country is doing, and a ban would hurt them, too. That said, if the US government decides to impose a ban, we will of course follow those laws.”\nArmstrong also pointed out that banning Russians from using crypto exchanges is not possible as the law does not warrant it. He said that Coinbase is “not preemptively banning all Russians from using Coinbase. We believe everyone deserves access to basic financial services unless the law says otherwise.”\nThe war has caused panic among Russians and Ukrainians who are using crypto to shield their money.",

As a result, blockchain technology is continuously being deployed in many institutions of higher learning for immutable storage across the globe.\nFor instance, as reported by Blockchain.News on Nov 21, following concerns raised by the US Embassy that some employees and students were applying for visas using fake academic certificates, the Indian state of Telangana made a broad move of addressing this menace by deploying blockchain in academic certificates granted by Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH).",

    "content": "The crypto industry has witnessed a massive downturn, losing about $2 trillion in value since hitting a peak in November.\nSeveral crypto exchanges are struggling following the Federal Reserve's increase in interest rates to curb inflation earlier this year.\nSince investors have begun to shun risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, major crypto companies such as Coinbase have announced layoffs of many employees. Coinbase had massively increased in size during the bull market.\nCrypto companies in total have announced more than 1,800 job cuts since early June, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The job cuts have created an atmosphere of uncertainty in the formerly growing crypto industry.\nSome of the top companies that have executed layoffs in recent months are as follows:\nGemini\nOn June 2, Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss said through a blog post that the crypto exchange was laying off approximately 10% of its workforce.\nCrypto.com\nOn June 10, Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, said about 5% of its workforce would be part of the “targeted reductions”, or 260 jobs would be removed.\nDuring the crypto bull market, Crypto.com spent $700 million to put its name on the Los Angeles Lakers’ arena. The company also ran a Super Bowl ad featuring LeBron James.\nBlockFi\nOn June 13, crypto trading and lending platform BlockFi said that it would reduce its staff members by 20%. The company cited the dramatic shift in the macroeconomic environment as the reason for the layoffs.\nAccording to CEO Zac Prince's tweet thread announcing the layoffs, BlockFi had grown to over 850 in employees number in mid-June from about 150 at the end of 2020.\nBlockFi has struck a deal with crypto exchange FTX to sustain its business. The deal includes a $400 million credit line and an option to be acquired for as much as $240 million.\nCoinbase\nOn June 14, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that it is slashing its workforce by 1,100 employees, or about 18% of its staff. According to the WSJ, Coinbase is one of the single growth firms of the crypto boom. Chief Executive Brian Armstrong said, “our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market.”\nShares of Coinbase have plunged more than 71% this year, according to FactSet data.\nCompass Mining\nOn July 7, Compass Mining said via a blog post that 15% of its workforce would get laid off. The company also said announced that compensation for executives would be reduced.\nAccording to the bitcoin mining company, their business “grew too quickly” but had to cut spending now due to uncertain market conditions.\nOpenSea\nOn July 14, nonfungible tokens (NFT) marketplace OpenSea announced that it is cutting a fifth of its staff. It cited the crash in cryptocurrency prices as the reason behind employee layoffs. According to OpenSea, it now has 230 employees, suggesting about 57 people were laid off.\nBlockchain.com\nOn July 21, cryptocurrency exchange Blockchain.com announced that it is laying off one-quarter of its workforce. Collapsed crypto hedge-fund manager Three Arrows Capital had taken credits of more than $300 million from this trading platform.",

    "content": "Roger Svensson, Associate Professor of the Institute of Industrial Economics, suggests Bitcoin (BTC) is unsuitable as a medium of flat money for international currency. The scholar told the Financial Times Monday.\nEl Salvador President revealed last week that he intends to introduce a bill to legalise BTC as its legal tender to become the first country to accept BTC for boosting its economy. Svensson argues that BTC does not meet any primary conditions as an international currency. Firstly, BTC volatility is much greater than other dominant currency in history, such as the British pound or the US dollars.\nHe also thinks the price and the relative values of BTC are too fluctuating and unstable, which is a disadvantage to international trading. Also, the transaction cost is high enough due to its capacity of transaction system is limited and time-consuming within a period to meet the market’s needs.\nWithout a guarantee from an issuer, its political risk cannot be neglected if any or more than one government or regime prohibits the transaction of BTC. For instance, China regulatory bodies banned banks and financial firms from providing crypto transaction services recently.\nMoney is considered as the lubricant in the economy. However, Svensson criticises that BTC does not have this monetary function to act as a medium to store value or reduce transaction costs because BTC is only accepted within a limited group. However, BTC is treated as one of the cryptocurrencies. Still, anonymous characteristics may lead to a difficulty for the third party to trace back and recognise who is behind those transactions, which is risky to commit crimes, such as money laundering or tax evasion behaviour.\nFurthermore, the energy consumed by BTC mining is environmentally unfriendly and high demanding to the “currency issuance”.\nThe trading of BTC recently was undergoing like a roller coaster. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has used to suggest on Twitter by accepting crypto as a way of payment but withdraw himself later, the price of BTC was experiencing a considerable fluctuation.",

    "content": "There were big moves in the US House of Representatives on Thursday as two new crypto-related bills were discussed among the House Agriculture Committee as the United States moves forward with crypto regulation.\nOne bill is focused on identifying what types of cryptocurrencies are considered securities, while the second is aimed at building a regulatory infrastructure around the several cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe Securities Clarity Act has been amended to make a distinction in securities law between investment contracts and various financial instruments. A new breath of life into the regulatory system could be bullish for institutional investors and the broader crypto community.\nRepresentative Mike Conaway and The Blockchain Caucus also brought forward the Digital Commodity Exchange Act to the House Agriculture Committee. This would put crypto exchanges under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, which answers to the Agriculture Committee.\nThis would be a landmark event for cryptocurrency traders as the registration would dramatically simplify payments and streamline licensing for regional exchanges. Inter-state payments have been notoriously problematic of late. Crypto payment services require separate licenses to operate in different states which are slowing down adoption and restricting opportunity.\nFor cryptocurrency to be widely considered as a commodity would be a pivotal moment for any U.S citizens holding crypto assets.\nIf the new bills were to be successful, it would see retail crypto investment fall under the many of the same regulatory categories as commodities, however, there is still room within the agreement to allow for more complex and specific use cases in the future.",

    "content": "China’s blockchain initiative is going ahead full steam, but local and provincial officials are facing some resistance from stakeholders who are not enthusiastic about sharing their data.\nChinese local governments are facing delays when attempting to implement their blockchain applications as stakeholders are trying to hold on to their privately-owned data, reported media site CCTV Beijing.\nBlockchain technology has become a hot item in China over the years, and the rise in research, development, and implementation of local governments has surged following Chinese Leader Xi Jinping announcement last October that the country must strive to become the global blockchain leader.\nData is not Free\nIn China, there are currently more than 30 local governments developing blockchain infrastructure and applications. According to the CCTV report on June 10, the central aim is to leverage blockchain technology to enhance local governance capabilities.\nHowever, many of these local government blockchain projects have been abandoned in the last two years as they are unable to obtain the necessary supporting data from local stakeholders.\nA government staff member of one of the local blockchain projects, Zhang Desheng told the Chinese media that there was no clear policy framework for the projects, which created huge gaps in communication between government's employees and private stakeholders. They said, “The data required by the entire blockchain management platform involves local banks, insurance, telecommunications, and other departments, some departments are willing to provide data, and some are not.\"\nVice president of China Digital Asset Research Institute, Yan Meng, who has long shown concern regarding blockchain development believes that data is not free and neither government nor private sectors would be willing to donate. As such, Meng thinks that any requested data should be purchased.\nMeng shared, “The basic logic of most blockchain applications is problematic. If we want to make a blockchain, we first need to collect data from different government departments or some different companies on the blockchain.” He continued, “The advantage of blockchains is that they cannot be tampered with and easy to trace. This idea sounds good, but in practice, which department or enterprise is going to be willing to donate their data for free? And then put it on a chain so that everyone can view it? The core problem of this resistance is that data especially for the government and enterprises is their main resource. At least pay for it, these problems weren’t taken it into account, it is the biggest problem at the moment.\"",

    "content": "JBS, a leading Brazilian meatpacker, has resorted to blockchain technology to prompt the traceability of tens of thousands of cattle it processes daily.\nWith this approach, the company hopes to shed light on its livestock source following mounting pressure from investors and Amazon activists about getting cattle from illegally deforested lands.\nTracing cattle throughout their lives\nThe Sao Paulo-based company has been criticized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for not being at the forefront of ensuring that it is not supplied with cattle from unlawfully deforested Amazonian lands. Additionally, the Brazilian government has found itself in hot soup from the international community for the severe destruction of the Amazon rainforest.\nJBS seeks to avert this problem by unveiling a digital ledger, which will be instrumental in tracing its livestock origin. It also intends to give suppliers the power to monitor individual supply chains in the next five years. The ledger is to be audited by external parties. As per the announcement:\nDriving the sustainability agenda\nInvestors have lauded this development as it is a significant step forward in driving the sustainability agenda forward.\nPetterson Vale, an agricultural consultant in the Amazon, said:\nBlockchain technology is continuously being adopted in the food industry for its transparency and traceability solutions. For instance, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations recently reported that disruptive technologies like blockchain are game-changers in making the global seafood sector more sustainable and profitable.\nAs a result, this cutting-edge technology can offer fishers more precise weather forecasts and satellite positioning, which will make its operations more predictable, safer, and more accurate.",

ZeroSync notes that the ZK-Proof tools do not require consensus changes or additional trust assumptions for the Bitcoin network and its users.\nThe organization is building a software development kit that will allow developers to generate custom validity proof for specific use cases without requiring in-depth domain expertise. The kit will enable users to implement ZK-proofs for specific use cases while also ensuring compatibility with Bitcoin's rules and regulations.\nZeroSync's tool is currently in the prototype state but has the ability to prove the validity of individual assumed valid blocks, which verify all Bitcoin rules except for scripts. The team also has a working in-browser demo verifier for STARK proofs of Bitcoin blocks.\nZeroSync is using the Cairo programming language, pioneered by StarkWare, to create STARK-provable programs for computations. The organization is building a client for fast initial block download and implementing the first complete proof of Bitcoin consensus. The client will allow users to sync a full node without making code changes to Bitcoin core.\nGeometry and StarkWare initially funded the ZeroSync Association, but the organization is establishing a nonprofit entity to enable ongoing development and maintenance from stakeholders within the Bitcoin community.\nOverall, ZeroSync's tooling will revolutionize the validation process of the Bitcoin blockchain, bringing ZK-proofs to the forefront of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The use of ZK-proofs will enable Bitcoin users to validate the state of the network more efficiently and securely, without having to trust third-party verifiers.",

    "content": "Thailand Blockchain Community Initiative (BCI) has joined hands with IBM to extend the scope and reach of the blockchain-powered electronic letter of guarantee (eLG) platform to businesses of all sizes. Since its inception in late 2019, the platform has handled guarantee letters worth nearly $300 million.\nTime is of the essence\nThe eLG platform’s popularity is founded on the slashed timeframe of less than a day it uses in the issuance of guarantee letters if a buyer defaults. The manual process takes commercial banks in Thailand approximately nine days because of the negotiations between the buyer, seller, and bank. As per the announcement:\nThe seller might also find him/herself at a fix without recourse because the manual procedure faces the danger of forgery of paper documents. The BCI blockchain platform has stepped in and averted these predicaments because 22 banks and 15 companies presently utilized it for enterprise auctions, payment obligations, and other domestic trading processes.\nThrough the new partnership, more capabilities like disaster recovery and multi-region high availability will be availed. Others are hybrid cloud and multi-vendor abilities.\nTransaction costs reduced by 200%\nReportedly, the eLG platform is designed to minimize the likelihood of fraud and errors for all parties involved. As a result:\nThe BCI sees the letter of guarantee as just the first service offered by the eLG blockchain platform as more products are scheduled to be added in the near future. This is because it is aligned with the roadmap of utilizing a hybrid deployment model for global expansion. Silawat Santivisat, the chairman of the BCI board, noted:\nLast month, Thailand’s Central Bank, the Bank of Thailand, leveraged the power of blockchain technology to launch a platform for government bond savings issuance. It noted that the blockchain-based platform would improve investor’s buying experience, boost operational efficiency, and reduce the overall cost of operations.",

    "content": "With Ethereum 2.0’s first phase (Phase 0) anticipated to launch on December 1, it appears that there is still a lot of Ether (ETH) missing for the blockchain upgrade to happen.\nIn order for Ethereum 2.0 to come into play, a minimum of 32 Ether per validator needs to be locked into the deposit contract. This translates to roughly $14,825.00 per validator or staking pool, per Ether’s current price on CoinMarketCap. In anticipation of Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0, which will feature a beacon chain, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has dedicated 3,200 ETH to Ethereum 2.0, which translates roughly to $1.4 million in today’s prices.\nHowever, a huge chunk of ETH investments is still missing for the blockchain upgrade to happen. On-chain data analytics tracking smart contract deposits have reported that only 18.6% of needed ETH has been locked in as of now. Per the source:\nFor Ethereum 2.0’s phase 0 upgrade to launch successfully, a total of over 524,000 ETH needs to be locked in by validators before November 24 – 7 days before the anticipated release date. If that is not accomplished, plans for Ethereum 2.0 mainnet’s genesis will once again be delayed.\nValidator participation has been an ongoing issue on Ethereum’s testnets, namely Medalla and Spadina. Both testnets have seen lower than expected participation levels, but Ethereum developers have been hoping that it would not be an issue on ETH 2.0, as real Ether will be at stake, so to speak.\nWhat's at stake on Ethereum 2.0 mainnet\nEthereum 2.0 mainnet is expected to launch on December 1, if all goes well. Though phase 0 will not operate entirely according to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, it will be the first step in transitioning towards a pure PoS model.\nAs opposed to a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, the underlying model behind Bitcoin, a proof-of-stake consensus model will depend on a staker to validate new transactions.\nThe staker will be determined based on the amount of tokens they have locked into the deposit contracts. More stakes will translate to higher rewards and privileges. If a given investor does not have enough Ether to stake on Ethereum 2.0 mainnet, staking pools are always a viable option, which will enable multiple stakeholders to combine their resources and earn block rewards on the new blockchain.\nEthereum 2.0 is set to launch in three phases so that the chain can be perfected bit by bit. The current Ethereum blockchain, which follows a PoW consensus model, will also operate in parallel with ETH 2.0 for the time being. Scalability is also expected to be improved on the new blockchain.\nWith the mainnet’s anticipated launch, Ether may surge even more, as more traders onboard Ethereum in anticipation of its success.\nCurrently, ETH has surpassed the $400 mark as expected and is trading at $463,31 on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing.",

Specifically, OFAC claimed the crypto mixer benefited North Korea's Lazarus Group and that the platform has been used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto since its launch.\nLast week, TempleDAO, a protocol staking platform, suffered a hack on one of its staking vaults. As seen on Etherscan, the hacker made away with 1,830 ETH, which was roughly $2.3 million at the time.\nNotably, this hack comes amid the rise of cryptocurrency hacks this month. According to new data from Chainanalysis, October 2022 is the month with the most hacking activity ever.\nThe data averred roughly 11 hacks amounting to $718 million happened this month alone. Chainanalysis stated, \"At this rate, 2022 will likely surpass 2021 as the biggest year for hacking on record.\"\nLast week, trading and lending platform Mango Market suffered an exploit which happened via an oracle price manipulation attack.

This marks a pivotal moment for the platform as it streamlines its offerings to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. As Sushi continues to evolve its services, it has initiated the last call for liquidity providers to withdraw their assets from the Trident Pools before the deprecation deadline on March 15, 2024.\nThe Evolution of Sushi's AMM Platform\nThe Trident framework was launched with the promise of offering an improved Automated Market Maker (AMM) design, featuring the Constant Product Pool, lower gas fees, and integration with BentoBox for better efficiency. In May 2023, Sushi V3 AMM was introduced as the next iteration of this platform, paving the way for the deprecation of Trident Pools.\nUrgent Call to Action for Liquidity Providers\nSushi has made an urgent call to its users to withdraw their liquidity from Trident Pools by the specified deadline to avoid any potential issues. After March 15, 2024, the user interface (UI) for Trident Pools will be discontinued, leaving smart contract interactions or manual support as the only methods for withdrawal, which could result in delays.\nMigrating to Sushi V3 AMM\nFor liquidity providers interested in continuing their participation with Sushi, the platform is encouraging a migration to the more efficient Sushi V3 AMM. To aid this transition, Sushi has made available detailed guides, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and dedicated support channels to assist users throughout the migration process.\nImplications for the DeFi Ecosystem\nThe deprecation of Trident Pools is both a reflection of the natural progression of DeFi platforms and a reminder of the importance of user engagement in maintaining the health of decentralized ecosystems. Sushi's proactive approach in guiding users through this transition highlights the platform's commitment to user-centric development and innovation.\nPreparing for the Future\nAs the DeFi landscape continues to mature, Sushi's actions underscore the need for continuous adaptation and improvement. The platform's focus on enhancing efficiency and usability through its V3 AMM indicates a forward-thinking strategy aimed at securing its position as a leading player in the DeFi space.\nIn light of this announcement, Sushi has reasserted its dedication to delivering a seamless DeFi experience. As the March 15 deadline approaches, users are urged to take the necessary steps to transition their assets and continue their DeFi journey with Sushi's evolving ecosystem.",

    "content": "It seems like billionaire Mark Cuban has changed his view on cryptocurrencies as he recently revealed that he owns some bitcoins. This comes as a surprise because he was quoted one month ago, saying that he does not hold any crypto.\nMark Cuban is the owner of Dallas Mavericks, which plays in the NBA and also a notable investor. Dallas Mavericks in August 2019, announced that it would partner with BitPay and will thus accept Bitcoin for merchandise and tickets.\nCuban appeared on The Pomp Podcast, where he was hosted by Anthony Pompliano. It is on this show that he estimated the value of Bitcoins that his team had accumulated since the announcement of the partnership.\nTaking about Bitcoin, Cuban is heard saying, “We have put it out for the Mavericks. We did it originally four years ago, but no one bought anything. We have now decided to accept Bitcoin”. He continues, “Go buy everything in Bitcoin. I am okay with that. I think we have brought in $130 worth of Bitcoins, and that is all that I own.”\nCuban argues that the dependency of Bitcoin on fiat currency is one of the greatest barriers to its widespread adoption. He argues that at the moment, you have to convert Bitcoin to fiat currency to spend it. In his previous interview with Kevin O’Leary, Cuban pointed out some challenges of cryptocurrencies such as difficulties in spending crypto, widespread understanding, and onboarding challenges as some of the reasons why he does not hold cryptocurrencies.\nStatements from investors such as Cuban have, in the past, affected the prices of Bitcoin against fiat currencies.

    "summary": "Bitcoin may be a sufficiently stable currency for El Salvador and its economy to rely upon. But this is a very small country from the point of view of the size of the economy, which will unlikely offset the global adoption of Bitcoin.",
    "content": "El Salvador is a unique example of Bitcoin adoption and a very fertile ground for Bitcoin to thrive on. The country lost its national currency in the early 2000s, and the current national currency there is the US dollar. El Salvador’s economy is weak, and much of the cash flow is coming from the expats who left for other countries in search for better-paid work.\nIn this situation, Bitcoin may be a sufficiently stable currency for El Salvador and its economy to rely upon. But this is a very small country from the point of view of the size of the economy, which will unlikely offset the global adoption of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, we can see continued predispositions for a growing adoption of Bitcoin around the world. The interstate commerce volumes have grown several times since the early 2000s, and electronic payments are becoming an ordinary thing.\nWhy Bitcoin still has room for improvement\nSome technological issues, however, make Bitcoin not a very practicable solution for retail payments. The proof-of-work consensus mechanism undermines Bitcoin’s transaction throughput. As a result, you often have to wait for your transaction to be processed for 10-30 minutes. Clearly, that is not acceptable for retail payments. Besides that, Bitcoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency that can easily change its price by 5% to 10% and even more in a single day.\nThis creates another issue for the merchants: they will have to change the price of their merchandise very swiftly, sometimes several times per day, which may cause major inconvenience for the business model. It will also require fast crypto-to-fiat conversion on the merchant’s side for effective business performance - if businesses carry on operating in fiat currencies, of course.\nHow to tackle Bitcoin’s flaws\nYes, we can pay for pizza or coffee with Bitcoin: PayPal, for example, has already allowed American residents to do so. As a method of paying for goods, Bitcoin cannot yet manage without the participation of traditional money, though. Bitcoin’s effective exchange rate is calculated at the time of purchase, the end user’s balance in Bitcoin depletes and the merchant is paid in USD or another fiat currency. In this method, the service provider takes on the volatility risk.\nAnother solution offered for solving the technological problems Bitcoin has is the second-layer Lightning Network that can process peer-to-peer transactions outside its blockchain. It has its own system of nodes that can create channels between two Bitcoin wallets.\nThe transactions occurring in those channels would not go into Bitcoin’s blockchain, which could offload the main Bitcoin network. Also, transactions in Lightning Network occur very quickly and cost much less than the ones on the blockchain.\nHowever, there are some serious issues which may compromise this network's performance and security: low incentives for LN nodes and malicious attacks through channel congestion.\nWill Bitcoin go to the next level?\nEl Salvador may be the first to tread the road to Bitcoin adoption as legal tender, but it is still questionable whether this trend would expand to other countries. In the first place, Bitcoin was unlikely ever designed to be used as a means of everyday payment.\nWhile the situation is the way it is, Bitcoin may become more usable in large international money transfers but remain not very effective in retail trade.\nThe greater advantage of Bitcoin is in being used as a store of value - there is a reason it is often referred to as “digital gold”, after all. Traditional gold is considered a reliable store of wealth, but you won’t exactly see anyone bring a bar of gold to a coffee shop to pay for a cup of latte. It is not a convenient way of making payments in everyday life, which are usually small in volume, conducted frequently and need to be done swiftly.\nWhile we see a growing volume of BTC payments in the IT world, most people still have no experience with cryptocurrency transfers. So, it is hard to picture the masses suddenly adopting this novel payment method, as such global paradigm shifts take time.\nIt is important to continuously educate people on the benefits of new solutions. And the more people understand the benefits, the more retailers will be ready to use Bitcoin as a payment means. The growing number of participants in this market will blur the boundaries between the crypto and traditional economies and will make us look for new, interesting solutions. Paying for coffee with Bitcoin will most likely become a new reality.",

This consortium promotes trusted use of fiat-backed stablecoins and as a Bain Expert Advisor in the digital assets space.\nMcKenney has therefore demonstrated a track of work that uniquely positions her to lead the Provenance Blockchain Foundation, a rapidly growing blockchain that is increasingly relied upon by financial institutions.\nMcKenney talked about her appointment and said: “The Provenance Blockchain has successfully demonstrated the ability to deliver material business benefits to participating financial institutions and their customers at scale. I am excited to advance the work underway and to deepen the innovation ecosystem of financial institutions, fintechs, developers, and other industry leaders building on and leveraging Provenance Blockchain to make financial services significantly more efficient, with more real-time capabilities and reduced counterparty risk.”\nTransforming the Financial Services Industry\nBlockchain technology is considered most attractive to financial businesses because it solves several problems plaguing the industry today, namely efficiency and security.\nLaunched in 2018, The Provenance Blockchain Foundation continues bringing greater transparency and liquidity to digital transactions worldwide. The blockchain firm helps to revolutionize how financial institutions access, trade, and issue assets globally.\nIn May last year, The Provenance Blockchain Foundation launched a public, open-source, permissionless, decentralized, proof-of-stake blockchain that provides financial service companies with a ledger, registry, and exchange across multiple financial assets and markets.\nThe open-source blockchain reduces the need for third-party intermediation. Therefore it is significantly lowering costs and freeing up capital in financial transactions. Furthermore, the Provenance blockchain promotes greater transparency and liquidity and allows for new financial engineering and business opportunities. This decentralized ecosystem also enables a robust validator/staking framework and real-time settlement and market-driven pricing.\nMany financial firms such as asset managers and banks are onboarding the Provenance blockchain in verticals like loan origination, banking and payments, financing and trading, and securities exchanges.\nThe Provenance Blockchain Foundation also provides grants to developers to accelerate growth in the DeFi ecosystem.",

    "summary": "Animoca Brands, a leading digital entertainment and blockchain technology company, reported strong financial performance in 2022, with bookings reaching A$594 million and a strong liquidity position, despite expanding its business portfolio.",
    "content": "Animoca Brands, a leading figure in the realms of digital entertainment and blockchain technology, has unveiled its financial performance for the year ending 31 December 2022, providing a comprehensive insight into its achievements and future prospects.\nThe company's financial health appears robust, with bookings escalating to a commendable A$594 million (approximately US$402 million). This figure represents a significant uptick from the A$428 million (around US$291 million) reported in the previous year. Such bookings are not just mere numbers; they encapsulate the company's diverse ventures, including token sales, NFT (Non-Fungible Token) sales, and other activities that don't necessarily fall under the blockchain umbrella.\nDiving deeper into their financial reservoir, Animoca Brands has showcased a strong liquidity position. Their cash and stablecoin reserves are pegged at A$286 million (approximately US$191 million). Furthermore, the company's liquid digital assets, which comprise reserves of the SAND utility token used predominantly in The Sandbox platform, are valued at a substantial A$690 million (roughly US$469 million). Such figures not only highlight the company's financial prowess but also underscore its strategic investments in digital assets, which are becoming increasingly pivotal in today's digital age.\nAnother noteworthy mention is the off-balance sheet token reserves associated with Animoca Brands' majority-owned Web3 subsidiaries. These reserves have reached a staggering A$2.4 billion (about US$1.6 billion). This includes an array of tokens such as PROS, ASTRAFER, QUIDD, PRIMATE, REVV, TOWER, GMEE, and several others, reflecting the company's diversified approach in the rapidly evolving blockchain space.\nIn terms of business expansion, 2022 was a landmark year for Animoca Brands. The company strategically acquired six firms, broadening its portfolio and fortifying its position in the market. These acquisitions include industry players like Grease Monkey Games, known for its prowess in game development, and PIXELYNX, a unique music metaverse gaming platform. Such acquisitions are a testament to Animoca's vision of integrating diverse digital platforms to offer unparalleled user experiences.\nThe introduction of Web3 services by Animoca Brands in 2022 is a significant stride towards bridging the gap between traditional web platforms (Web2) and blockchain-based platforms (Web3). With this venture, the company aims to guide other businesses in seamlessly integrating tokens and NFTs into their existing models. This initiative alone contributed a whopping US$120 million to the total bookings for the year, underscoring its success and potential for future growth.\nOn the leadership front, the company has infused fresh talent into its senior management. The induction of industry stalwarts like Alan Lau, Minh Do, and Jared Shaw is expected to steer the company towards newer horizons.\nProduct development has also been in the limelight, with Blowfish Studios' \"Phantom Galaxies\" making waves by securing US$19.3 million from its Planet Private Sale.\nIn conclusion, Animoca Brands, with its recognition from industry giants like Deloitte and the Financial Times, continues to shape the digital landscape. Its vast portfolio, strategic acquisitions, and focus on innovation position it as a formidable player in the digital property rights domain and the burgeoning open metaverse.",

    "content": "Chinese officials are to consider a cross-border Asian stablecoin in Hong Kong, to facilitate a cross-border payment network between three Asian countries, and four currencies - China, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. The world’s second-largest economy is aiming to build Hong Kong into an international financial center in the digital economy era.\nAt China’s annual “Two Sessions,” also known as the National People’s Congress, China’s most important annual political event in Beijing, officials set the decision to impose a new national security law in Hong Kong.\nThe annual political event was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the representatives of the National People’s Congress continue to advise on post-pandemic economic recovery.\nNeil Shen, also known as Shen Nanpeng, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China will submit five proposals to the two sessions this year. One of the proposals includes the innovation and technology development of the Greater Bay Area, which he has submitted consecutively in the past three years.\nIn Shen’s proposals, he suggested a Hong Kong-based cross border stablecoin, as a foundation for a cross-border settlement network between China, Japan, and South Korea as well as the special administrative region. Shen envisions that this move would make Hong Kong as the international digital financial hub and will empower the semi-autonomous city to achieve “stable economic and social development.”\nThe proposal was also co-signed by Kennedy Wong, solicitor of the Supreme Court in Hong Kong, former chief secretary of Hong Kong, Henry Tang, and Hong Kong-based billionaire Songqiao Zhang. The proposal is separate from China's central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, also known as the digital currency electronic payment (DCEP).\nOne stablecoin to blur the lines\nIn regards to the new national security law in Hong Kong, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said: “We will comprehensively and accurately implement ‘one country, two systems,’ under which people of Hong Kong govern Hong Kong, and the people of Macau govern Macau, with a high degree of autonomy. We will establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two SARs, and see that the governments of the two regions fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.”\nChina reported a drop in its annual growth target this year and has pledged more government spending as the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the country’s economy. Premier Li’s work report omitted a target for the gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time since 1990.\nWith Beijing announcing its plans for security legislation for Hong Kong, the United States drew warnings as the Asian stock markets fell further. Amid escalation of tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index took a dive of about 5 percent, while the yuan also dipped as the National People’s Congress highlighted uncertainties and pledged to sell bonds.\nHong Kong’s 2020 budget\nFinancial Secretary of Hong Kong, Paul Chan has been under intense pressure from lawmakers to dip into the government’s fiscal reserves to help the city get out of an economic slump. After months of anti-government protests and the emergence of the coronavirus epidemic, Hong Kong residents aged over 18 will receive a cash handout of HK$10,000. The budget also highlighted the forecast of an all-time high deficit of HK$139 billion for the coming fiscal year.\nIn the budget for 2020-2021 announced by Chan, innovation and technology has been mentioned as an important growth engine for future economic development. The Hong Kong government has allocated over a hundred billion dollars to support the innovation and technology sector.\n“Local I&T (Innovation and Technology) companies have won awards time and again in international competitions, whereas a number of “unicorns” have emerged,” Chan wrote. “While there is still some way to go to develop I&T into mature industries, I am convinced that our current investments will bear fruits in the future.”",

Additionally, perpetual futures contracts will be availed in both Ether and Bitcoin.\nOKEx is being touted to prompt more liquidity based on its notable capacity of providing world-class futures.\nHead of OKEx India, Zaz Zou, noted, “India is primed to be the driving force behind the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is why we are keen on adding more equitable currencies to the ecosystem.”\nHe added, “We believe having a variety of options to transact digital currencies will bolster the growth of the economy in India as it positively impacts both crowdfunding and institutional funding.”\nDuring DCXfutures launch, maker fees will be at 0.2%, whereas the service will be at the beginning availed to select participants on an invitation-only criterion. Nevertheless, the general public is expected to utilize DCXfutures from the second quarter of 2020 using a single wallet.\nSumt Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX, noted that India holds considerable capabilities in the crypto sector. Once fully exploited, this nation could become a force to reckon with globally.\nHe acknowledged, “With the huge potential of cryptocurrency markets to accelerate economic growth and wealth generation in India, we believe that this collaboration takes India one step closer to joining the ‘5 trillion dollar club’ as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, allowing us to avail of new opportunities and take on new challenges.”\nIndia has been making essential steps in the blockchain arena. For instance, according to LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report, sought after positions such as blockchain developers, have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels in this country.",

    "content": "Analysts state that serval factors will potentially determine whether Bitcoin follows its 60% gain in 2021 with another banner year, one question that arises among others is to what extent will Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve tighten policy to stem inflation?\nAfter a hawkish turn, the Federal Reserve took some steam out of cryptocurrencies at the year-end of 2021. Central bank policy is taking a key role in the debate about the outlook for tokens in 2022.\nExperts also state that as companies from Meta Platforms Inc (formerly Facebook) to Apple Inc go deeper into the metaverse and consumers keep flocking towards non-fungible tokens (NFT), that craze will push crypto higher regardless of the obstacles created by macroeconomic forces at play.\nThe sale last year of an NFT artwork for $69.3 million at Christie’s or the loosely organized group of crypto investors that battled billionaire Ken Griffin at an auction for a copy of the US Constitution are among several other examples of the booming crypto industry.\n“We are bullish Bitcoin long-term, based on our long-term trend-following gauges,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies LLC, told Bloomberg.\nMeanwhile, sceptics are seeing a rather challenging year for the crypto space.\n“Although I expect the speculative zeal to continue in the crypto space, it, like bloated technology valuations, faces a much more challenging environment in 2022,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific told Bloomberg. “The primary reason is the start of interest-rate normalization by the Federal Reserve but with other major central banks likely to follow as well. That will challenge the raison d’être that crypto is an alternative to fiat money.”\n“Hanging over the crypto space is the threat of more regulation, and frankly, with a new coin coming out every week which is ‘the next big thing’ and driven by speculation and not blockchain, I’m struggling to see how any of them will be,” Halley said. “I continue to believe that cryptocurrencies are the greatest case of financial-market group-think stupidity in history. The music may keep playing for part of 2022, but the emperor still isn’t wearing any clothes.”\nAccording to a report by Blockchain.News, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele predicted his bullish forecasts for bitcoin in 2022, saying that the bitcoin price will reach a high of $100K this year.\nIn addition, Bukele also stated that Bitcoin would “become a major electoral issue in US elections this year”, asking his 3.2 million Twitter followers to pay attention to the “big surprise” at the Bitcoin 2022 conference. He also has confidence in Bitcoin adoption, estimating two more countries might adopt it as legal tender.",

Currently, those services are still under suspension.\nCrypto Briefing reported that Celsius has made a number of other repayments over the past week. Celsius has paid $53.6 million DAI in a series of transactions to its vault with Oasis Protocol, a yield-bearing DeFi platform.\nAccording to Gemini, DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin issued by Ethereum-based protocol MakerDAO, which seeks to maintain an exact ratio of one-to-one with the US dollar.\nCelsius, an Etherscan block explorer, uses DeFi protocols to generate interest for its clients.\nAlthough the $10 million payment is only a small fraction of Celsius’ activity, this step is likely a move towards solvency. The payment is also a potential move to close positions with clients to regain liquidity and re-open withdrawals.\nCelsius’ repayment comes shortly after the company confirmed through a blog that the suspension of withdrawals, transactions and swaps will continue.\n“Our objective continues to be stabilising our liquidity and operations,” the firm wrote on June 19. It added that this “will take time” and that it will “continue to work around the clock.”\nCelsius has also stated that it will cooperate with regulators and officials in investigating the company’s suspension of services.\nCelsius further confirmed that it would pause Twitter activities and AMAs to prioritise resolving the current situation.",

    "content": "Popular crypto exchange FTX has witnessed a massive dip in the price of their native token after an increase in withdrawals kickstarted by another top crypto exchange Binance, who planned to sell off all their FTX tokens.\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the price of the FTX native token, FTT, has tumbled by 15% to $18 in Singapore.\nPrior to the tumble, FTX CEO Bankman-Fried's trading house Alameda Research had offered to buy all of Binance's FTT tokens at $22.\nThe offer had come after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) on Sunday had offered to sell the crypto firm's roughly $530 million holding of FTT.\nCZ and Bankman-Fried have been caught in an ongoing discussion on Twitter for the past few months, over issues ranging from lobbying US politicians to allegations of frontrunning trades.\nCZ has denied claims that selling FTT tokens was a \"move against a competitor,\" but his later tweets have implied that he has been unhappy with FTX.\nThe dip has also affected other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, which fell to their lowest in two weeks on Tuesday.\nBitcoin, the top digital currency fell as much as 6.4% to $19,370, while its next-biggest rival Ether lost up to 9% to $1,434, both at levels unseen since October 25.\nMeanwhile, Solana plunged nearly 20%.\nAnother major crypto firm or decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has been affected by the dip.\nBitDAO, one of the largest DAOs, has witnessed its native token BIT slip 20%. Following the dip, the community behind BitDDAO has asked Alameda to prove that they continue to hold 100 million BIT tokens that they acquired in November last year by converting 3.36 million FTT tokens.\nThe token swap deal requires Alameda to hold tokens for at least three years.\nBybit's co-founder Ben Zhao tweeted, \"BitDAO community is questioning the sudden dump of $bit token caused by Alameda dumping and breaching the 3-year mutual no sale public commitment. Nothing is confirmed but BitDAO community would like to confirm proof of funds from Alameda.\"\nFurther, the BitDAO community has issued a subtle threat to take action. BitDAO is perhaps planning to sell the acquired 3,362,315 FTX tokens, in case Alameda does not offer clarification in 24 hours.\nHowever, Bankman-Fried stated that the exchange is doing \"fine\". He also added that the concerns about the crypto exchange turning into deeper issues were just \"false rumours.\"",

The holdings also mean that an array of shareholders are also indirectly exposed to cryptocurrency as Bitcoin makes the company’s balance sheet.\nInterestingly, the government of Norway holds a 2% stake in Microstrategy, meaning that all Norwegians are now also exposed to Bitcoin indirectly.\nInvestments by the publicly traded companies on this list are proving to be a catalyst for the demand of Bitcoin on an enterprise level, and we can expect to see this list keep growing.",

Zhao also pointed out that investment banking is a reasonable strategy for Binance because when partnering with banks, Binance usually attracts many new users, which will also boost the bank's valuation.\n\"What we have found is when banks work with us, we drive so many users to them, so the bank's valuation goes up, like why don't we just invest in them as well, so that we capture some of the equity upside, \"he said.\nCZ said in an interview at the Web Summit in Lisbon: \"There are people who hold certain types of local licenses, traditional banking, payment-service providers, even banks. We're looking at those things.\"\nZhao has said in the past that Binance has more than $1 billion to spend on acquisitions, with its acquisition strategy focused on areas such as DeFi and NFTs.\nHe stressed that traditional financial institutions are now more closely linked to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. He said that despite the cold winter in the cryptocurrency market due to a number of factors, such as interest rate hikes, the correlation between digital assets and traditional finance -\"TradFi\" is still deepening. Well-known traditional financial services companies include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc, etc.\nIn June, U.S. multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc showed interest in acquiring troubled cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network, hoping to buy the company at a steep discount, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nIn September, BlackRock, a New York-based US multinational investment company, has expanded its crypto service offerings by launching a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) that provides exposure to blockchain and crypto companies for its European customers.\nBinance recently confirmed that the crypto exchange has invested in Musk's Twitter deal.

Since its inception in 2021, BlockSec has played a key role in warding off attacks on several protocols, including the stablecoin DEX Saddle Finance.\nThus far, BlockSec has audited as many as 100 protocols spanning the Solidity and Rust ecosystems respectively. BlockSec has developed a real-time on-chain monitoring system to block ongoing attacks and rescued more than 5 million assets. The flash loan monitoring system and the transaction visualization system are both Intellectual Properties of BlockSec, which are widely used in the industry today.\nThe ongoing exploitation of crypto-native protocols has stirred the demand for more security-focused outfits. Expectedly, investors realize this and notably contribute their quota to helping startups in the space. As reported earlier by Blockchain.News, CertiK recently pulled $88 million in funding to ink a $2 billion valuation.\nThe CertiK funding was notably unique as American investment banking giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc joined the investors who bootstrapped the blockchain security firm.

    "summary": "ZetaChain and Curve Finance have partnered to introduce native Bitcoin support for cross-chain swaps and omnichain asset pools, enhancing asset management efficiency across blockchains.",
    "content": "ZetaChain, a universal blockchain platform, has announced a strategic partnership with Curve Finance. This collaboration introduces native Bitcoin (BTC) support for cross-chain swaps and omnichain asset pools, marking a pivotal moment in blockchain interoperability and asset management.\nZetaChain's Universal Blockchain Capabilities\nZetaChain, recognized for its universal blockchain capabilities, is making a substantial leap in blockchain interoperability. It's an EVM-compatible Layer 1 (L1) project designed to manage assets on any blockchain from one place. This approach enables seamless asset management and interactions across various blockchain networks, significantly enhancing the efficiency and functionality of the DeFi ecosystem.\nIntegration with Curve Finance: A New Era of DeFi\nCurve Finance, a leading DeFi platform, is integrating ZetaChain to provide the first native BTC support for cross-chain swaps and omnichain asset pools. This integration signifies a remarkable evolution in DeFi, as it enables the management of diverse assets such as Ethereum (ETH) on Ethereum, BTC on Bitcoin, and USDC on Polygon within a single, unified liquidity pool. Users can now deposit native tokens from any wallet on any chain, including Bitcoin from Bitcoin wallet addresses, into these pools.\nThe essence of this collaboration lies in enabling efficient, native cross-chain swaps for Curve users. For instance, users can input native BTC from their Bitcoin wallet and exchange it for native ETH on Ethereum, or vice versa. This capability dramatically enhances trading flexibility and accessibility, making Curve a hub where the boundaries between different blockchain networks blur.\nAdvantages and Future Prospects\nThis integration is expected to be highly cost-effective, potentially requiring significantly less gas than traditional messaging-based bridge solutions. The efficiency stems from ZetaChain’s single contract architecture and its EVM compatibility, which allows for the deployment of an omnichain Curve on ZetaChain without any modifications.\nLooking ahead, this partnership is poised to increase trading volume on Curve, introduce new collateral options like native Bitcoin for backing crvUSD, and simplify navigation across the crypto landscape. The next step involves launching Curve on ZetaChain's mainnet, bolstered by incentives and growth mechanisms to ensure the long-term success of the partnership.\nConclusion\nThe collaboration between Curve Finance and ZetaChain is a strategic move that not only enhances Curve Finance’s capabilities but also demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of DeFi innovation. By bridging the gap between various blockchain networks, this partnership lays a solid foundation for the future of decentralized finance, offering users a cohesive and integrated experience.",

    "summary": "The top 10 decentralized applications on the Ethereum network have hit 1,017,760 daily active wallet users, according to data analytics company DappRadar.",
    "content": "In the last one month, the top 10 decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum network have hit 1,017,760 daily active wallet users, according to data acquisition and analytics company DappRadar.\nMost Ethereum users are on DeFi platforms\nPer the report, 94% or 952,920 of the daily active wallets fall under the decentralized finance (DeFi) and exchange dapps category. This can be attributed to the fact that 6 of the top 10 are in this sector, while two belong to the high-risk category, which are dapps that don't last for more than a few months. The remaining two are from the marketplace and gaming categories.\nCompared to the mobile app market, the one million users is relatively small, but it shows a notable turning point that DeFi has made the Ethereum network a force to be reckoned with.\nThis report correlates with the fact that Ethereum has been making headways in recent months because its blockchain is being heavily leveraged in the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, as well as for other projects like dapps and smart contracts.\nFor instance, $100 million worth of Tether (USDT), a leading stablecoin, was recently transferred from the Tron network, a blockchain-based decentralized operating system, to the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe report noted:\nCollectibles and gaming take a share\nNot only is the Ethereum blockchain being embraced in the DeFi market, but it also plays a huge part in the digital collectible and gaming sectors. This can be alluded to because Axie Infinity, a blockchain gaming dapp, and Rarible, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, made it to the top ten.\nThese statistics show that technological innovation is continuously taking place in this space. For instance, sports teams are leveraging the Ethereum network to enable fans to build their preferred teams and trade digital collectibles.\nEarlier this month, German football giant, FC Bayern Munich, joined an Ethereum-based fantasy soccer game platform called Sorare, which leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The reigning UEFA Champions League winners became the third German club playing under the Bundesliga league to join Sorare, which has at least 100 licensed teams.\nIn other news, Ethereum stored on crypto exchanges recently sank to a two-year low, and this was interpreted to mean that the confidence of holders was growing based on the long term value of this cryptocurrency.",

    "summary": "New Money Theory Research: Blockchain to Usher in the New Age of Monetary and Financial Freedom",
    "content": "New Money Theory Research: Blockchain to Usher in the New Age of Monetary and Financial Freedom\nThroughout history, humans have progressed through both a reliance on institutions and in many cases by rebelling against institutions that no longer serve them. In order to improve the overall social efficiency of our civilization, processes of social division of labor emerged where individuals would transfer their rights to an institution like the government or a bank which acts as credit agency. Governments and banks are indeed the most typical credit agencies in existence. It may not be that obvious, but credit agencies are actually everywhere and act as intermediaries for most basic transactions in human life. There are few deals that people can make without a third party involved.\nWhen people initiate a property purchase transaction, they do not simply exchange money with the current owner for the deed of that property. They are obligated through traditional systems to put trust into third parties or intermediaries such as mortgage lenders, real estate agents, brokers/realtors, home inspectors, home appraisers, insurance agents etc. In our current economic ecosystem, the owner and buyer will find it almost impossible to make a property deal without the involvement of a third party.\nHere is another example. Let’s say you have 10 million U.S. dollars. Unless you have the amount in physical cash, you do not actually hold the money; instead, what you do have is access to a bank account that records your ownership of the sum. Without a second thought, you put all your trust into the bank that creates and maintains that record of your finances. The reality is that the reliability, security and accounting of banking institutions is a system that people simply take for granted in this modern era—but is it the best way? Well, let’s go deeper, what may surprise some is that the actual value of our money itself is also completely reliant on the trust people have for their Central Bank—the embodiment of their nation’s credit. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, a monetary standard that created money backed by gold reserves—our fiat currencies are now issued based on national credit and by the central banks. Central banking practices, however, have a demonstrable history of devaluing our currencies. It only takes a conscientious look back at the history of currency issuance through national credit to deduce that this contemporary system is extremely unreliable. While most people today still appear to view the U.S. as the most financially reliable country in the world, the reality is that we have seen the U.S. national credit default on several occasions. The collapse of Bretton Woods system was, in fact, the result of a U.S. national default. As Bitcoin founder Satoshi once said: “The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”\nIf we could reduce our reliance on credit agencies to a bare minimum, we can cut out significant transaction costs and more importantly—lower the risks of institutional power being abused or expanded. Credit agencies by their nature abuse and expand their power, usually under the guise of serving the people, which in extreme cases could lead to dictatorship and monopoly. Wherever there is a dependence, there is the possibility of being enslaved. Human history is largely a history of fighting against imposed “serfdom”.\nOne of the greatest achievements in the history of humanity, was the introduction of constitutions for the purpose of restricting government’s power and protecting private ownership—basic laws that apply to all people and served to abolish class systems. However, there is still one more hidden, untamed and indirect powers exist that are driving us to economic serfdom—the U.S. dollar and the Federal Reserve that creates its monetary policies.\nOil Exclusively Adopting U.S. Dollar Replaces Gold standard\nThe Vietnam war proved costly for the U.S., requiring the nation to spend vast resources to fund its military operations. During this period, the excessive printing of U.S. dollars to pay for the expense pushed up the dollar’s commodity price but could not affect the stable price level of its pegged gold benchmark. The continuous inflation of U.S. dollars resulted in an accelerated pileup of at least USD 80 billion Eurodollars which European wanted to redeem their USD for gold in late 1960s.\nThe collapse of Bretton Woods was a result of gradual loss of confidence in U.S. dollar. In May 1971, West Germany left the Bretton Wood system and Switzerland redeemed USD 50 million for gold. In early August 1971, France sent a warship to New York Harbor and redeemed USD 191 million from the New York Federal Reserve Bank. On August 11, the British ambassador requested to redeem USD 3 billion for gold[1]. These gold withdrawals have placed mounting pressure on U.S.’s long term gold reserves. In an attempt to protect the remaining U.S. gold reserves, President Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard. By dissolving the Bretton Woods agreement, Nixon and his globalist accomplice, Henry Kissinger, knew global demand for the dollar would decline. Since then, the U.S. gold reserve kept unchanged.\nAfter the Yom Kippur war, the Saudis and Americans struck a deal—the U.S. would protect the Saudi oilfields and restrain any threats from Israel and in return the Saudis agreed to price all of their oil sales in U.S. dollars only and to refuse all other currencies. This led to the rise of Petrodollar [2].\nBy 1975, every single oil-producing nation of the OPEC had agreed to price their oil in dollars and to hold their surplus oil proceeds in U.S. government debt securities in exchange for the generous offers made by the U.S. The world’s subsequent reliance on oil further galvanized the U.S. dollar as the de facto world currency to facilitate trade and commerce meanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to monopolize U.S. monetary policies without restriction.\nAs Lord Acton famously expressed to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887—absolute power corrupts absolutely—and the U.S. dollar has unfortunately not been the exception to this rule. Unlike the gold standard, currency created without consensus and without support, will fall prey to the law of the jungle which holds that the habitat is destined to be ruled by the apex species. While the U.S. dollar is clearly no longer at the apex, the currency has been manipulated through monetary policies in order to maintain its current dominant international status. These policies have unfortunately been created to serve the sole interests of the currency issuer, even when it undermines the economic wellbeing of other countries or regions and their people—indirectly leading the world into the soft dictatorship of the U.S. dollar.\nIf the U.S. dollar represents our monetary enslavement then blockchain-based cryptocurrency paves the way to monetary freedom in some sense.\nThe Essential Advantage of Blockchain\nBlockchains incorporate several important features such as immutability, encryption and distributed storage, which combined makes secure peer-to-peer transactions possible and in turn has created the means to end human dependence on credit and thus credit intermediaries. Due to these features, blockchain has been referred to as ‘the Trust Machine’ and is forecasted to transfer the trust from agencies and institutions which are enforced by law to machine-based networks guaranteed by technology and mathematics.\nLet’s take a look at the profound potential impact blockchain has on our monetary and financial system. We previously introduced three key aspects of money: money forms, money issuance standards, and the flow of money.[3] With blockchain, we are leveraging a brand-new system of architecture for the flow of money. In addition, blockchain makes new forms of money available that could bring us to realize the notion of “absolutely private property” for the first time in human history—where ownership of an asset on a blockchain is guaranteed by technology and mathematics. Bitcoin, for example, the original cryptocurrency, of which the ownership depends on a private encrypted key. Without the correct private key, there is no way to move bitcoins around, even if it is ordered by law on pain of enforcement. As for the money issuance standard, blockchain has even more to offer.\nBlockchain-based Money Issuance Standard for a Better Society\nBitcoin opens the door to new concepts of money issuance. The issuance of bitcoin is by Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm first proposed in 1993. By the algorithm, the problem of issuance of bitcoin is reduced to the task of mining.\nBitcoin mining is “the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together.” [4] The computation power of the bitcoin network is generally measured by the hash rate. Bitcoin mining has raised concerns around power and computing power waste. However, computing power may be the most important basic parameter and issue of our future society. It would motivate the improvement of computing power and research of high-efficiency power usage. The more important question here is how to reduce the consumption of power and convert computing power to computer contributions in some sense.\nWe propose our principle for the money issuance standard: extract the most important parameter(s) from the driving forces behind human society and future technological developments; then use these factor(s) as inputs of the money issuance rule. In this way, the problem of money issuance is reduced to contributions to factor(s) that make the world better.\nThe Profound Impact of the New Money Issuance Standard\nThe era of “machine-orientation” is the beginning of measuring the value of people and machines with a unified scale, and it is also the beginning of the blurring of the boundaries between people and machines in terms of social contribution. Different from the traditional human labor based social value system, the new standard will lead us to rethink and reconstruct our entire social value system. The emergence of bitcoin and blockchain thus marked the beginning of the transition from a carbon-based civilization to a silicon-based civilization. Although we can map real world assets to blockchain, we still need a currency to measure the value of the blockchain system itself.\nCurrency—the Key Factor in Future Blockchain-based Value Networks\nFor future value networks that are blockchain based, we need to answer some basic questions regarding value: What is value? How is value created and where makes something valuable? Currency is the most direct means of value quantification and is the most basic form for the evaluation value of a blockchain network. The money issuance standard on blockchain will determine how to create money, in turn it will determine its value, which consequently will re-define all social values.\nAbout the Authors:\nKun Hu\nCEO of Worldmoney.org\nProfessor Francis Lau\nAssociate dean of Faculty of Engineering, HKU; Former Department Head of Computer Sciences; Former vice president of the IEEE Computer Society.\nContributors\nMatthew Lam\nContent Manager of Blockchain.News\nLucas Cacioli\nJournalist of Blockchain.News",

    "title": "Over 81% Helium Community Approves Migration to Solana Blockchain",
    "summary": "Helium developers proposed the migration to help scale the blockchain through more efficient transactions and interoperability.",
    "content": "The Helium Foundation on Thursday announced the migration of its decentralized wireless Internet of Things (IoT) network, the Helium Network, to the Solana blockchain. The foundation approved the decision after a successful community vote on the proposal.\nSince its establishment in 2013, the Helium network has been operating on its own blockchain, known as HIP 70.\nOn Thursday, the foundation disclosed that a majority community vote of 81.41% approved the Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP 70) aimed at developing the network to meet user demand. The proposal requirements demanded participants to stake the Helium native token (HNT) in order to engage in the voting exercise.\nAccording to the final results, 6,177 members voted in favour of the migration by staking some 12 million HNT ($57 million) versus 1,270 members who voted against the proposal.\nThe Helium Foundation stated that the transition will allow HNT to become more compatible with other projects and crypto applications in non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other Web3 applications.\nHelium Foundation COO Scott Sigel said: “Solana has a proven track record powering some of the world’s most important decentralized initiatives, and they were an obvious choice for us to partner with. Moving to the Solana blockchain allows us to focus our efforts on scaling the network as opposed to managing the blockchain itself.”\nChallenges to be Fixed\nThe proposal comes after the Helium core developer team recently called for the need to fix various technical issues to improve the network’s capabilities. Last month, the developers acknowledged that there have been challenges facing network participants with much reduced Proof-of-Coverage activity because of network size, blockchain/validator load, and packet delivery issues.\nTheir announcement came after node hotspot operators in the Helium subreddit in July posted about the dwindling rewards made from their efforts, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of investment into Helium.\nSuch criticisms of the Helium blockchain project stirred a strong debate over the company's long-term prospects.\nAs a result, the Helium developers made the proposal, dubbed HIP 70, on August 31. They forwarded the HIP 70 proposal to improve data transfer and network coverage abilities. They said the move is aimed to “bring significant economies of scale through the vast range of composable Solana developer tools, features, and applications.”\nThey said the move aims to scale Helium to meet the demands of builders and users as part of efforts to accelerate the decentralized wireless network of Helium 5G and over 945,000 Internet of Things (IoT) user-managed hotspot devices across the world.\nAccording to the Helium Foundation, the migration will see Helium’s ecosystem tokens, including HNT, IOT and MOBILE tokens and Data Credits (DCs), soon be issued on Solana. Once the migration is completed, Helium will roll out a new version of the Helium Wallet App to be available for users, the foundation said.\nThe news comes after Nova Labs, the company behind the Helium network, on Tuesday formed a five-year deal with T-Mobile’s 5G services to embark on filling the gaps in Helium’s coverage. Blockchain.News reported the matter.\nHelium is an open-source blockchain network designed to power Internet of Things (IoT) devices with wireless connectivity. Founded in 2013, the decentralized wireless network has grown to become a huge continuous wireless network across the globe. Helium has a presence in 65,000 cities and 170 countries, focusing on serving the Internet of Things (IoT) around the world.",

She highlighted that stablecoins could pose serious dangers, which could threaten monetary sovereignty and financial stability.\nCryptoassets are highly speculative and volatile\nLagarde threw criticism at crypto-assets for not being in a position to maintain a stable value because they are highly speculative, illiquid, and volatile. As a result, they do not adhere to the full functions of money.\nThe ECB president said in a statement on Nov 30, that stablecoins have the potential of driving additional innovation in payments and be integrated into trade, social media, and other platforms. Lagarde cautioned:\nBy using stablecoins as a store of value, Lagarde believes this could trigger a paradigm shift of bank deposits to these digital assets. This could distort the transmission of monetary policy and banks' operations.\nThe rollout of a Digital Euro\nLagarde also delved into the issue of the digital euro, viewing it as a game-changer in the modern era. She noted:\nThe ECB president acknowledged that the issuance of a digital euro could be pivotal in ensuring the continued access to monetary sovereignty and central bank money.\nHer praises for the digital euro comes at a time when the German Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, recently called for speedy interventions in the rollout of this digital currency because it can be an ideal instrument to fill the void triggered by a high demand for digital money from businesses and consumers in Europe.",

    "content": "Mark Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur famous for his role as an investor on Shark Tank where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch their business models, has watered down his Bitcoin criticism and now appears to view it as a store of value.\nDuring a conversation with Preston Pysh, a bitcoin believer and co-founder of the Investor’s Podcast Network, Cuban tweeted that Bitcoin can be a store of value. Still, it has not yet proven that it can replace the present financial system.\nThis response by Cuban marks a remarkable change in the billionaire's attitude towards Bitcoin, when compared to a response he made late last year after being asked why he was not a crypto supporter.\nHe stipulated, “I’d rather have bananas. I can eat bananas. Crypto, not so much. Look, I can make a great argument for blockchain. There’s a lot of applications, and they’ll be used. But you don’t need public Bitcoin, BTC. You can create blockchain on your own without using all the available cryptocurrencies.”\nCuban’s view about Bitcoin being a store of value comes at a time when a recent survey revealed that 60% of Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past year. The on-chain analysis company noted that this trend illustrated investor’s hodling behavior as the leading cryptocurrency is regarded as a store of value.\nCuban’s sentiments show the way Bitcoin is no longer an asset that is in oblivion in the eyes of many investors.\nMoreover, analysis from leading companies like Bloomberg suggests that Bitcoin price could surge past $20,000 this year, by doubling an all-time high of $14,000 recorded last year. It further indicated that adoption was the key metric as the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event took place on May 11, and mining rewards were slashed from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.",

    "content": "According to crypto sleuth ZachXBT, Lark Davis withdrew $2.5 million from Celsius long before the company crashed.\nCrypto influencer Lark Davis appears to have absconded the Celsius network bankruptcy scandal with $2.5 million after being one of the company’s promoters.\nDavis has previously promoted Celsius, supporting the company and praising it to his over 400,000 subscribers on YouTube. As reported, Davis withdrew millions before June, over a month before the Celsius crash.\nSome critics say Davis must have withdrawn the funds after hearing insider information about the company’s incoming crash.\nOn Thursday, Celsius released a bulky financial report containing the names of all Celsius users and their transactions.\nIn the report, not only Davis withdrew a considerable sum before the company's demise, but Co-founders – Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon had also withdrawn $12 million and $11 million respectively. ZachXBT's claim against Davis is most likely based on this report.\nWhile ZachXBT posted about his allegation on Twitter, some tweeps booed him while some supported him. A user commented, saying: “I follow your work and I think it’s phenomenal… but in this case, I also took my money before the crash and I’m a normal person… rumors were circulating…”\nAnother user also commented, saying, “I’m pretty sure I remember him posting that he was removing all his funds from Celsius when rumors of problems started circulating.”\nEarlier this week, Celsius Network Ltd lost another top member as co-founder Daniel Leon resigned. CNBC reported, citing an internal email, that Lior Koren, previously the company’s global tax director, is taking over and operating out of Israel.\nIn addition, the company disclosed earlier this week the auction dates for its assets. Based on a filing with the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, the deadline for the final bid has been slated for October 17, but if need be, it will be pushed to October 20.",

    "content": "Block's, formerly Square, second-quarter earnings report has exceeded expectations.\nPayment firm Block generated $4.4 billion in total revenue in the second quarter of 2022, beating FactSet's average analyst estimate of $4.3 billion. The company's mobile payment app, Cash App, made $1.79 billion in bitcoin revenue.\nBitcoin-related revenue declined 6.6% year-on-year from last year's second quarter due to the cryptocurrency market's cold winter.\nEarnings per share came in at 18 cents, beating analysts' average estimate of 16 cents.\nCash App is a mobile payment service developed by Square, which allows users to transfer money using a mobile app.\nHowever, Cash App's bitcoin revenue and gross profit both declined compared to the previous quarter. Square Cash App generated $1.79 billion in bitcoin revenue and $41 million in bitcoin gross profit in Q2 2022, down 34% and 24%, respectively, year over year.\nThe released report said this was due to “a decline in consumer demand and the price of bitcoin, related in part to broader uncertainty around crypto assets, which more than offset the benefit of volatility in the price of bitcoin during the quarter.”\nAlthough Bitcoin has recently suffered from the cryptocurrency winter, many companies holding it have sold it, such as tesla, but Square has opted to kept it.\nAs a result, there was a corresponding $36 million impairment on the intangible asset bitcoin investment. However, Square revealed that based on observations of market prices, the fair value of our investment in Bitcoin is as high as $160 million, which is still more than the $127 million above the book value of the investment as of June 30.\nThis January, Block Inc, formerly known as Square, will begin mining Bitcoin with its mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide.",

    "summary": "Sygnum Bank breaks new ground by tokenizing USD 50M of Matter Labs' treasury reserves into the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund, enhancing the synergy between traditional finance and crypto.",
    "content": "Sygnum, a prominent digital asset banking group, has announced the tokenization of USD 50 million of Matter Labs' treasury reserves. This strategic initiative has been facilitated through an investment in Fidelity International's USD 6.9 billion Institutional Liquidity Fund (ILF), marking a significant advance in the integration of blockchain technology with conventional financial products.\nMatter Labs, renowned for its pioneering work in scaling Ethereum through zk-rollup technology, has taken this step as part of its broader strategy to transition its treasury reserves onto the blockchain. The on-chain representation of Fidelity's ILF units via Sygnum-issued security tokens provides a secure and transparent \"Proof-of-Reserves\", aligning with Matter Labs' commitment to transparency and institutional-grade security.\nThis project is the first of its kind to utilize Sygnum's multi-chain tokenization solution, converging the capabilities of traditional securities with blockchain's distinct advantages. By tokenizing a portion of the investment in Fidelity's money market fund, Sygnum is not only reinforcing the Crypto-TradFi nexus but also laying the groundwork for a fully tokenized financial ecosystem.\nJürg Rimle, Country Head Switzerland at Fidelity International, shared his enthusiasm for the partnership with Sygnum Bank, highlighting the increased access it provides to professional and institutional investors and underscoring the strengthening bridge between digital asset economies and traditional finance.\nFatmire Bekiri, Head of Tokenisation at Sygnum, elaborated on the collaboration's potential, emphasizing the combined strengths of blockchain technology and the expertise of a Tier 1 global investment manager. The collaboration illustrates Sygnum's mission to meld the crypto space with traditional finance (Trad-Fi) sectors to forge the future of on-chain finance.\nMarco Cora, SVP of Business and Operations at Matter Labs, expressed the firm's eagerness to work with Sygnum in showcasing the institutional-grade security of the zkSync blockchain. The move to tokenize USD 50 million of their treasury reserves underlines Matter Labs' dedication to leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced investor confidence and transparency.\nThe rising trend of Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization, which saw a 74% increase in 2023 to USD 2.5 billion, speaks to the growing interest and confidence in the tokenization of traditional assets. The benefits, such as improved liquidity, accessibility, and the creation of new financial products, are catalyzing a shift towards more efficient and transparent financial markets.\nSygnum, with a banking license in Switzerland and licenses in Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and Luxembourg, is positioning itself as a leader in the digital asset banking sphere. The firm's vision of \"Future Finance\" is rooted in a legacy of Swiss and Singapore heritage, bridging the gap between the traditional and digital asset economies.\nAs the digital asset space continues to evolve, the tokenization of Matter Labs' treasury reserves via Sygnum's platform is a testament to the potential for innovative financial solutions that leverage blockchain technology. It is a step towards a future where digital and traditional financial services are no longer distinct, but rather, seamlessly integrated.",

    "summary": "The EIB says Blockchain technology and AI has a shortfall in funding to the tune of $12 billion.",
    "content": "The European Investment Bank (EIB) has highlighted broad underinvestment in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence.\nAccording to a Reuters report Tuesday, the 27-bloc region lags behind the United States of America and China per investments in both technologies.\nWhile both the US and China account for more than 80% of the 25 billion euros of annual equity investments in blockchain and AI, the E.U only accounts for about 7% or 1.75 billion euros of the total funds. Per the investment rate, the European Union notably has a shortfall of 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in both technologies.\n\"Companies and governments in Europe are substantially underinvesting in AI and blockchain compared to other leading regions, and it has become clear that the European Union struggles to translate its scientific excellence into the business application and economic success,\" the bank said in a report.\nThe EU believes the duo of both technologies can help overhaul the primary sectors, which the COVID-19 pandemic has heavily hit. These sectors include the health and financial sectors, as well as in business intelligence, respectively. Despite recognising the shortfall in the financing, the EIB said the current market condition could make this gap widen more.\n\"EU and member state support schemes could plug part of the gap, but private markets will need to contribute the balance,\" the bank said.\nThe EIB’s recommendation is coming when investors are generally enthused with American and Chinese markets. Some emerging tech firms and legacy institutions in Europe have favoured going public outside of the region, contributing to the build-up in the lack of investments in key emerging technologies. Besides these factors, the EIB highlights high upfront investment needs, lack of knowledge, and limited EU venture capital funds in both technologies.\nOn its part, the EIB is building a bond sale platform using blockchain technology.",

    "summary": "Optimism Foundation announces a private sale of 19.5 million OP tokens, initiating a two-year lockup period for governance participation, amid a positive market trajectory.",
    "content": "The Optimism Collective has recently made a strategic move by conducting a private token sale involving approximately 19.5 million OP tokens. This significant transaction comes at a time when the Optimism network, a layer-two blockchain built on top of Ethereum, is gaining increased attention for its role in scaling the Ethereum ecosystem.\nThe private sale, as disclosed on the Optimism governance forum on March 7, 2024, places the sold tokens under a two-year lockup period. However, the agreement allows the purchaser to delegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for governance purposes, ensuring that the tokens remain active in the protocol's decision-making processes even during the lockup.\nThese tokens originate from the Unallocated segment of the OP Token treasury, which is part of the Foundation's initial working budget, amounting to 30% of the initial supply of OP tokens. The Optimism Foundation has always upheld transparency as a core value, and as such, public tracking of the OP token supply is maintained and accessible to the community.\nThe announcement also gave the community a heads-up about several planned transactions that will occur over the next few days to facilitate the token sale. Although the specific terms and the identity of the purchaser remain undisclosed due to the private nature of the sale, the Optimism Foundation has reassured the community that these activities are part of their planned operations.\nThe current market conditions appear favorable for Optimism, with the price of OP tokens showing resilience and growth. According to data from CoinMarketCap, as of the last update, the OP token is valued at $4.62 USD, with a 24-hour trading volume of $419,349,624 USD. The token has seen a recent peak, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 just two days prior on March 6, 2024, and has since maintained a strong position in the market with a ranking of #28 in terms of market capitalization.\nThe private sale is a testament to the growing interest in Optimism's technology and its potential to enhance the Ethereum network's scalability. Optimism utilizes optimistic rollups to achieve scalability while benefiting from Ethereum's security. This approach allows for lower transaction fees and faster processing times, which are critical for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.\nThe sale's timing aligns with the broader crypto market's recovery, which has seen renewed investor interest in blockchain projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Optimism's focus on simplicity, pragmatism, sustainability, and, true to its name, optimism, positions it as a significant player in the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem.",

    "summary": "While many institutions struggled to recover from the market downturn experienced in March, publicly-traded, blockchain-focused firm BTCS Inc. (OTCQB: BTCS) has increased its portfolio by 285 percent in Q2 2020, through well-timed investments in both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), and crossed the $1 million mark for cryptocurrency assets under management (AUM).",
    "content": "While many institutions struggled to recover from the market downturn experienced in March, publicly-traded, blockchain-focused firm BTCS Inc. (OTCQB: BTCS) has increased its portfolio by 285 percent in Q2 2020, through well-timed investments in both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), and crossed the $1 million mark for cryptocurrency assets under management (AUM).\nFollowing the positive growth performance seen in Q2 2020, BTCS is reportedly eyeing further growth and systemic diversification of its cryptocurrency holdings. However, BTCS said its investment strategy will only focus on cryptocurrencies which it believes are not securities.\nTimely Crypto Purchasing Catapults BTCS Portfolio Valuation\nAt the end of June 2020, the BTCS crypto portfolio stood at a total value of $1.02 million with sizeable positions in BTC and ETH. Having elected not to add further investments to its portfolio, BTCS navigated the massive decline in cryptocurrency prices seen in mid-March.\nWith the World Health Organization (WHO) classifying the novel coronavirus as a pandemic on March 11, panic spread through both the crypto and broader financial space. By the following day, both markets were seeing a cascade of forced selloffs as traders sought liquid cash in preparation for the inevitable lockdowns.\nBy holding off from adding to its crypto investments during the first quarter of 2020, BTCS safeguarded its balance sheet from the decline seen on Black Thursday. Bitcoin fell to $3,867 in a matter of hours as token selloffs triggered forced liquidations across several derivatives exchanges, including BitMEX. The entire crypto market capitalization shrank by about 50 percent.\nDuring Q2 2020, BTCS added 33.7 BTC and 1,319.6 ETH to its crypto holdings. In total, the company’s cryptocurrency exposure rose to 54.3 BTC and 2,304.6 ETH.\nSince March 12, bitcoin is up almost 150 percent with its Q2 performance standing at 50 percent. In U.S. dollar (USD) terms, BTCS’s crypto holdings grew, primarily from accumulation, from less than $300,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2020 to over $1 million by the end of Q2 2020, representing a 285 percent increase.\nPortfolio Diversification And Other Future Plans\nHaving successfully navigated the pitfalls in the crypto market during the first half of 2020, BTCS is reportedly looking toward expanding its cryptocurrency portfolio. However, given the mixed fortunes of other institutions since the onset of COVID-19, BTCS says it will adopt a carefully measured approach to its portfolio diversification plans.\nBTCS is also looking to acquire controlling interests in businesses in the blockchain industry. Recent reports by Deloitte and LeadBlock point to increasing enterprise adoption of the novel technology with over a third of organizations across the world utilizing the emerging technology in their operations.",

    "content": "This article is contributed by our content partner, Nexchange NOW.\nDr. Patrice Poujol is an EnTech research expert and a film practitioner. He has 8-year experience in the financial sector and movie finance and 12-year experience as a creative consultant and producer in the movie industry. In 2018, he obtained the first PhD worldwide on the integration of blockchain technology in Creative Media (CityU Hong Kong) through an academic exchange with UCLA and a participation in the MEFTI programme organised by MIT.\nDr. Poujol is a member of the Hong Kong Internet Governance Forum (HKIGF) and EnTech public policy postdoctoral research fellow at the centre for Applied Computing and Interactive Media (ACIM – CityU). His book “Online Film Production in China Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts” is published by Springer in 2019.\nDr. Poujol is the founder and CEO of Box Productions and of Lumière (芦明) – a blockchain and smart contract solution to handle transactions and flows of capital faster, cheaper and more transparently into movie productions. The Lumière Project (芦明) is part of the Motion Protocol ecosystem, a global alliance of blockchain and media companies, which has developed working solutions for film professionals throughout the entire production chain from finance to distribution.\nOlga Yaroshevsky: The topic that you cover sounds like something really unique. The intersection of movie making and distribution, blockchain and finance. I really want to know how you’ve managed to put these three together and even conduct a 4-year Phd research on that! Can you please first tell us a little more about yourself, about your background. Is it more film making, or more finance?\nPatrice Poujol: It was a long road, yeah. It’s a point of convergence, of a lot of things. But before I even go down there – there are not a lot of people in this space, yet. I think it’s going to get more crowded and serious. During the ICO everybody came up with a movie idea, I’m not going to give any names, but… people raised a lot of money and burnt it, or got burnt by a market. Sometimes they didn’t have any knowledge in tech or film, sometimes that tried to solve a problem that didn’t even exist, or that they were very unfamiliar with.\nI started when I was a little boy – and that will give you an idea of my age – I was programming video games in BASIC, on an Amstrad 6128. It was a big addiction at the time. I went on a tangent, and fast forwarding for a few years I went on through a banking experience. I did finance projects, credit lines, let’s say – products with very little risk. Then I decided to get my hands dirty, I got a Masters in Film Production in Dublin, in Ireland. At the O’Kane Centre for Film Studies. We had quite significant patrons – for example, Gregory Peck, Martin Scorcese, Neil Jordan, Jim Sheridan, I can’t even name all the patrons we had, it was an amazing way to learn.\nI ended up consulting in film production for several years. At this point, I was geared towards blockchain. I was offered by CityU Hong Kong a possibility to do a PhD research. Everybody at this time, at the end of 2014, was saying that Bitcoin was dead, it was right after the Mt Gox. And I started an extensive research for several years, seeing how could solve problems we had in film with blockchain technology, will it be able to solve any of our problems. I went the other way around, started with the blockchain – okay, what kind of problems can we solve? If we can solve, let’s have a look, is it going to work, and if it’s not working – just leave it. And that’s why I called it a point of convergence – essentially, being a geek in late 80s to becoming a banker in the early 2000s and eventually dedicating myself to what is passion – film. And whether I make films, directing pieces, or whether I help people making films – to me it’s just the same, it’s about getting an idea which is very abstract on the screen, so people can share it and see it. And that is the beauty of cinema – sharing ideas, films, views, and this is something I would like to keep until the end.\nOY: It’s amazing how the universe listens to you, right?\nPP: Yes! Alchemy. The beauty and the architecture of decentralised systems, whether you use blockchain or peer-to-peer, is that it really shows that interconnection. And I think it can bring very interesting and diverse ideas to life.\nOY: Now to the hottest news – I’m talking about Papicha film, about which you made an exciting announcement last week. So, am I getting this right: you’ve securitized rights for this film, correct?\nPP: Yes, we did equity. We wanted to get a project that we would be able to establish that what we and our partners been building actually works, and can work for a full film. When you go to Cannes film festival, I’m talking this year, you got thousands of projects floating around. It is very important in the first steps to choose a right project. Eventually, the idea is to have a platform democratising projects, and if people would not be able to find those projects – we will find them. That’s the endgame. But before we go there, which to me is going to take years, it can’t be done in one day, we’re going to pinpoint projects that are aligned with tech, the needs of what we can do at the moment, also with our ideas, with our values, with the level of budget we can sustain at the moment. It will be growing eventually, but we can’t just take as a first film massive independent commercial movie of 50 or 70 million, that’s unrealistic. It’s like a gamble. We don’t gamble with our partners’ money. «Papicha» came as the obvious choice. We did the grinding work, we went down, we met people, and «Papicha» eventually was an obvious choice, because there was very little risk attached to it. It was a female director with her own opinion, and what she describes in that film, the expression of her film, the way she did it is very much in line with what we wanted to defend. Which is diversity. Which is humanity.\nWe said okay, let’s do this first step and see if it works, and it did. Part of this film is securitised, as we haven’t securitised the whole thing, for two reasons: one, we wanted to see whether this would work, because we don’t want to push people into securitising if they don’t feel comfortable with it. This is quite new. Sometimes people are not necessarily allowed legally invest that way in a film, on a platform, for example. In the US it’s a very stringent regulation, but the moment is changing, so tomorrow could be different. We didn’t want anybody to be disappointed, so we essentially set this up with people who could do it. We didn’t want to force anybody because we think it’s actually contrary to any adoption principles.\nWith «Papicha» we had no idea at the time it was going to go for the Oscar race. It hasn’t been shortlisted yet, so we don’t know what’s going to happen. Once you get an Oscar nomination whether you win it or not is irrelevant, it’s a lottery ticket at this point, and it depends on so many things.\nWe took this film we really believed in, we set up a technology on it. The people who invested in the film, if they sell their participation the night of Oscars, when the film has essentially been nominated, they could sell their part with a profit.\nOn average an independent film, which is what «Papicha» is, makes 40% of their money back. You lose as an investor 60%, it’s a very long process, it takes about two years to get your money back. We’re trying to give a win to everyone involved. Producers can lock the budget for their film, and they get the money that they need. Directors can make a film that they need to make. For investors we’re lowering the risk. We even will reduce the commercial risk, which is the hardest so far.\nI don’t think blockbusters and independent films are competing against each other. Yes, they do in terms of money, time, attention, but they help each other out. Without blockbusters there wouldn’t be independent films, or cinemas. Without independent films we would just be rehashing the same recipe, and people would get bored. They’re totally intertwined.\nWe wanted to make sure that when investors are investing in a film the entry risk is lower, as low as possible.\nOY: Are there any other use cases, any other films that were invested in like this? PP: Like this, to the best of my knowledge, no, not yet.",

The entire cryptocurrency market continued this week's free fall along with the traditional markets seemingly proving once and for all that Bitcoin’s hedge value has been over-stated.\nExhibit 1: Bitcoin Price from Mar 11-13\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nAs the broader global trading markets plummet, equities have fallen triggering the third circuit breaker as the S&P 500 fell 9.5 percent drop on Thursday. This is the second time in a week trading was temporarily halted so that excess volatility could be reined in. The Dow Jones Industrial is down around 10 percent, while the Nasdaq has fallen 9.5 percent.\nCash and Stablecoins Not BTC and Gold\nOnly days ago we published pieces of the ongoing Twitter debate on Bitcoin’s safe haven status as markets worldwide have been gripped by growing fears over recent weeks as the coronavirus disruption ground manufacturing in China to a halt causing bearish global ripple effects and decreasing demand for oil. A break down in the alliance between Russia and the OPEC appears to be the straw that has broken the camel’s back as oil prices took their biggest dive in 30 years.\nIn the digital community, we’ve seen a lot of conversion from cryptocurrency into US backed stablecoins, particularly with Tether. As shown on CoinMarketCap, marketcaps on every stablecoin are up significantly over the last 24 hours.\nExhibit 2: Market Capitalization of Tether in 7 Days\nAs a third circuit breaker was triggered in the markets yesterday causing a second halt to trading this week, it appears that people are not turning to either Bitcoin or Gold in the face of the crisis but cold hard cash and their digital alternatives.",

    "content": "On January 29, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) made a groundbreaking move in the realm of digital currencies by conducting its first cross-border digital dirham transfer. This transfer, amounting to 50 million dirhams (equivalent to $13.6 million), was sent to China utilizing the mBridge central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform.\nThe transfer was overseen by Sheikh Mansour, the chairman of the board of the Central Bank of the UAE, during the golden jubilee celebration of the bank's establishment. This event is not just a significant milestone for the UAE but also a remarkable step in the global advancement of digital currencies.\nThe mBridge platform, introduced in 2021, is a collaborative effort between the central monetary authorities of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the UAE, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlement (BIS). It stands out as the only international collaborative partnership that includes China. The first pilot of Project mBridge was completed in September 2022, and since then, it has onboarded multiple commercial banks from each participating nation to develop its infrastructure and technology.\nmBridge utilizes a single-platform, direct-access architecture, employing the HotStuff+ consensus mechanism to facilitate real-time, peer-to-peer transactions. This innovative approach allows for faster transfers of each participant country’s national digital currency, showcasing the potential of CBDCs in streamlining cross-border payments.\nThe use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology for digital currencies has gained significant interest worldwide. According to a BIS report, nearly 90% of central banks globally are exploring the adoption of CBDCs. Among these, 11 countries have already launched a CBDC, 15 are in the pilot stage, and 26 are in the development phase. This trend indicates a growing acknowledgment of the potential benefits and efficiencies that CBDCs can bring to the global financial system.\nThe success of the UAE's digital dirham transfer via mBridge highlights the increasing integration of blockchain technology in national and international finance, potentially reshaping the future of money transfer and economic transactions globally.",

    "content": "Robinhood Markets Inc’s shares tumbled 15% in after-hours trade as the commission-free brokerage firm saw a $423 million net loss in the last quarter.\nRobinhood said it lost $0.49 per share in the three months that ended in December. While a year before its initial public offering (IPO), Robinhood’s net income was $7 million or $0.01 per share.\nAccording to Reuters, shares of Robinhood sank as much as 15% to $9.98 in extended trading following results. The share price at its IPO in July last year was $38, and its record high in August was $85.\nRobinhood saw an increase in its third set results as a public company with $363 million for the fourth quarter in December 2021, compared to $318 million in 2020.\nHowever, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, the expected revenue was $362.14 million.\nIn accordance with Reuters, the factor contributing to Robinhood’s net loss was the 162% increase in costs during the fourth quarter from the previous year.\nRobinhood Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick attributed much of the costs to share-based compensation and increasing headcount.\n“We think we’re in a really good position to start slowing that from here,” he said.\nTransaction-based revenue from digital currencies jumped 304% to $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, while revenue from equity trading declined 35% to $52 million, Reuters reported.\nSimilar to other start-ups, Robinhood has yet to make a profit following its IPO and even though the company’s revenue showed a positive sign, their monthly active users fell 8% from the previous quarter of 17.3 million.\nAmong other latest updates, Robinhood’s crypto wallet officially went live on January 21, Blockchain.News reported. In doing so, the company has allowed the first 1,000 users to make crypto withdrawals.\nBlockchain.News also added that the first 1,000 people on the waiting list to sign up for a “wallet” can participate in this beta test and can exchange their cryptocurrency from Robinhood with an external crypto wallet.\nRobinhood said that it plans to expand to 10,000 in March, although the number of participants is capped at this stage. The company hopes to roll out the wallet facility to the general public in 2022.",

    "content": "While end-to-end encryption has long been leveraged to deliver privacy and data protection to tech users, US government officials are attempting to find a way to bypass it, under the pretext that illicit activity revolving around child sexual abuse run unmonitored on strongly encrypted platforms.\nDOJ on why it wishes to monitor content\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ), along with the Home Department of the United Kingdom, the Australian Minister for Home Affairs, India, Japan, and other government officials have come together to assess encryption – a process in cryptography used to secure sensitive data and protect it from being intercepted by unauthorized viewers.\nUS lawmakers are saying that although “encryption is an existential anchor of trust in the digital world,” certain aspects of this technology may pose a threat to the public, in particular to “sexually exploited children.” The DOJ alleges that since encryption inhibits legal and government bodies to assess content and review it, criminals, terrorists, and child exploitation rings use platforms with strong encryption to further their illicit activities. The international statement reads:\nThe DOJ also said that tech companies should be responsible for unlawful content that leveraged their services, as it alleges that social media and communications platforms are often used to “groom children online.” DOJ cited an example from 2018, where statistics found that Facebook Messenger was leveraged in many instances to further child sexual abuse material. US government officials stated:\nEARN IT Act – the quest to up web surveillance\nThe international statement backed by many law enforcement and government officials echo the sentiments of the attorney general of the United States, William Barr, who has been actively working on getting the EARN IT Act approved in the United States.\nThe bill targets encryption protection and decrees that government entities and law officials should have the right to assess user content on encrypted sites, to monitor activity, and put an end to child pornography and child abuse. If passed, it would hold platform providers and website owners accountable for content published on their network.\nBlockchain and tech community bite back\nCryptography and industry experts have shunned the bill, criticizing it as a direct threat to privacy. As some blockchain and cryptocurrency platforms leverage encryption for digital transactions, the bill may hinder the crypto industry. Furthermore, internet-regulating bills would hold technology companies and website hosts accountable for content on their platforms. This may subsequently result in censorship and website surveillance being amped up on platforms, with website hosts avoiding legal complications.\nDOJ wants to ramp up cyber security\nHowever, direct implications of encryption technology proposals such as the EARN IT Act still remain unclear, as the DOJ is still assessing the tradeoff of circumventing end-to-end encryption platforms at the expense of user privacy to annihilate threats to public safety, such as child sexual exploitation. The US Department of Justice said:",

    "content": "Binance might have successfully uncovered the brains behind the KyberSwap frontend hack, which was perpetrated last Thursday.\nLargest cryptocurrency exchange by market trading volume, Binance has independently identified two individuals suspected to be the bad actors behind the KyberSwap scam, which led to the loss of over $265,000 in cryptocurrencies belonging to users. CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao took to his Twitter page to announce the hack.\nOn Thursday, 1st September, the decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange platform KyberSwap noticed suspicious activities on its front end and had to shut it down to conduct investigations. Upon completing the investigations, Kyber Network discovered malware had been introduced into its servers. Specifically, a malicious code was sent into its Google Tag Manager (GTM).\nThe code initiated false approvals, which in turn led to the loss of $265,000 in users' funds. Notably, the target of the malicious code was whale accounts with huge amounts of funds in them.\nKyberSwap, which was initially disabled, came back online after less than two hours following a series of checks which ascertained that the bad script had been pulled out. The DeFi exchange scrutinized its front end to decipher the extent of the damage done, the affected wallet addresses, and the attacker's address.\nBig Brother Binance Steps in For Troubled Crypto Firms\nAs compensation, KyberSwap promised the scammers about 15% or approximately $40,000 of the hijacked funds if it is returned. Helping in the investigation, the Binance security team sent its intel to the Kyber Network team and has now started coordinating with law enforcement agencies.\nThis will not be the first time the largest exchange is stepping in to help other troubled crypto firms salvage their platforms. Markedly, Binance helped to recover about $5.8 million from the $625 million stolen from the Axie Infinity's Ronin Bridge when it was attacked a few months ago.\nAll things considered, Binance is recognized for showing proactiveness and offering selfless effort to help investors.\nA community member attested to this when he said, \"Binance is now playing the role of a big brother in the crypto space. Binance has gone beyond securing its platform to securing the entire crypto ecosystem.\"",

    "summary": "Since 2008 when the Bitcoin blockchain was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, the distributed ledger technology has undergone comprehensive progress. Most significantly, the establishment of smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain created an entirely new technological setting. But most of these development efforts face significant roadblocks that limit wide applications of blockchain technology in various industries. With this regard, FCH develops the next-generation blockchain alternative to fix current issues of the distributed ledger technology.",
    "content": "Blockchain technologies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have been rising rapidly in the last years. Generally, each could be seen as a separate step in the evolution of blockchain technology.\nBitcoin that laid the foundation for blockchain technologies can be seen as blockchain 1.0. Its original blockchain support system has facilitated the evolution of further cryptocurrencies.\nWith the introduction of autonomously executing smart contracts and algorithms, Ethereum can be seen as blockchain 2.0. This evolution step formed the foundation of emerging decentralized applications identified as DApps.\nBut both evolution steps have some concerns like scalability, interoperability, and security. For example, the proof-of-work consensus mechanism essential to validate transactions can be time-consuming and energy-intensive. Bitcoin blockchain network only processes about seven transactions per second.\nAnother issue is that cryptocurrency wallets frequently hold the private keys important to access them, therefore potentially exposing the information to cybercriminals.\nOn 31st October 2019, Blockchain.News learned that FCH network is developing the next-generation blockchain alternative that seeks to address those blockchain weaknesses.\nHow Does FCH Network Work?\nFCH blockchain network is poised to take a business-focused approach that improves security, scalability, and efficiency. It is the next-generation blockchain alternative that aims to achieve this mission by making partnerships with other organizations in specific verticals such as mobile wallets to offer wide-ranging solutions for businesses.\nFCH is introducing its Atmos 2.0 protocol in partnership with SignKeys – a secure enterprise wallet provider – and other platforms. Such partnerships will enable businesses to leverage the benefits of blockchain without being slowed down by their limitations.\nFCH is rolling out a new blockchain network as a consortium of companies which will solve not just payment demands, but also other solution verticals.\nFCH network features a scalable, high-performance, and robust blockchain protocol with high-security applications for functions (like tokenization and marketing) and an identity management solution.\nFCH’s Atmos 2.0 Protocol\nFCH’s Atmos 2.0 protocol fixes scalability problems based on its dxPoS (delegated cross-chain proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism. Also, it is compatible with the industry-standard ERC-20 protocol pioneered on the Ethereum blockchain.\nSimilar to PoS-based networks, the FCH network avoids inefficiencies seen in PoW architecture. Also, the system provides rewards to owners holding FCH’s XF tokens with better opportunities to earn cryptocurrency transaction fees for verifying (i.e., validating) new data blocks. Such rewards depend on the amount of the total number of XF tokens they hold.\nFCH’s dxPoS goes further in two steps. First, it safeguards against any single XF holder from getting a majority stake of the total number of tokens. It, therefore, controls the network by putting potential validator candidates to a voting process. On the second note, it houses such a democratic process on the transparent Ethereum network.\nFCH integrates this more secure and efficient solution with the SignKeys Enterprise mobile wallet that validates the identity of delegates and stores their identity attestations on the blockchain using the FCH.ID protocol.\nFCH network uses public infrastructure security to significantly minimize the risk of fraud caused by identity falsification. The SignKeys wallet functions with various credentials like smart devices, passwords, and biometrics, and support anti-money-laundering and EU-standard know-your-customer protocols.\nMoreover, military-grade FIPS 140-2 hardware rooting manages and protects digital keys for stronger authentication. Typically, the military-grade is better than traditional banking systems.\nFCH runs hardware security modules to build a real possibility for businesses to onboard fiat.\nFCH Blockchain Cuts Costs and Improves Efficiency\nDue to its secure innovations, FCH blockchain can scale up to 100,000 transactions per second that is a unique opportunity for businesses.\nFCH network provides real solutions to various applications such as financial inclusion, identity services, B2C and B2B operations, and others.\nFCH solutions allow all business assets to be exchanged and tokenized without intermediaries or central authorities. The blockchain can accommodate a wide variety of mobile platforms like microloan services, marketing flows, and even reward programs.\nFCH’s dxPoS mechanism gives rewards to successful validator delegates with XF tokens, therefore enabling them to subsidize transaction costs for their customers and even provide free transactions.\nBusinesses that utilize the SignKeys and FCH blockchain also get peace of mind from FCH’s guaranteed of asset-backed currencies it holds. Currently, the wallet supports more than 250+ cryptocurrencies and not limited to cryptocurrencies assisting bridging the gap between non-blockchain solutions.\nBesides that, FCH blockchain solves issues such as privacy, scalability, and “too hard to use” problem associated with blockchain application.\nFCH Blockchain Helps Enterprises Get More Customers and Grow Their Businesses\nFCH is a fintech solution, which is well-positioned to help businesses and enterprises leverage the efficiencies of the blockchain with zero weaknesses. Moreover, partnerships beyond affiliating with SignKeys are beginning to boost FCH’s outreach.\nOne of the partners is CoreLedger, an exchange and tokenization platform. It is a company that combines an asset-trading platform, tokenization, and a specific type of exchange. The company is already working with many established organizations like commodity-type exchanges and banks that will be running on FCH protocol.\nAlso, FCH is expanding front-to-back solutions, which for example is supporting the work of a well-known marketing firm. FCH is doing the tech for the marketing firm while the firm does the last mile for microloan services to reach the unbanked. FCH then helps to power the last mile to reach potential customers of the marketing firm.

Toddkramer.eth.\nKramer reported on Twitter that his collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs worth $1.9 million was \"hacked\" and stolen.\nAccording to several reports, one Clonex, seven Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and eight Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs currently valued at about 615 ETH ($2.28 million) were stolen and are now not able to be traded on OpenSea.\nKramer announced on Twitter that he had clicked on a link that appeared to be an NFT decentralized application, but it turned out to be a phishing attack and 16 of his NFTs were stolen after the hackers gained access to his hot wallet. “I been hacked, all my apes gone,” he Tweeted.\nA hot wallet is a type of cryptocurrency software wallet that is connected to the internet — most commonly MetaMask — whenever the device it is installed on is connected.\nNFTs are cryptographically unique digital tokens that prove ownership of physical or digital content such as art, GIFs or music file. Bored Ape Yacht Club is one of the most popular PFP (profile picture) collections, a series of cartoon ape images with randomly-generated attributes.\nSome people have argued that appealing to a third party to freeze NFTs went against the core idea of decentralization, one of the cherished aspects of the crypto industry.\nAmong many others voicing out their criticism towards the lack of decentralization, famed software engineer Grady Booch chimed saying, “silly me. And here I thought that the code is the law and that one of the very ideas of cryptocurrencies was the elimination of any possibility of centralized intervention.\"\nPredeccosers of Kramer's in the phishing scam came on Dec 26, when NFT collector bergpay.eth said he suffered a similar fate when 5 Jungle Freaks and 2 Sandbox NFTs were stolen from his Ethereum wallet and his ENS domain was transferred to a new address.\nAccording to a report by Decrypt, in the wider crypto space, phishing is a growing problem, with cybersecurity company PhishLabs reporting a tenfold increase in such attacks on crypto exchanges in the first half of 2021 compared to a year earlier.\nWith the rise of popularity and monetary value in NFTs, hackers have begun to sense this opportunity to make big money.\nAmong top phishing attacks this year, tens of thousands of dollars worth of NFTs were reported stolen from the Nifty Gateway marketplace by cyber thieves in March, while in August, pseudonymous developer Stazie lost 16 CryptoPunks NFTs to a phishing attack involving a malicious pop-up.",

The information recorded will then be shared with government agencies, WWF, and other third-party organizations after paying for it.\nBy leveraging on Stream’s blockchain network, the Tracey app will enable poor fishers to get rewards for their catch. Expressly, Stream is an open-source project that utilizes real-time inputs to monetize data.\nThe Tracey app also supports a stable coin called Peso that was launched by UnionBank. It will also be instrumental in granting every fisher with a credit score based on their catch data, and this will act as the basis to access microfinance.\nSusan Roxas, the Fisheries and Finance Lead for WWF’s Coral Triangle Program, acknowledged: “Small fishers in many coastal countries remain poor despite the high-value fish they catch, like yellowfin tuna.”\nThe blockchain-enabled app is set to alter this by providing fishers with financial support.",

According to Binance, DeFi and NFT projects are among the good options.\nAccording to Binance, as previously revealed by CZ, choosing DeFi and NFT is a safer approach.\nWhile in an interview with Bloomberg on October 8, CZ confirmed that Binance has spent more than $1 billion to invest in the quarter in 2022.\nIn early October, Binance poured $325 million into 67 projects such as Aptos or Sui. Along with that, the company has also spent $200 million to invest in Forbes' media company.\nFurthermore, Binance has also contributed $500 million to the plan to buy Twitter of billionaire Elon Musk.\nAccording to Binance, compared to 2021, the company has only spent $140 million on 73 projects, even though the crypto winter has lasted longer than expected. It shows that Binance's investments have increased significantly, along with the size of the investments.\nOther investments made by Binance include the NFT ecosystem and fan tokens, along with traditional payment service providers.\nBinance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange on a global scale. It offers a platform with over 350 cryptocurrencies to trade, 120 million users and a 24-hour trading volume worth $76 billion.

Sun sat down with Blockchain.News at the Blockshow Asia 2019 to discuss Huobi’s rising profile, China’s decentralized economy and what she considers fair metrics for ranking exchanges.",
    "content": "Huobi Group is a leading global digital asset financial service provider with a stated mission of “empowering financial services and liberating global wealth” coupled with the concept of putting the needs of their users first. In October 2017, Huobi initiated its global strategic layout with the establishment of the Huobi Korea Team and the start of its official operations. Two months later, Huobi Global was officially launched and started operations with a first month cumulative turnover in excess of 4.6 billion USD.\nCiara Sun, Head of Global Business Development & Partnerships at Huobi Group, has a wealth of experience in financial analysis, strategic consulting, and corporate management from her previous roles with prestigious enterprises such as Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte Consulting, and Ernst & Young. She collaborated with Banking and Capital Markets group for 15 major banks, performed investment analytics to support clients managing billions of dollars of assets - including hedge funds, private equity firms, and investment management corporations.\nSun sat down with Blockchain.News at the Blockshow Asia 2019 to discuss Huobi’s rising profile, China’s decentralized economy, and what she considers fair metrics for ranking exchanges.\nHuobi Global\nHuobi Global is a revolutionary blockchain-based service provider operating 24/7. It has emerged as one of the market leaders in crypto-exchange. Sun said, “We are active in many countries in three different ways—we have the Huobi Global which accepts customers from most major countries except Japan and the US. We also have local exchanges that are 100% owned by the Huobi Group in the US, Korea, and we recently got the license for Japan. We also have another way of penetrating different markets through Huobi Cloud, which are joint venture exchanges with local partners. Local partners include Huobi Argentina, Huobi Russia, Huobi Indonesia, and Huobi Thailand, among others.\nSun highlighted compliance and working with the regulations as one of the keys to Huobi’s incredible success. She said, “As I mentioned, we have set up all the separate local entities within these countries to deal with their specific regulation.”\nOn Oct. 25, President Xi Jinping called for the acceleration of blockchain development and adoption in China. Sun said, “When President Xi endorsed blockchain technology, it created a lot of amazing opportunities for us as well as some challenges. We have a Chinese entity - Huobi China - it’s blockchain solutions and education entity that will roll out over 100 educational sessions for different government departments and large corporations in China.”\nRevenue + Accumulated Assets > Liquidity?\nHuobi Global consistently ranks in the top ten for exchanges in terms of trading volume and is recognized as one of the largest and most prominent in the world. Exchange rankings were a hot topic this year as CoinMarketCap (CMC) recently announced its new liquidity metric being integrated to combat rampant wash trading detected within exchanges. While Sun acknowledged that trading volume was “really easy” to fake, she believes that there are two fairways to rank exchanges.\nThe first is revenue, Sun explained, “Exchanges are businesses, which means revenue is the percentage of your trading volume - so if an exchange is just trading with zero-fee accounts, it will probably have the highest trading volume, but it won’t actually be reflected in revenue, and that’s very easy to check.”\nAccording to Sun, the second way she would propose to rank an exchange is by the assets that are accumulated. She explained, “Exchanges are different than wallets. The assets you deposit onto an exchange are there for trading purposes, so I think measuring these two factors would be a fair way to rank exchanges.”\nChina’s Future Decentralized Economy\nHuobi Group recently developed Huobi Chain, a regulator-friendly, high-performance open-source, public chain that allows enterprises, financial institutions, and exchanges to deploy their own blockchains, tokenized assets, and DeFi services. The high-performance public chain was developed in partnership with Nervos to be publicly available to the entire developer community. Blockchain developers, partners, enterprises, and regulators can access the code on Github, track the project's progress, and openly contribute to the development of Huobi Chain.\n“The project is a public open-source chain, so we partnered with Nervos, who has been doing some really great work, “ said Sun, “From next year, it will support a variety of decentralized applications known as Dapps.”\nHuobi Cracks Turkey\nThere are no all-encompassing global compliance standards for exchanges and set up in each different country means dealing with specific compliance requirements and regulations. Sun said, “There are many challenges when dealing with the different government regulators and setting up bank accounts for our business.” She added, “There is also a cultural factor that we must contend with, besides teaching the local user base to understand the value of our product and earning their trust.”\nOn Oct. 18, Huobi Global announced plans for Turkey at the Eurasia Blockchain Summit, starting with the coming launch of a Turkish Lira (TRY) fiat gateway, providing Turkish users an accessible gateway to trade more than 250 digital assets with greater liquidity.\nTurkey has evolved into a thriving crypto-friendly nation and a theater of commerce for exchanges and blockchain businesses. In Sept. 2018, the Turkish government revealed plans to create a national blockchain infrastructure to aid the public deployment of distributed ledger technology.\n“We are 100% confident in Turkey, and we have very strong local partners working with us as well who oversee the entire Middle East and North Africa market. We have set up our offices with a strong round of recruitment targeting staff with rich experience in working with the financial regulators.” she said, “Turkey is a really great market. I was really surprised to discover that 20% of the population owns cryptocurrency, and the Lira is the fifth most popular fiat currency for crypto pairing in the world.”\nHuobi Japan FPG\nHuobi Group merged with BitTrade to open Huobi Japan as a fully regulated exchange under Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA). According to Sun, “This is only the seventh license ever to be given to an exchange validated by the FSA in Japan.”\nThe license gives Huobi a huge advantage over many other global exchanges, as Japan is notoriously a difficult market to achieve regulatory approval. “We will be helping a lot of projects get their assets listed for trading.”\nThe expansion into Turkey and Japan is in line with one of Huobi’s major strategies going forward, which is to increase its percentage of the overseas trading volume. Sun said, “We are looking at a lot of interesting areas and have plans to move into South Africa in 2020.”",

This sandbox initiative is set to explore a number of defined use cases with respect to asset tokenisation on the blockchain.\nProject Guardian was floated in partnership with DBS Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Marketnote. Per the announcement, the MAS and its partners will “test the feasibility of applications in asset tokenisation and DeFi while managing risks to financial stability and integrity.” The project will explore use cases in 4 categories, including Open, interoperable networks, Trust anchors, Asset tokenisation, and Institutional grade DeFi protocols.\nWithin the context of its announcement, the MAS defined tokenisation as “the process of digitally representing assets or items of value through a smart contract on a blockchain. This allows high value financial and real economy assets to be fractionalised and exchanged over the internet on a peer-to-peer basis.”\nPer its goals, the Singapore banking regulator seeks avenues whereby the emerging DeFi and smart contract governed finance services world will be brought under appropriate regulatory oversight in a bid to provide encompassing benefits to all industry participants.\n“MAS is closely monitoring innovations and growth in the digital asset ecosystem and working through the potential opportunities and risks that come with new technologies - to consumers, investors and the financial system at large. Through practical experimentation with the financial industry and the broader ecosystem, we seek to sharpen our understanding of this rapidly transforming digital assets ecosystem. The learnings from Project Guardian will serve to inform policy markets on the regulatory guardrails that are needed to harness the benefits of DeFi while mitigating its risks,” said Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer MAS.\nWhile it defined the 4 primary areas it wishes to focus its exploration on, the MAS said additional innovations can be shared by industry participants provided they align with the overall goal it aims to achieve, a move that is contrary to earlier attempts to tighten anything crypto business activities.",

    "content": "The coronavirus pandemic has currently reached countless countries and territories all over the world and has caused over 220,000 infections in the world population. With the global death rate climbing and almost reaching 9,000, the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic on March 11.\nMany countries have encouraged employers to adopt a work-from-home system, while schools have been closed in many cities in hopes of curbing the spread of the coronavirus. Many countries have also closed their borders and implemented travel restrictions and alerts to slow down the rate of the spread.\nWith the alarming rate of new cases, technological advancements have been emerging to help governments to detect new and record new cases. Chinese President Xi Jinping previously suggested that the fight against the new virus has highlighted the need for a better governance mechanism, suggesting blockchain technology should be integrated into the existing system to gain better insights into social circumstances.\nThe Public Health Blockchain Consortium (PHBC) has announced the launch of a monitoring blockchain aimed to verify communities and workplaces that are free from the coronavirus COVID-19, as well as other high-risk viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The Consortium consists of health authorities, universities, healthcare providers, and innovators who aim to collect and store anonymous health data on the blockchain, to improve the lives of people in the world. The blockchain monitor would help identify safe zones where there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus.\nData would be stored and updated in real-time using blockchain, and the information will be received from surveillance providers who use a combination of technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and geographical information systems.\nAyon Hazra, the CEO of Qlikchain, administrator for the PHBC explained, “Communities and workplaces can maintain such safe zone status if they restrict access to anonymously identified persons and only allow movement to and from other safe zones. This method enables communities and workplaces to effectively protect uninfected persons.”\nThe method suggests an incentive for communities and workplaces to restrict access and conduct proper testing to keep its status as a safe zone. Hazra mentioned that the individuals and communities from the safe zones would be able to restrict their movement safely according to the information provided by the blockchain monitor.\nThe blockchain monitor also tracks the protection certificates offered by the regulatory authorities to workplaces and communities, detecting of an individual in the safe zone who has possibly been in one of the infected areas, a quarantine requirement will be alerted.\nWith the PHBC virus-free monitoring blockchain being introduced to public health officials in Geneva on February 10, 2020, the impact of the technology will be presented after a year at the PHBC’s 2021 conference.",

    "title": "Global Supply Chain Financing: A New Era of Resilience and Diversification",
    "summary": "Citi's 2024 report on supply chain financing highlights a shift towards resilience and diversification in global trade, emphasizing technological innovations and the adoption of the China Plus One strategy.",
    "content": "The latest report from Citi, titled \"Supply Chain Financing – Building Resilience as the New Definition of 'Global' Emerges,\" offers a comprehensive insight into the evolving landscape of global trade and supply chains. Published on January 22, 2024, this report marks the fourth edition of the Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS) series and stands as a testament to the transformative changes in global trade dynamics.\nTransformative Technological Innovations and Resilience\nJane Fraser, CEO of Citi, highlights the crucial role of transformative technological innovations in increasing resilience across global supply chains. This focus on resilience is driven by a universal pursuit of security across various domains like food, water, energy, cyber, financial, and operational. The report underscores a significant shift in the reconfiguration of supply chains to meet customer demands and stakeholder expectations. This shift is not only reshaping global trade but is also fostering economic growth.\nAdoption of China Plus One Strategy\nA notable finding in the report is the adoption of the 'China Plus One' strategy by over half of the global respondents, especially in North America. This strategy involves diversifying supply chains by incorporating an additional sourcing destination alongside China, with Vietnam emerging as the preferred alternative. This trend indicates a conscious effort by companies and nations to diversify their supply chain partners, thereby building new trade corridors and enhancing resilience.\nTechnological Developments in Trade Finance\nChris Cox, Global Head of Trade and Working Capital Solutions at Citi, emphasizes the central role of technology in trade finance. Innovations like artificial intelligence and blockchain are revolutionizing trade finance by enhancing operational efficiency, reducing costs, mitigating fraud, and improving transparency. These advancements are pivotal in improving access to efficient capital globally, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies in emerging markets.\nThe Evolving Nature of Global Supply Chains\nThe Citi report delves into the evolution of global supply chains, highlighting the shift towards a new era of diversification. This transformation is evident in various ways:\nThe emergence of smaller players in global trade, particularly last-mile suppliers in developing countries.\nDiversified economies spurred by increased investments in supply chains, as seen in countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\nThe creation of new trade corridors, exemplified by Brazil’s increased trade with India and China and the Middle East’s stronger connections with Asia.\nThe report acknowledges that while significant progress has been made, the transformation of supply chains is a gradual process, requiring time to build new relationships and achieve scale.\nChallenges and Opportunities Ahead\nDespite the easing of supply chain pressures since the peak in 2021, the report acknowledges ongoing challenges such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. However, these challenges also present opportunities for smaller suppliers to engage more actively in global trade. The report advocates for continued collaboration on global solutions, emphasizing the need for standardization, technological integration, and regulatory harmonization to enhance supply chain resilience.",

The significant difference that Walmart indicates is that the proposed cryptocurrency will be able to provide a zero or low-fee marketplace for users to keep financial reserves. These reserves can be converted to cash and could be used at designated retail stores.\nAlthough there are currently regulatory certainties, Walmart indicated that it is envisioning the creation of an “open-platform value for purchases and crowdsourcing work.” Walmart has also been working on blockchain projects such as food safety along with IBM, supply chain management, customer marketplaces, smart appliances throughout the last few years.",

    "content": "Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, is purchasing more contactless ATMs that are powered by blockchain. The banking giant is making this move despite an upcoming bill that aims to penalize individuals and firms that use and trade cryptocurrencies.\nThe bank rides the blockchain wave\nThe banking institution just intends to cut the need for physical contact associated with the use of bank debit/credit cards amid the coronavirus pandemic. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, Sberbank has preferred to cut down the use of plastic cards due to health concerns.\nThe banking giant intends to buy 5,000 contactless ATMs within a framework of a tender that is worth over $100 million.\nThe news report further indicated that the blockchain-powered devices will support many contactless payment systems, including Samsung Pay, Huawei Pay, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The ATMs will also be compatible with Mir Pay, which is the Central bank of Russia’s contactless payment platform.\nEach ATM will have the capacity of storing 14,500 banknotes, powered by blockchain technology, which provides security features including intelligent monitoring, theft and vandal-proof system and pattern recognition software. Instead of customers interacting with touchscreens, they will be able to use the new contactless ATM machines via their smartphones.\nSberbank is a big fan of blockchain technology for business innovation. The bank’s official spokesperson mentioned that the use of advanced technology will attract new customers and assist in reducing costs.\nAround two years ago, Sberbank launched a blockchain lab to examine promising applications for trials and use for various tasks. In November last year, Sberbank became the first bank in Russia to acquire a patent for a system that converts repurchase redemption (repo) transactions into smart contracts on blockchain.\nToday, the banking institution has about 75,000 ATMs across Russia, and 55,000 of them are fully-featured ATMs throughout the country.\nPer the news report, Sberbank also plans to add new functionality to the new ATMs including stock market trades, e-commerce orders, and contact-free loan applications. VTB Bank, Sberbank's main competitor, also announced that it plans to launch a cash-withdrawal system, which uses smartphone technology for Google Pay and Apple Pay withdrawals.\nRussia’s central bank will ban crypto issuance and trading in upcoming “digital financial asset” bill\nRussian authorities said that they will not legalize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a means of payment in the country and are still working in ways to regulate crypto transactions without fully banning them. In March 2020, the central bank of Russia disclosed that the upcoming bill on digital financial assets will ban the circulation and issuance of cryptos. Alexey Guznov, the head of the legal department at Bank of Russia, said that the central bank does not believe that cryptocurrency issuance and trading should be legal in the country.\nThe original bill on digital financial assets was passed in 2018, which stated that trading of cryptocurrencies was legal in Russia. However, Guznov disclosed that the amended bill would ban the selling and issuance of cryptocurrencies in the country. The amended bill would ban almost everything about crypto with the exception of holding cryptocurrencies.\nThe upcoming law seems controversial because it seeks to ban institutions from using, issuing, and trading cryptos, but people can hold cryptocurrencies. The consensus was reached with market players and various government bodies regarding the upcoming law. The consensus reached stated that nobody is going to ban owning (holding) of cryptocurrencies.\nAlexey Guznov said that owning crypto is not like owning drugs or arms. He stated that legalizing cryptocurrencies is a big risk because Russian authorities and the central bank appear to associate crypto-related transactions with money laundering criminal activities.\nThe pending bill has been facing delay for more than two years now. Guznov revealed that the bill might finally be passed during this spring session. In 2018, Sberbank started trading cryptocurrencies outside the country so that to avoid violating domestic rules. Russian laws bar the bank from trading cryptos but the state-controlled bank looks for ways to serve customers in popular markets for some investors.",

IBM now holds six out of the eleven committee seats which has raised concerns about the tech giant’s new found influence on the enterprise blockchain consortium.\nOf the six IBM employees: five work for IBM directly and one seat is occupied by Mark Wagner, a senior principal engineer at the IBM subsidiary Red Hat. In 2018, the TSC had only two IBM representatives and the same number of total seats. Wagner was serving on the committee at the time, but IBM did not acquire Red Hat until July 2019. The new committee will begin governing following the election of the new TSC chair next week.\nThe Hyperledger TSC is responsible for creating working groups to focus on technical issues, approving projects and reviewing updates. Although IBM has been a major player in Hyperledger since its inception, the results are making many from rival firms uneasy as IBM will now have the numbers to steer the committee in its favor.\nAt stake is the direction of one of the three most widely adopted enterprise blockchain platforms, the others being R3’s Corda and variants of the Ethereum blockchain.\nLow voter turnout was also raised as a reason to mistrust IBM’s dominance on the committee, with only 33 percent of Hyperledger members casting ballots.\nIBM has not yet offered any comment.",

    "summary": "Hamilton Lane is making three investment funds available to individual investors by tokenizing part of its $835 billion funds via a partnership with Securitize.",
    "content": "Hamilton Lane, a global private markets investment firm, formed a partnership deal with digital asset securities firm Securitize to tokenize three of its investment funds on Wednesday.\nThrough the partnership, funds to be tokenized include unlisted equities, private credit, and secondary transactions.\nHamilton Lane, which has $835 billion in assets under management, plans to give qualified U.S.-based investors access to funds through providing exposure to direct equities, private credit, and secondary transactions, which will be tokenized via Securitize's blockchain-based digital transfer agency.\nHamilton's tokenized funds are expected to be available by the fourth quarter, enabling a broader investor base to access the funds. Customers will still need to be accredited, which means those with a net worth of more than $1 million or income above $200,000.\nVictor Jung, Head of Digital Assets at Hamilton Lane, commented about the development: \"This collaboration with Securitize is our latest step toward enabling access to the strong returns and performance opportunities generated within the private markets space for a newer set of investors while increasing usability and transparency through the use of blockchain technology.\"\nThe new tokenized funds highlight Hamilton's commitment to expanding ease of access to the private markets through the use of blockchain technology. Private-equity investments are generally accessible only to institutional investors or ultra-high-net-worth investors. But blockchain has opened up the access of private-market strategies to retail investors.\nTherefore, converting funds into security tokens enables individual investors to place money in assets previously only accessible to institutions. It reduces issuance and administration costs and enables fractional ownership.\nHamilton Lane's move follows the announcement last month when KKR tapped blockchain technology further to open its private equity strategy to individual investors. The developments signal a series of asset management firms using intermediaries to expand access to funds to high net-worth individuals and accredited investors.\nOther asset managers, like Partners Group, Investcorp, and Temasek-backed Mapletree, also tokenized their funds recently, as they know that individual investors will increasingly drive their growth investments.",

We’ve gathered sufficient insights and evidence to support the case, in terms of technical as well as operational viability, for the wider implementation of the process in the organic cotton industry. In addition, the process shows enormous potential for further expansion to include other fibers in the fashion supply chain.”\nOrganic cotton is favored because it promotes healthy ecosystems, people, and soils. Additionally, it is a key fiber when it comes to sustainability strategies fronted by global fashion brands.\nOrganic cotton is also environmentally friendly because it presents a lower ecological impact because of minimal chemical usages, such as insecticides and pesticides. The blockchain pilot project will propel the adoption of organic cotton because of the traceability and transparency presented.",

    "summary": "Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based developer of blockchain gaming technology, has reduced its target for its metaverse fund by 20% to $800 million due to volatility in the crypto sector. The company's market capitalization has also fallen from $6 billion to below $2 billion, signaling a change in sentiment in the crypto industry.",
    "content": "In recent news, Animoca Brands has reportedly reduced its target for its metaverse fund by a further 20% to $800 million, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company has scaled back on its billion-dollar goal due to the volatility in the crypto sector. Animoca Brands had previously announced in November 2022 that it was working on a new Animoca Capital fund with a target of $2 billion, but then halved that target to $1 billion in January 2023.\nTwo sources familiar with the matter disclosed that Animoca Brands' market capitalization, which was previously valued at roughly $6 billion following a Temasek-led financing round in July 2022, has fallen to below $2 billion. The sources also shared that the company's shares are trading at a considerably lower valuation in secondary markets. The decreased fundraising target and declining valuation signal a change in sentiment on the crypto industry, as excitement around such technologies has dwindled following scandals ranging from the collapse of FTX to the bankruptcy of several crypto lenders.\nIn 2022, Animoca Brands was named the most funded metaverse developer by Nasdaq, with Animoca having the most metaverse deals in 2022, closing 15 deals and receiving over $564 million in funding. As a prominent player in the metaverse industry, Animoca Brands holds a majority stake in The Sandbox, a leading metaverse platform. Apart from this investment, the company has actively participated in developing nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and GameFi.\nYat Siu, one of Animoca Brands' co-founders, has stated that GameFi is expected to become one of the main gateways for the general public to access the metaverse. With the decreasing target for its metaverse fund and declining market capitalization, Animoca Brands' focus may shift towards developing GameFi and other related projects.\nIt is worth noting that the metaverse has been a hot topic in the tech industry, with companies like Facebook and Roblox investing heavily in it. However, the hype around the metaverse has been tempered by concerns about its potential impact on privacy, security, and social inequality. As the metaverse industry evolves, it will be interesting to see how companies like Animoca Brands adapt and navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.",

Huobi said leveraged investments products and contracts would “temporarily” not available to new users from “serval countries and regions”, but the company did not reveal which regions would be affected. Reuters reported Monday, citing the statement through its Telegram channel on Sunday night, that all Huobi custody business has been halted.\n“Meanwhile, we are contacting overseas service providers to pave the way for exports of mining rigs in the future,” Huobi Mall said through its official Telegram social media and asked clients “not to worry and calm down.”\nMeanwhile, BTC.Top, a crypto mining pool, also announced the suspension of its China business, citing regulatory risks.\nFounder Jiang Zhuoer replied to his post on Weibo last Saturday that BTC.Top will mainly focus on conducting crypto mining business in North America in the future.\n“In the long term, nearly all Chinese crypto mining rigs will be sold overseas, as Chinese regulators crackdown on mining at home,” he wrote. Jiang also criticized that China “will lose the crypto computing power to foreign markets as well.”, referring to the ban of a crypto exchange in China since 2017.\nVirtual currency mining in China reportedly contributes to global crypto supply by as much as 70%. However, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and the State Council committee said last Friday in a statement that tightening crypto regulation was necessary to “crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading behaviour” for protecting the financial system. The country will prevent the “transmission of individual risk to the social field”. Three Chinese regulatory units, including NIFA, CBA, and PCAC, also prohibited banks and financial firms early from providing cryptocurrencies transaction services.",

He mentioned that he believes that regulations have a significant impact on cryptocurrency adoption. “I strongly and fully believe that the more favorable they are to the blockchain industry, the better the country will develop this market and increase the likelihood of becoming the leaders of the financial world tomorrow.”\nRussia sees surge in Bitcoin popularity\nA recent study noted that Bitcoin trading and exchange volumes have been surging in the country’s local exchanges, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. With the lack of income due to self-isolation and business operations coming to a halt, analysts believe traders and new investors are looking at cryptocurrencies.",

    "summary": "Chiliz Chain introduces Tokenomics 2.0, enhancing utility and blockchain longevity with an 8.80% base rate and token burn mechanism, aiming for a minimum annual yield of 5.72% APY.",
    "content": "Chiliz Chain Tokenomics Evolution\nIn a recent update, the Chiliz Chain, a sport blockchain protocol for sports and entertainment, has rolled out its Tokenomics 2.0. This shift, marking the end of the blockchain's inaugural year, brings significant changes to the economic strategy of its native digital currency, $CHZ.\nDetailed Inflationary Framework\nThe updated tokenomics, introduced at the start of 2024, entails an initial annual base inflation of 8.80%, with a calculated year-over-year decay. This decay is governed by a specific formula, y = 9.24e(-0.250x) + 1.60, which anticipates a gradual reduction of inflation that will eventually stabilize at 1.88% in the 14th year. The token's supply is expected to experience a shift towards a deflationary model if the burn rate of transaction fees surpasses the annual inflation rate.\nAllocation and Utility Enhancement\nWith 65% of the inflation supply designated for validators and delegators, the Chiliz Chain ensures significant rewards for those involved in network governance and security. An additional 10% is allocated to the Community Vault, $CHZ Liquidity Pools, and Shared Security Restaking Rewards. The remaining 25% is directed towards Ecosystem and Operational Distribution, underscoring the platform's commitment to continuous development and support for ecosystem projects.\nStrategic Implications\nThe strategic update is aimed at fostering sustainable growth and enhancing the utility of the $CHZ token. By aligning with the economic strategies of leading Layer 1 protocols, the Chiliz Chain is positioning itself for increased community engagement and long-term viability within the competitive blockchain industry.\nThe introduction of EIP-1559 also plays a crucial role in the new tokenomics, where a majority of the gas fees will be burned at the protocol level, potentially leading to a deflationary supply model in the future.",

    "title": "Indian Bill To Ban Cryptocurrency Excluded From Winter Parliament Agenda",
    "summary": "The bill to ban cryptocurrency trade in India has been left of its parliamentary winter session agenda, fueling speculation that there has been a change in strategy.",
    "content": "The latest news indicates that the government of India will not be deliberating on the cryptocurrency bill during the winter session of parliament as was previously planned. On Nov. 14 2019, the Lok Sabha – India’s lower house of parliament – released the tentative list of bills which the government is expected to introduce and pass during the upcoming winter session.\nWhile the “Personal Data Protection Bill” is included in the session agenda, the “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019” is missing.\nGood News as Crypto Bill Delayed\nIndia’s government has been considering the need for passing the crypto bill to ban cryptocurrencies in the country. In August 2019, the government told the country’s supreme court that the bill may be introduced in the winter session of parliament.\nHowever, the lower house of India’s parliament published the agenda for the winter session that does not include the cryptocurrency bill. The winter session begins on 18th November and ends on 13th December.\nThe crypto community welcomes the delay of the cryptocurrency ban. The CEO of local cryptocurrency exchange Pockebits – Sohail Merchant – said that the draft bill to ban cryptocurrencies is not on the agenda for the parliament winter session.\nHe considered this as a relief for now. But he emphasized that now it is time for the local crypto community to come together and present their case to the regulators.\nAlso, Wazirx crypto exchange CEO – Nischal Shetty – regarded this as great news for the cryptocurrency ecosystem of India. He described the move by the India government not to include the draft bill to ban cryptocurrencies in the upcoming parliament session as great. He sees the India government as listening since they are not rushing to ban crypto in the country.\nThe Legislative Process\nThe bill seeking to ban all digital currencies except state-owned cryptocurrencies was made by the IMC (Interministerial Committee) chaired by Subhash Chandra Garg – the Former Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The bill was submitted to the Finance Ministry in February 2019 and made public in July.\nFollowing the government’s intention to introduce this bill in the parliament’s winter session, the supreme court postponed the hearing of all petitions associated with the country’s cryptocurrency policies until January next year.\nIndia is among the five BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) thinking to launch a new cryptocurrency to enable cross-border money transfer between the member nations.\nRenewed Push for Community Unity\nSince the cryptocurrency bill was made public, the crypto community in India has been actively campaigning for the government to reconsider the recommendations. The community emphasizes that the bill is flawed.\nFor example, Sohail Merchant – Pockebits CEO – urged all stakeholders within the crypto industry to forget emotions and competition, but to echo their thoughts with a single voice.\nEarlier this month, several cryptocurrency stakeholders gathered at an event identified as “Unwind with Crypto”. The meeting aimed to bring all the important stakeholders within the crypto industry together and develop a stronger global community.\nThe pioneers of the blockchain and crypto industry attended the meeting. Among them include crypto Kannon’s Kashif Raza who mentioned that it is unfortunate that despite the utmost efforts of the crypto community, the Central Bank of India still appears confused concerning the widespread power of crypto assets.\nMeanwhile, investors in the industry have widely criticized India’s potential to ban cryptocurrencies. In October 2019, Tim Draper – billionaire venture capitalist – called on Prime minster Narendra Modi to rethink the country’s hostile stance of cryptocurrency. He mentioned that India is leaving itself vulnerable by trying to ban cryptocurrencies.\nA report shows that India risks facing loses of an estimated $12.9 billion if it bans cryptocurrencies.",

    "summary": "Decentralized network operators get 7.26% annually.",
    "content": "On February 9, according to information provided by DefiLlama, the Ethereum staking service Rocket Pool surpassed a total value locked (TVL) of one billion dollars. This development takes place a little under two years following the introduction of the mainnet for the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on November 9, 2021. Rocket Pool, which offers what is known as a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, gives customers the option to either join an existing Ethereum decentralized node operator or to operate their own node.\nUsers are able to run their own node with just 16 Ether (ETH), as opposed to the network-specified 32 ETH, and another 16 ETH comes from a pool of users who join a decentralized node operator. This is a significant improvement over traditional staking solutions, as the capital requirements are significantly lower. The latter has a far lower minimum deposit requirement of only 0.01 ETH. In return for their ETH, depositors are given a liquid staking token known as rETH. This token serves as evidence that the user is eligible for staking rewards over time and accumulates yield.\nRocket Pool node operators are eligible to collect up to 7.26% annually in compensation for verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Stakers, however, are eligible to get 4.68%. Both of these rates are subject to change and are dependent on the demand and supply of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain in addition to the total number of transactions. Alterations in the price that ETH is selling for on the market may either make incentives obsolete or make them more valuable.\nAt this time, there are 385,344 ETH invested in the protocol, and there are 2,068 node operators. The smart contracts used by Rocket Pool have been examined by Sigma Prime, ConsenSys, and Trail of Bits respectively. In addition to that, Immunefi is in charge of running the project's bug bounty program. The creators of Ethereum have said that the Shanghai update to the blockchain would most likely become operational in the month of March. Since the network made the successful switch to proof-of-stake in September 2022, users will be able to withdraw any ETH that they have staked as well as any prizes that they have accumulated.",

    "content": "Paxos Trust Company announced on Oct. 28 that it will go ahead with the launch of its blockchain-enabled Paxos Settlement Service and will begin processing transactions for certain listed U.S. equity securities after receiving ‘No-Action relief’ from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe letter from the SEC clearly stated that, “the Staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Paxos” should they operate within the parameters they set out in their request for registration. While essentially giving Paxos the green light, the SEC’s letter also clearly stipulated that at this stage, “No more than seven (7) participants will be eligible to use the Paxos Settlement Service for clearance and settlement and the participants will be required to satisfy the criteria for participation.”\nEuropean banks Credit Suisse and Société Générale will be among the first to use the Paxos Settlement Service and will also be among the first to settle U.S. equities outside of the legacy infrastructure for the first time in 50 years. The innovative blockchain product will remove intermediaries and allow two parties to bilaterally settle securities trades directly with each other which will significantly reduce transaction fees and give permissioned-users access to capital that would historically be trapped in the legacy systems.\nTaking the First Step\nAccording to Charles Cascarilla, CEO and Co-Founder, Paxos, the U.S. equities business is facing unprecedented consolidation and economic pressure which requires comprehensive changes to the legacy structures. He sees the Paxos Settlement Service as an important first step in reimagining the post-trade structure.\nHe concluded the press release stating, Cascarilla added, \"We look forward to working with our early adopter partners to further develop the ecosystem. Together, we'll create financial benefits and achieve operational efficiencies with blockchain technology that will facilitate an open financial system. We're starting with U.S. listed equities, but this technology can be scale to many asset classes across geographies and for all types of clients.\"",

Within the declaration was also a proposal to implement a digital tax system for the global era.\nThe proposals would have lead to higher tax bills for some of the world’s most valuable companies, like Google and Facebook, but would also redefine the basic foundations of international tax for a world where economic value is derived from data rather than physical goods.\nBritain and France were most vocal about the tax proposals last year, advocating a focus on making it more difficult for large technology companies to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions, and to introduce a minimum corporate tax.\nAt the 2019 G20 Summit, France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire said, “We have a new economic model based on digital activity that is based on massive sales and exchanges and data usage. For now, there is no fair tax for this new economic model.”\nTaxation Tensions\nLast Sunday in Riyadh, Bruno Le Maire addressed reporters at the sidelines of the G20 meeting. He said, “There is a consensus to build a solution by the end of 2020. Let's be clear – either we have at the end of 2020 an international solution… clearly in the interest of all countries and digital companies, or there is no solution and … then it will be up to the national taxes to enter into force.”\nThe G20 leaders have also encouraged further work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on the global rules to tax digital giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. The OECD wants to agree on the technical details of such a tax by July.\nDespite companies like Amazon making global headlines for not paying taxes, United States Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin has expressed that he is hoping for a resolution on the digital tax by the end of 2020. He did note that Washington would strike back if France or others were to try and enforce such a tax without their consensus. He told Reuters, “We’ve been very consistent in saying we think the digital services tax is discriminatory in nature against digital companies, and specifically a handful of US companies.”\nAn agreement is expected to be reached by the year’s end that will define the global ruleset and hopefully avoid the resulting fragmentation of localized digital tax regimes.",

    "content": "It’s no secret that TRON has been eyeing a foray into NFTs and digital collectibles for some time; only last week, Justin Sun was pipped to the punch to purchase Beeple’s NFT art collection at Christie’s. The TRON founder placed a last-minute bid that fell just short of the $69 million the work eventually went for. Now, TRON is to gain a foothold in the metaverse developed by blockchain gaming world MegaCryptoPolis. The move will enable TRX to be used within Mega’s virtual universe.\nTRON Takes a Tumble Down the NFT Rabbithole\nWhile TRON sometimes attracts flak for following where other blockchains lead, it should be noted that the TRON network has long been synonymous with blockchain gaming. And where there are blockchain games there are NFTs, which allow players to trade in-game assets such as shields, swords, and land. MegaCryptoPolis emulates Decentraland, providing an all-encompassing universe where players can play out their own feudal fantasies.\nNot only can participants own virtual land, but they can charge rent on it, and can even benefit from the price appreciation of neighboring properties, which in turn will increase the value of their own holdings. TRON is fond of adding a “Sun” element to its entertainment forays, be it issuing a memecoin in honor of its founder, or in this case creating an edifice in his name.\nThe Sun Tower in the MegaCryptoPolis world recreates Justin Sun’s office, giving players an inkling into how the blockchain founder sees the world. Players who create their own avatar can visit the tower and can even purchase plots of land using TRX. And because MegaCryptoPolis offers various monetization opportunities within the game, players can actually earn TRX simply for doing what they were planning to do anyway: play.\nFirst Decentraland, Then Mega\nWhen Decentraland held its ICO back in 2017, it seemed a wildly ambitious concept for a project that could take years to build. While the project has indeed taken years to reach maturity, the concept doesn’t seem so outlandish now that NFTs are everywhere, digital has resoundly trumped physical, and anyone who’s anyone is entering the metaverse to explore what it has to offer.\nMegaCryptoPolis provides a more gamified take on Decentraland, one that is suited to casual players over hardcore developers. It’s the perfect virtual realm, in other words, for an entertainment network like TRON that is very much consumer-oriented.\nIf the incentive of owning digital land and generating revenue from charging rent isn’t sufficient, there’s also a daily disbursal of funds to all players in the game. The prize pot currently stands at $1.365 million, which is only set to grow further as more players enter the metaverse.",

    "content": "Over the past week, the comments of a counter-terrorism think tank Director have indicated that ISIS has been using cryptocurrency platforms to conceal donations and bypass financial security measures and could be hoarding close to 300 million in Bitcoin.\nThe think tank expert initially made the revelation after identifying an increase in advertising for BTC donations. However, a recent report from Chainalysis suggests that there is no evidence of ISIS's $300 million BTC war-chest and they are not impressed with the mainstream media's conflation of the Director's comments.\nThe articles reporting the supposed war-chest took their lead from the comments of Hans-Jakob Schindler, Director of the CEP (the Counter Extremism Project, a specialist think tank tracking the trend of terrorism financing), who revealed that since 2017, the authorities have been searching for the terror group’s mission war chest and it is feared that it may have been converted into cryptocurrency to be used at a later date.\nSchindler said, “I’m wondering if from 2017-2020 there has been $300M that we have not found and that’s why I’m thinking this might have been one of the ways it might have been used.”\nThe thought of a notorious extremist group like ISIS being funded by anonymous crypto and Bitcoin fits right into many people’s conceptions of the main use for digital assets: to fund terror and buy contraband.\nHowever, as Chainalysis has revealed in a recent report, there just is no evidence beyond Schindler’s guesstimation and there is no evidence among his think tanks research either to make the $300 million BTC war chest claim. In fact, there is nothing really to suggest that ISIS has any bitcoin at all.\nChainalysis Busts ISIS BTC War-Chest Myth\nAs mainstream media headlines blew up with the sensation ISIS crypto-fund story, Chainalysis decided to publish a fact-checking blog on May 20, accusing the media of sensationalizing out of context comments.\nThe report reads, “This week, stories circulated that Hans-Jakob Schindler, director of the think tank the Counter Extremism Project, said that authorities have searched for ISIS’s missing war chest since 2017 and that he is wondering if the $300 million has not been found because cryptocurrency “might have been one of the ways it might have been used… This would be an ideal storage mechanism until it is needed. If done right, it would be unfindable and unseizable for most governments.”\nAccording to the analysis firm, most of the terror financing ever conducted via bitcoin has never even raised more than $10,000.\nChainalysis asserts, “Schindler’s theory is highly unlikely,” further explaining that if ISIS had funneled oil proceeds into Bitcoin, “trading volume of regional exchanges and money service businesses would have reflected this flow of funds.”\nFurthermore, contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are not necessarily the ideal storage mechanisms for illicit funds. While digital assets have a reputation for being untraceable, in comparison to cash they are “inherently transparent”, every transaction is recorded and publicly visible in the decentralized ledger.",

    "summary": "Over the past few days, a central debate has been ongoing on crypto Twitter, fueled by Bitcoin and Ethereum advocates. Both Bitcoiners and Ethereans disagree on which cryptocurrency is better for use.",
    "content": "Over the past few days, a debate has been ongoing on crypto Twitter, fueled by Bitcoin and Ethereum advocates. Both Bitcoiners and Ethereans disagree on which cryptocurrency is superior as a digital asset.\nBitcoin and Ethereum Debate\nWhile Bitcoiners insist that it is impossible to calculate Ethereum's total crypto supply, Ethereum dismisses this statement and say that it is actually a relatively easy task.\nThe question of how Ethereum’s native coin Ether (ETH) could be independently verified by miners was brought up a lot. Ethereum, unlike other cryptos and unlike its counter rival Bitcoin, does not have a limited supply on ETH. Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, caps at a maximum of 21 BTC. Also, while Bitcoin operates on a system that enables it to easily track its maximum supply, Ethereum does not, as both BTC and ETH operate on separate blockchain protocols.\nWhen debating over the worth of the crypto assets, Bitcoin bulls are quick to point out that Ethereum lacks a crucial feature, that of figuring out easily what amount ETH sits at. Taking to his Twitter, Bitcoin bull and co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano said: “The Ethereum community can’t figure out what the total outstanding supply of the asset is. This is a MAJOR problem and showcases why ETH is not good money.”\nEthereum Blockchain Operates Differently\nFighting back, Ethereans were quick to point out that the underlying problem was that both Bitcoin and Ether cryptocurrencies operated on fundamentally different blockchains, making the comparison invalid. On Ethereum, there appears to be a way to calculate the max supply of ETH coins, but a bit of coding might be required in order to do so. As for BTC, it is a known fact in the crypto community that the digital asset caps at 21 million BTC.\nIn response to the online crypto debate, a challenge was put up on Twitter, calling Ethereum developers to run a script against their own ETH node within a 12-hour period. In response to the challenge, systems engineers Marc-Andre Dumas overcame it and briefly explained that the amount of ETH that was calculated was based on the current existing amount of Ether on the market. This is a method used by CoinMarketCap analysts to track tokens.\nUnlike Bitcoin, what differs in Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem is that in order to calculate ETH supply, block rewards as well as “uncle rewards” need to be taken into consideration. With block rewards, there are two types – genesis and mining recompensations. As for uncle rewards, they are allocated to blocks that don’t quite make it into the blockchain but are almost there. They exist mainly to improve decentralization.\nBitcoin Advocate Defends Ethereum\nThe criticism of Ethereum and Bitcoin has been running viral on Twitter’s social platform recently. To address Bitcoiners’ fuss over Ethereum’s total supply, Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopolous took to his Twitter platform and called out Bitcoiners’ seemingly ignorance on the matter of ETH supply calculation. Though an avid blockchain and Bitcoin enthusiast himself, the crypto influencer addressed the crypto Twitter community at the beginning of a long thread, calling out known Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff:",

    "content": "SINGAPORE - On 18th May 2020, Matrixport will introduce the Fixed Income Investment Product and the Flexi-Term Investment product, where asset security is protected by a risk control mechanism by real crypto assets guaranteed by excess pledge.\nMatrixport is launching two new additions to their assortment of cryptocurrency asset management products and services, the Fixed Income Investment product and the Flexi-Term Investment product. For both products, real crypto assets are guaranteed by excess pledge and the product itself is designed to have ensured asset security by institutional-grade custody and a rigorous risk control mechanism, while offering its users high returns with stability and liquidity.\nThe Fixed Income Investment product is a digital assets-based wealth management product derived through creditor’s rights assignment. USD stablecoin holders who use this product can benefit from a 7 to 8% fixed annualized return. In addition, users have the ability to either hold their investment until it reaches its maturity or opt to assign the loan assets to other creditors at a subsequently lower price before the loans date of expiry. This means that investments can be cashed ahead of schedule in the presence of other potential creditors.\nThe Flexi-Term Investment Product, on the other hand, aims to serve as an alternative to a fiat saving account in a low to negative interest environment. It allows for more flexibility in their high-yield low-risk category with an early exit option. Compared to dollar deposits, early redemption still offers a higher interest rate. With this product, users can hold until the product reaches its maturity and receive the fixed income, or in this instance users have the option to choose early redemption and recover the principal and potentially part of the income.\nBoth products feature a risk control mechanism for asset losses incurred by falling prices or borrowers insolvency. Other than this, these products are built on the premise of full transparency by offering a pay-off calculation that is visible to investors, which allows them to receive their returns in either the currency they used for the contract or a stablecoin such as USDC. This is all backed by Institutional level custody services that guarantee asset protection and safety throughout the process.\nFor more information, please visit the official website: https://www.matrixport.com/\nAbout Matrixport\nFounded in February 2019, Matrixport is the gateway to the digital economy where you can trade, custody, invest and borrow crypto assets all in one stop. With rich industry resources and leading technology capabilities, Matrixport aims to create the next generation digital financial service platform. Our vision is to enable a more open and equal financial system using blockchain technologies.\nWebsite|Telegram|Medium|Twitter",

Instead, it is also a burden as it requires a level of transparency and maturity to meet the charter’s requirements.\nThe company said several Asian clients have selected Anchorage because of its strong regulatory status in the US.\n\"We appreciate Anchorage’s attention to regulatory compliance and vetting of the digital assets they support,\" said Will Chiu, Antalpha's chief investment officer, in a statement.\n\"Through their combination of crypto-native fluency and understanding of traditional finance needs, they continue to support us in expanding the adoption of digital assets,\" he added.\nThe company's business model involves providing institutions with integrated financial services and infrastructure solutions. They could include solutions such as custody, staking and trading services.\nRecently, the startup successfully raised $350 million in a Series D funding round led by investment firm KKR. Other participants included traditional players such as Goldman Sachs and Thoma Bravo, along with crypto-native firms such as Alameda Research and Blockchain Capital.\n\"We work with institutions and what we see is that institutions have very long-term horizons; they are not stopping these partnerships,\" Mónica said.\nIn another major development, Anchorage will become the preferred custodian for buzzy new layer one blockchain Aptos.\nIn a recent interview with CoinDesk, Mónica said, \"by partnering with Aptos, we are actually helping make sure that the next generation of layer 1 blockchains are taking these proper [security] considerations, and that will only spur future growth in the industry.\"",

Although privacy is obviously a necessity for criminals, law-abiding citizens need privacy as well to protect themselves from such criminals who are constantly on the hunt for a vulnerable target.\nBitcoin Mixer offers a solution to the many risks posed by transacting bitcoins online by offering a service that exchanges your BTC with others’ BTC, a process known as “bitcoin shuffling,” to protect individuals’ anonymity and privacy.\nThere are a variety of coin mixers out there (not just for Bitcoin) that follow the same principle, but with their own unique mixing algorithms and models.\nWhy Use Bitcoin Mixer?\nIt is a common misconception that Bitcoin is completely anonymous and untraceable. In fact, Bitcoin is a completely transparent network. Because transactions are broadcast publicly on the digital ledger known as the blockchain, a clever criminal or law enforcement officer can perform a “blockchain analysis” to gather key data about the bitcoin address and the person behind the online wallet, such as how much bitcoin they own, how they spend their money, and other personal information such as name and contact details.\nFor instance, if an individual purchases from a third party with BTC, like a crypto exchange or a retailer that requires identity verification, then personal information about the identity behind the bitcoin address pseudonym can be leaked, stolen, or sold to those who request it, be it law enforcement officers or nifty thieves. Anyone’s Bitcoin address could theoretically attract unwanted attention, whether it is due to a person’s wealth, the suspicion of illegal activity, or is simply a random target.\nOnce your personal identity is linked to the wallet, you can be scammed or hacked to access your private key, which is your most important password that executes any transaction on the network.\nBitcoin, when used properly, is secure and difficult to trace, so it has attracted people who value privacy. However, it is important to know that individuals’ pseudonyms, or the string of letters and numbers that is their bitcoin wallet address, can be linked to one’s real identity via careful monitoring and analysis.\nFor example, in the well-known case of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbrich, his Bitcoin transaction activity was traced to a number of pseudonyms, which eventually led to his real identity after an FBI agent combed through archives of digital forums and found an incriminating post.\nTo maintain privacy and eliminate the possibility that your transaction history and activity can be monitored, the easiest solution is to simply shuffle or mix your bitcoins with others’ coins using a coin mixer. This way, your coins (which possess transaction history data), won’t reveal a clear forensic trail.\nHow Does Bitcoin Mixer Work?\nBitcoin Mixer works by sending you fresh BTC, Ethereum, or LTC, for the amount you send in, in order to randomize your funds and obscure the source of bitcoins you spend from hackers or third parties. The process is completely automated and does not store any personal information to ensure security and trust. All you have to do is provide the address you wish to send fresh coins to and send in the amount that you wish to mix. It is recommended to mix your coins every so often, or after using any exchange, buying new bitcoins, or purchasing from a merchant that requires identity verification. The service charge is a randomized 2-5% fee for every transaction.\nThere have been a number of mixing strategies out there, ranging from completely centralized solutions like Bitcoin Mixer where users rely on trust, to decentralized solutions where each user puts their amount into a pot and receives the same amount back but with fresh coins.\nIn Summary\nWhen it comes to financial transactions, anonymity and autonomy are paramount. Using cryptocurrencies offers a lot of advantages, but still pose some classical risks. In a decentralized, transparent environment, bad actors could identify your wallet address by tracking your coins on the blockchain transaction history, which can lead to private information getting into the wrong hands, and can ultimately lead hackers to try to identify who you are.\nCoin mixers like Bitcoin Mixer are simple and effective solutions to minimize such risk and should be used by anyone who values their privacy and security.",

    "summary": "China has taken a new step with an important legal precedent regarding Bitcoin in a property dispute case in Hangzhou. Read more about how this case affirmed the legal status of Bitcoin as a virtual property with protection under Chinese law.",
    "content": "A property dispute involving Bitcoin was held in the internet court in Hangzhou, China on July 18, setting a new precedent by declaring that Bitcoin is virtual property with monetary value.\nAccording to the case of plaintiff Wu against defendants FXBTC and Taobao, it has been recognized that Bitcoin has the attributes of virtual property and therefore should be protected according to Chinese laws and regulations.\nFor the first time, Bitcoin has been recognized as valuable, scarce and disposable which are attributes of property with protection under Chinese law, according to Pang Lipeng – one of the attorneys on the case. The court’s ruling concludes that owning cryptocurrencies in China is still legal and should be protected according to the corresponding property rights.\nHowever, this is not the first case where cryptocurrencies have been deemed legal by the Chinese judicial body. In a previous case, the Shenzhen Arbitration Commission mentioned that cryptocurrency assets should be protected in accordance with Chinese regulations on property ownership in October 2018.\n“This is a clear signal that the financial authorities are starting to loosen control over digital currency and virtual currency,” Cao Yin, one of the earliest advocators of blockchain technology in China, told the Global Times on July 18. However, they also officially mentioned that at the People’s Bank of China says that “Indeed, Bitcoin is virtual property, but it’s not fiat money.”\nWu's case\nIn 2013, plaintiff Wu purchased 2.657 Bitcoins which was worth around RMB 20,000 at the time from the website “FXBTC” which was operated through a Shanghai technology company through Taobao.\nThe purchased Bitcoins were stored on a virtual wallet on the FXBTC website. When Wu wanted to access his Bitcoins in 2017, he found that the FXBTC website was shut down and therefore could not gain access to his funds.\nWu claimed that he was not notified of the website’s closure and could not withdraw his funds before the website shut down. Wu was not able to contact the website’s operator and demanded the defendants to pay RMB 76,314, which is the transaction price of 2.675 Bitcoins at the time of prosecution in compensation for his economic losses.\nThe court rejected Wu’s claims against FXBTC’s operator and Taobao due to the lack of evidence and the entire lawsuit was rejected. However, the court affirmed the legal status of Bitcoin as a virtual property in this case as a legal commodity but not a currency.",

    "content": "Binance crypto exchange partnered with blockchain-based internet browser Brave to enable crypto adoption into browsers. Such a partnership aims to let Brave browser users enjoy convenient and seamless cryptocurrency trading through Binance.\nBrave is an open-source web browser open-source based on Chromium. It blocks malware and website trackers and uses blockchain to anonymously keep track of user activities. The company has been paying around with cryptos for a while. The firm has its own crypto asset, the Basic Attention Token (BAT).\nEfforts to let users access crypto\nBrave has integrated the Binance widget in its new tab page to give its users direct access to Binance.US for US-based users and Binance.com sites. Users will use the widget to receive, buy and trade crypto assets, get deposit addresses, and view their balance directly on the new tab page. This aims to enable users to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, and several other cryptos supported by Binance.\nUsers would not need to worry about the safety of their assets since the widget is not merely a loaded iframe. Instead, it is a native widget Binance’s API built into the Brave browser and does not load any data from Binance’s server, implying that users’ privacy is protected.\nBrendan Eich, Co-founder and CEO of Brave revealed that crypto trading can be a daunting task for users who are not familiar with such digital assets. He said that the move to integrate Binance into the Brave browser is set to make the process simple and seamless. He stated that by bringing a leading crypto exchange like Binance directly into the browser, Brave is taking crypto trading mainstream and enabling users to carry out transactions with ease.\nBinance believes that such integration will enable traders to manage their cryptocurrencies in a more frictionless and safer way. Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao said, “The Binance widget on Brave’s privacy-oriented browser instills a safer way to buy and sell crypto and also reduces user friction to onboard, trade, and interact with the Binance ecosystem. We are looking forward to our long-term partnership with Brave to make it even easier to interact with crypto and encourage more utility in the near future.”\nBinance widget will be enabled by default, though users can choose to turn it off and hide it directly from the new tab page or by managing their settings if they want.\nBinance’s commitment to build a super exchange ecosystem and add options\nIn December 2019, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao made new announcements concerning the company’s new partnerships and new products that would be rolling out. The company has been committed to adding lots of new functions like airdrops and staking and the support for forks. Changpeng revealed that of late, the crypto exchange has plans to support payments and other features.\nThe company’s intent to develop super exchange ecosystem is aimed to enable users to have access to varieties of value-added services on mobile applications. Such a move is an appropriate one as the company wants to meet the latest consumers’ needs. The current world is in the mobile internet stage, whereby the majority of people use mobile apps to access information and products. It is clear that Binance’s move to partner with Brave is based on its effort to increase the liquidity and access of cryptocurrencies globally.",

The issue is particularly important in cryptocurrency, where spam accounts impersonate famous personalities like Musk in order to promote scams involving fake crypto giveaways.\nAccording to Bloomberg, some crypto enthusiasts believe that Musk may advocate for the use of blockchain to help reduce bots on Twitter and authenticate all real humans on social media.\nFreedom of speech is a priority for Musk, and he intends to lift the company’s lifelong bans on users. Those values align with those of most crypto believers dedicated to the ethos of the decentralization promoted by blockchain.\nAs per Bloomberg, Musk could potentially implement a token-based voting system that allows users to have more say over what occurs on Twitter. He also could add more crypto elements on Twitter to expand decentralization aspects and mainstream usage of digital assets.\nMusk has already expressed ambitions of turning Twitter into a “super app.” In the past, he expressed admiration for China’s WeChat platform, which can handle things like messaging, games, payments, and video streaming.",

    "content": "In October 2018, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) announced a wide array of new initiatives, enhanced programs and support services aimed at strengthening and accelerating the growth of Hong Kong’s Innovation and Technology (I&T) sector and startups.\nTo support its key strategy of grooming promising technology startups—HKSTP operates effective startup incubation programs to turn innovative ideas into marketable products and solutions.\nBlockchain.News sat down with Peter Mok, Head of Incubation and Acceleration Programmes, HKSTP to gain further insight into the Incubation initiative and the custom-made programs, that have been designed to support technology startups, and specifically how they could be utilized by blockchain startups.\nFirst “STEP”\nHKSTP currently has three stages of support programs for technology startups. Mok said, “The goal is to support startups beginning from their conception stage all the way to their IPO. It is not necessary for the participants to even have a minimum viable product (MVP) during the application stage; we will start our support from the idea. At each of the three stages of incubation, a financial subsidy is included for the startup.”\nThe first stage is a year-long program aptly named Science and Technology Entrepreneur Programme (STEP). Mok explained, “STEP is ultimately an idea generation which helps potential startups or even a single founder validate their business plan and theoretically confront the issues that could potentially arise in the market through assimilation training. The participants will also be advised on the government assistance schemes for which they may be eligible. Once this stage is complete, not only will the startup teams know if their idea is viable, but they will also learn what is required of them to do business in this sector. Those that qualify for incubation will enjoy a full range of tailor-made support services and facilities that will help drive their business to the next level of development.”\nCore incubation\nOnce the STEP program is completed, the participants can move to one of the three core incubation programs. Mok said, “The core programs focus more on the MVP—prototyping, commercialization, R&D and the initial market offering.” To qualify for the programs, applicants must be a Hong Kong-registered technology startup company limited by shares and established within no more than 2 years on or before the date of the application. Mok expounded, “The admissions criteria are quite broad, but we really evaluate our applicants based on four major but basic elements – the team combination; the business plan; the level of innovation and of course whether we believe the endeavor has a chance for success.”\nMok highlighted HKSTP’s understanding of the hard work and determination it takes to create the perfect product, application or device especially for those that plan to innovate and change the world we live in. He reiterated, “We aim to provide support every step of the way to help technology startups turn their vision into reality.”\nWhen technology startups are ready to take on the world stage, HKSTP offers the Leading Enterprises Acceleration Programme (LEAP) catering to their needs for global business expansion. The LEAP is designed for startups with viable market products and scalable business model. Mok said, “Upon admission, LEAP acceleratees will enjoy a wide range of world-class support and subsidies, including the support to expand their business into the Greater Bay Area (GBA) market, a cluster of 11 cities with a combined population of 65 million and GDP of USD $1.36 trillion (compared to USD $0.76 trillion for San Francisco Bay). In addition, startups can access funding up to HK$ 4.7 million for subsidies and support from fundraising, business development, and professional services.”\nSmart Region for a Smart City\nThe government of HKSAR published the Smart City Blueprint in December 2017, mapping out a development plan designed to embrace innovation and technology, enhance the effectiveness of city management and improve people’s quality of life.\nIn response, Hong Kong Science Park, a designated smart region living lab in the blueprint, create the ideal testbed for pushing forward the Smart City vision, leveraging the city’s attributes of dense population, efficiency, world-class ICT infrastructure, and high internet connectivity. Mok explained, “Hong Kong is a very highly developed city with a very dense population who are used to convenience. It's very difficult, to deploy and test any new technological infrastructure without causing major delays and disruption for the people.”\nHKSTP is often described as a ‘living laboratory’ that supports and pilots innovative solutions and fosters the adoption of new technologies. As well as providing a platform and support for innovative university research, those in the Smart Region are exposed to HKSTP’s other partners which include some of Hong Kong’s leading corporations as well as other major global entities. Mok highlighted, “We have partnered with over 63 leading corporations from Hong Kong, and globally, which allows our incubation participants and researchers under the startup scheme to meet with corporate leaders—these include organizations such as the Hong Kong Airport Authority, Cathay Pacific and TLC—fostering a collaborative platform for the technological ecosystem and the business sector as well as the sharing of ideas and the co-creation of data applications to deliver socio-economic benefits.”\nThe accelerating roadmap\nIn the future, the HKSTP will continue to strengthen its smart innovation and startup support with the introduction of various acceleration programs and corporate matching initiatives.\n“In the past, we were mainly focusing on helping startups in Hong Kong and linking them to corporate industry and we will continue to do so,” said Mok. “But we are also running a lot of new acceleration programs such as the IDM2 Hardware Accelerator— it is a hardware solutions program which IDM2 stands for Ideas to Design for Manufacturing and Marketing. This complements our various incubation programs as 51% of these companies come with their own hardware, so hardware acceleration is a logical next step.”\nAnother new initiative, the Global Acceleration Academy (GAA) aims to connect high-potential startups with world-class industry leaders and bring their innovations to the real-world marketplace. “The GAA program actually serves as a bridge for the market demands and technology at a very early stage. We go inside the corporations with access to their data. They can express their challenges and customer requirements directly to our start-ups who can create tailor-made solutions.” said Mok. “It’s actually a type of early customer engagement, we are not waiting for customers to tell us what to build, we are innovating ahead of the demand.”\nThe overarching goal of HKSTP is to become the technological launching pad for all of the Asia Pacific. Mok concluded, “We want the best talent from Asia. Leveraging the traditional gateway position of Hong Kong, our focus will be more on deep technology. We have a world-class research foundation for technology research, especially in the realm of biotech momentum technologies. The strides we have already made will distinguish us from most, if not all of the Asian cities, and draw in the best of best researchers globally.”\nPart 2 of the interview is coming up, stay tuned!",

The announcement comes following a recent PwC report that predicts blockchain has the potential to boost global gross domestic product (GDP) by $1.76 trillion.\nAccording to an email shared with Blockchain.News, the four new offerings will leverage Block.one’s performance-focused EOSIO software and will include Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), consulting, technical support, and training and certification programs.\nPwC Predicts Huge Growth For Blockchain\nWhile blockchain is most known as the underlying infrastructure supporting cryptocurrencies, PwC experts reviewed other key advantages of the distributed ledger technology (DLT).\nFive case scenarios in which blockchain could be used to drive the digital revolution forward included provenance – the tracking and tracing of products and services – payments and financial services, identity management, and the application of blockchain in contracts and dispute resolution as well as customer engagement.\nSpeaking about the potential ways blockchain technology could be used, Steve Davies, a Partner and Blockchain Leader at PwC UK, said:\nThe analysis evaluated blockchain technology’s potential across different industries, from healthcare, government and public services to finance, logistics, retail, and more.\nAccording to PwC analysts, Asia stands to reap the most economic benefits from blockchain technology over other continents.\nIn terms of countries, China and the US were designated as the ones that could potentially gain the highest net benefits from blockchain, estimated at $440 billion and $407 billion respectively, according to data from PwC. The net benefits of five countries, notably Germany, Japan, the UK, France, and India were also calculated to surpass $50 billion.\nOverall, across all sectors, the public administration, healthcare, and education industry appears to be the biggest beneficiaries, with PwC expecting them to gain approximately $574 billion by 2030 through using blockchain for identity and credentials.\nBlockchain Enterprise Entrance\nAs enterprise digital transformation continues to drive corporate growth, organizations are exploring blockchain-based solutions for more reliable, secure and transparent data infrastructure.\nThe accelerated interest and adoption of the technology has left a growing gap in both technical expertise and resources needed to effectively incorporate blockchain solutions. Block.one’s EOSIO for Business is focused on closing this gap with simple yet powerful solutions.\nBlock.one Chief Operating Officer Ted Cahall:\nThe four major components of EOSIO for Business include:\nClients are already benefiting from Block.one’s enterprise support.

    "summary": "In December 2023, a significant increase in crypto thefts was triggered by an $81.5 million attack on Orbit Bridge, marking one of the largest attacks on cross-chain bridges in recent years.",
    "content": "Among the history of cryptocurrency thefts, December 2023 stands out as a particularly noteworthy month. This is mostly attributable to a huge exploit that occurred on the Orbit Bridge. On January 1, the blockchain security company PeckShield said that the $81.5 million vulnerability on Orbit Bridge marked December the fifth-largest month for hacks in the year. This month was the fifth highest month for hacks overall.\nOn the evening of New Year's Eve, a significant assault was launched against the Orbit Bridge, which is an essential component of the Orbit Chain ecosystem. This illegal breach resulted in the loss of the equivalent of $81.5 million worth of cryptocurrency, making it the ninth-largest assault on cross-chain bridges that has occurred over the course of the previous three years. The Orbit Chain team took quick action by demanding that bitcoin exchanges throughout the world freeze the money that had been stolen. Additionally, they worked along with law enforcement authorities to hunt down and secure the assets.\nThe assault on Orbit Bridge was a substantial contributor to the overall losses that occurred in the cryptocurrency landscape during the month of December, which amounted to approximately one hundred million dollars. There was a bigger tendency that was detected in 2023, which was that the overall losses that were caused by crypto hacks, frauds, and exploits fluctuated between $1.51 billion and $2 billion. This occurrence is a part of that larger trend. In particular, the months of September and November were extremely disastrous, with losses totaling more than 700 million dollars over the course of those two months.\nThroughout the year 2023, the cryptocurrency industry was subjected to a number of high-profile attacks. Among them were the Mixin Network, which suffered a loss of $200 million in September, and substantial exploits on Poloniex and HTX/Heco Bridge in November, which resulted in losses of $131.4 million and $113.3 million, respectively. The Euler Finance attack, which resulted in a loss of $197 million in March, and the Multichain breach, which resulted in a loss of $125 million in July, were two more noteworthy events.\nIn 2023, blockchain security company Beosin saw a considerable decrease in the number of hacks, phishing scams, and rug pulls in comparison to the previous year. This was the case despite the high-profile occurrences that occurred in 2023. In 2023, the total losses were around $1.4 billion, which is a decline of approximately 61.2% from the previous year's total of approximately $4.38 billion. This drop offers evidence that the environment of blockchain security is improving, as well as the efficacy of remedies that have been implemented by the cryptocurrency community.",

    "content": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been more than 9 million COVID-19 cases around the world and over 473,000 deaths as of press time. In light of the recent global crisis, the most important and highly anticipated medical milestone in the world today is the discovery of the COVID-19 vaccine.\nCOVID-19 testing remains one of the most stressed medical lab procedures today; pressurized with an unanticipated virus that threw our world into a pandemic. Some businesses are looking at integrating emerging technologies such as blockchain to fight the coronavirus.\nMagic of the modern ages: Kadena\nKadena LLC, JPMorgan's blockchain spin-off, provides an independent blockchain network, that could be used to run coronavirus tests. Kadena was the first blockchain company to come out of JP Morgan's Blockchain Center for Excellence and announced the full launch of its public blockchain in January 2020.\nThe company’s distributed app (Dapp) will be used to confirm the authenticity of coronavirus tests by using QR codes to track the kits from the manufacturer to the healthcare provider. The medical personnel can then use the QR code, the test kit information, and the patient's test results to create a patient’s record. This record can be stored on Kadena’s blockchain which can be accessed anywhere.\nIn addition to ensuring data integrity, the Kadena App will also help researchers, academics, and government officials to understand the demographics of the spread of the disease. The Dapp is already available on Kadena's testnet, and users with no prior knowledge of blockchain technology can use the app, developers who want to access the data stored on it can do so as well without using Kadena's tokens or wallet.\nTowards a COVID-19 free world\nWith the alarming rate of new cases, technological advancements have been emerging to help governments to detect new and record new cases. Chinese President Xi Jinping previously suggested that the fight against the new virus has highlighted the need for a better governance mechanism, suggesting blockchain technology should be integrated into the existing system to gain better insights into social circumstances.\nThe Public Health Blockchain Consortium (PHBC) has announced the launch of a monitoring blockchain aimed to verify communities and workplaces that are free from the coronavirus COVID-19, as well as other high-risk viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The Consortium consists of health authorities, universities, healthcare providers, and innovators who aim to collect and store anonymous health data on the blockchain, to improve the lives of people in the world. The blockchain monitor would help identify safe zones where there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus.",

    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy. This preemptive measure is designed to protect user funds in the event that quantum computers become capable of breaking current cryptographic defenses.\nThe proposal, outlined in a discussion on the Ethereum Research forum, highlights the urgency of preparing for quantum computers' ability to solve problems like the discrete logarithm, which underpins the security of many current cryptographic algorithms including those used by Ethereum.\nThe proposed hard fork would entail the following steps:\nThe conversation in the Ethereum community is informed by a range of expert inputs. One participant shared a visual aid to help understand the proof statement, while others discussed existing quantum-secure fallbacks for wallets and the integration of preimages into ECDSA signature nonces to create fail-stop signature schemes.\nSome community members have cautioned that if quantum computers capable of cracking Ethereum wallets are already in malicious hands, it might be too late to differentiate between legitimate owners and attackers. They suggest that instead of relying on stateful post-quantum algorithms, Ethereum should use NIST standardized ones in hybrid mode with a classical algorithm, like combining Dilithium with ed25519. This would, however, increase block sizes due to the large signature and public key sizes of current post-quantum schemes.\nOthers have proposed the development of machine learning systems to monitor and detect abnormal transactions as an early warning system to trigger a fail-safe fork.\nThe community's response underlines the importance of staying ahead in the security arms race against quantum computing. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets are already in development, as is the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic measures in other digital signature applications.\nThis initiative by the Ethereum community reflects the broader blockchain ecosystem's commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of emerging technological threats. As quantum computing advances, the blockchain sector's proactive stance on security promises to be a critical factor in its long-term viability and trustworthiness.\nThe Ethereum team and community's proactive approach to quantum security demonstrates a clear recognition of the challenges ahead and a willingness to address them head-on. This ongoing conversation will likely shape the future of Ethereum's infrastructure and set a precedent for other blockchain platforms.",

One of the most prominent of these in recent times is the backing of CertiK when the smart contract security startup pulled $88 million in funding as the firm attained a $2 billion valuation.\nThe bank is a prominent force in today’s blockchain world and the firm’s analysts are known to always wade into key conversions that define the entire landscape. Despite being a legacy bank, Goldman Sachs believes Bitcoin and Gold can co-exist - a marked difference from traditional finance stakeholders who have chosen not to recognize the ingenuity of blockchain technology.",

Any cryptocurrency exchange needs to be registered and approved by SEC. Although the decentralized trading platform has the characteristics of decentralization, it still needs to be bound by laws and regulations.\nHe said that:\nAs Gensler’s support for cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose further. According to Coinmarketcap, bitcoin rose by 3.61% in the past 24 hours, reaching a maximum of $51,847 today. At the press time, bitcoin was trading at $51,409.35.\nLast month, the Chinese government escalated its suppression of cryptocurrency again, strictly banning all types of cryptocurrency-related activities, and stated that all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal. Foreign cryptocurrency exchanges are also prohibited from opening accounts in China.",

    "summary": "A number of significant events has led to XRP rebounding higher at the end of April. However, it may be difficult for XRP to maintain this momentum due to the weakening of the crypto market.",
    "content": "Although Ripple is still battling with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reach a conclusion on the outcome of XRP in the United States, the recent price action of XRP has been bullish. The surge in XRP's price can be allocated to several events that has served to positively influence XRP's price.\nPhemex crypto exchange announced that it will relist XRP on its trading platform, as the cryptocurrency is in “great demand” on April 28. On the following day, Yoshitaka Kitao, the CEO of SBI Group, revealed that an initial public offering may be in Ripple's future plans.\nHowever, due to the overall downturn in the cryptocurrency market, it may be difficult for XRP to maintain the above-mentioned upward momentum.\nAccording to Coinmarketcap, Ripple is ranked as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $67 billion.\nRipple (XRP) Price Analysis\nJudging from the daily candlestick chart, yesterday, a bearish Doji pattern was formed on the chart, which implies that Ripple may soon reverse. Today, as Bitcoin has dropped 3.89% from its stable $58K level to the $55,795 level within 24 hours, the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen to varying degrees. Ripple (XRP) is no exception.\nXRP dropped by 7.55% in 24 hours. At the time of writing, Ripple is trading at $1.46.\nFrom the perspective of transaction volume, compared with the previous transaction volume, there are obvious signs of shrinking. It seems unlikely that there will be large fluctuations in the next trading day. This implies that bullish investors are still hesitant to buy in large quantities, but choose better timing and lower prices to buy on dips.\nCurrently, the price of Ripple is still running above the Exponential Moving Average ribbon. However, the Relative Strength Index indicator, which is developing downward and gradually approaching the equilibrium point of the bulls and bears sides, will continue to weaken on time.\nThe bear side will push the price down to the 20 day-Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which may put the defensive line to the test in the next trading.\nThe blue K line of the MACD indicator is glued down with the yellow Signal line. This indicates that the bullish momentum is weakening.\nIf the bulls can actively defend the 20-EMA of $1.38 support, then Ripple (XRP) is still in an uptrend. A break below the 20-EMA of $1.38 may indicate the beginning of a deeper correction to the 50-EMA of $1.12.",

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and partnerships in the coming weeks.",
    "content": "Michael Kong, CEO of Fantom Foundation, has revealed the exciting launch plans and future development of Sonic, a revolutionary blockchain technology. Kong highlighted the significant advancements made since the debut of the Opera network in 2019, which laid the groundwork for Sonic's creation.\nThe Opera network, based on concepts studied by Andre Cronje, offered improved scalability and time to finality compared to Ethereum at the time. However, as the network gained popularity, it faced challenges during times of high demand, leading to congestion and a deteriorating user experience.\nTo address these issues, the Fantom team has been diligently working on Sonic for the past two years, aiming to create the most scalable and secure blockchain technology to date. Sonic boasts an impressive capacity to process 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality, a significant improvement over Opera's 200 TPS.\nWith Sonic's technical capabilities, Fantom plans to further innovate and evolve. The team intends to use Sonic to develop a shared sequencer for both L1 and L2 chains, enabling the processing of over 180 million daily transactions with real-time, sub-second confirmation times. This development will serve as the foundation for relaunching Fantom as a community-centric brand.\nTo support the growth and adoption of Sonic, Fantom plans to propose a governance proposal that includes several key initiatives. These initiatives include the establishment of a safe and trust-minimized bridge with native Ethereum access, simplification of staking with a fixed 14-day unbonding period, and the expansion of the Sonic Labs grant program to incentivize developers to build unique and valuable applications.\nAdditionally, Fantom aims to launch an extensive rewards campaign to thank existing users on the Opera network and promote adoption on the new chain. The introduction of supersets, an upgrade scheduled for the end of 2024, will further enhance the performance of the Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM) and increase overall efficiency. The team also plans to explore parallelization to boost Sonic's performance and continue research on off-chain execution with on-chain verification.\nFurthermore, Fantom recognizes the importance of a canonical stablecoin for the success of decentralized finance (DeFi) on both the Opera network and the new Sonic stack. Efforts are underway to implement a canonical stablecoin in the near future.\nMichael Kong expressed his excitement about the upcoming developments and partnerships. He assured the community that Fantom remains committed to the evolution of the platform, with the support of token holders, stakers, and projects on Fantom.",

Working with Flutterwave will help bridge the fiat-to-crypto gap, and we hope to stimulate more financial inclusion as Africa demonstrates strong potential in leading crypto adoption.”\nCEO of Flutterwave Olugbenga Agboola also reiterated the mission of the company saying that: “What we do at Flutterwave is, create possibilities for the everyday African to become prosperous. (….) that is what this partnership is about.\"",

Genesis Global Capital (DCG) has temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations in the wake of the FTX collapse. DCG's announcement is the latest entanglement to FTX's liquidity crisis and subsequent filing for bankruptcy protection last week.",
    "content": "Most major cryptocurrencies spent most of the day trading in the negative on cryptocurrency platforms.\nBitcoin investors have resumed their defensive attitude from the previous week, as seen by the fact that recent trading activity has been quiet at around $16,700. This is a decrease of 1.4% over the past twenty-four hours. The most recent price of ether on the market was about $1,200, representing a 3.7% decline. The value of two other prominent cryptocurrencies, CEL and UNI, dropped by more than 5% within the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the FTT token of FTX had dropped by almost 4% and was trading at $1.66. This is a significant decrease from its near-$36 high earlier in the year.\nDuring a conference call with customers, the interim CEO of Genesis, Derar Islim, shared that the firm is investigating several options for the lending division, one of which is identifying a source of fresh funding. He said Genesis would provide customers more information about the strategy the following week. Genesis Global Capital serviced an institutional clientele and had a total of $2.8 billion in active loans as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, as stated on the company's website. Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), the same company that is the parent company of CoinDesk. \"Genesis Global Capital, the lending section of Genesis, made the difficult decision today to temporarily halt redemptions and the origination of new loans. This decision was made in response to the significant market disruption caused by the FTX collapse and the loss of faith in the industry \"Amanda Cowie, the vice president of communications and marketing for DCG, made this statement.\nThe stock markets have persisted in ignoring crypto's ongoing issues. While the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) both had declines of less than one percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq experienced a surge of more than one percentage point.\nThe statement made by Genesis is the most recent issue connected to FTX's financial situation, which led to the company applying for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the previous week. This year, the industry has already been hit by several catastrophes, the most notable of which is the failure of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the LUNA token that served as collateral for it.\nGene Hoffman, president and chief operating officer of the energy-efficient blockchain Chia Network, said in an email to CoinDesk that the issue that Genesis Global Capital is going through is \"the type of problem that blockchains are built to handle.\"\nAccording to Hoffman, \"The assumptions and behaviors applied to the growing technology by Wall Street are what continue to erupt and will continue to explode.\" \"Although cryptocurrency contributes nothing to the process of obtaining a loan, we have seen players in the business overextend themselves and raise their debt using assets whose value is uncertain in the absence of supervision.\nHe emphasized how important it is for the industry to move past frauds using \"crypto bros\" and pyramid schemes. It is important to proceed with extreme care when dealing with cryptocurrencies and blockchains since they are not an \"asset class\" but rather a collection of competing technologies.\"",

    "summary": "People began hearing the word blockchain circa 2008. Over ten years ago now, but barely a drop in the boundless stream of time. This nascent technology soon planted its terrestrial roots and spread around many industrial sectors.",
    "content": "\"Oh my God...it's full of stars!\"\nThus spoke astronaut Dave Bowman, the last surviving crew member of the ill-fated Discovery One spaceship, moments before entering the stargate in the 1968 sci-fi classic 2001: A space odyssey. These eternal words, spoken in the novelized version only, hint at a vast new universe where human beings become something else, something entirely and eternally new. Hold on to that concept for now.\nPeople began hearing the word blockchain circa 2008. Over ten years ago now, but barely a drop in the boundless stream of time. This nascent technology soon planted its terrestrial roots and spread around many industrial sectors. These roots are now deeply entrenched, and while blockchain has become somewhat of an overused buzzword across certain quarters, the technology is sound. Blockchain is slowly coming of age, so it is time for it to start looking skywards and reach for the stars.\nHouston, we have blockchain: Decentralized technology breaking earthly bounds\nAs of 2019, spacefaring remains an expensive and very -very- risky enterprise. Several high-profile disasters, such as the loss of the Challenger and Columbia shuttles in 1986 and 2003 respectively, served as stark reminders that venturing into space can be a life or death situation with potentially disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, the space race continues, and several projects currently in development aim to send a manned mission to Mars sometime in the 2030s. Whether such a mission does come to lift-off within the planned timeframe remains to be seen, but space-related projects based on more feasible achievements are already underway through blockchain technology.\nBlockchain tech has already proved its viability down here on Earth. It started off as the engine that powered the development of cryptocurrencies, before evolving into something far more versatile. Industries such as entertainment, supply chain, medical, airlines, banking, and many other sectors have already seen the advantages that a blockchain platform can afford.\nBlockchain's main raison d'etre is decentralization. The disruption of the status quo through transparency and fairness. And the potential applications of this technology for space-related industries are as vast as space itself.\nSpace: The new frontier for entrepreneurship\nSpace is a huge expanse full of stars, worlds, nebulae, black holes, and probably myriad civilizations that we just have not been able to discover yet. The final frontier, as some say, and blockchain technology is ready and poised to take humanity where it has never gone before.\nBut let's roll back the dice of time sixty off years. Back then, the issue of space exploration was firmly in the hands of the superpowers of the era. The United States and the then Soviet Union scrambled to put a man into space. The Soviets won, as Yuri Gagarin completed one full orbit around Planet Earth on the Vostok capsule on April 12, 1961, though the Americans did manage to put the first human on the Moon.\nNASA in the United States, Roscosmos in Russia, and the European Space Agency (ESA) were, for a long time, the main players in the worldwide space industry. In other words, this sector was hugely centralized, and to an extent, monopolized. This monopoly was somewhat justified due to the astronomical cost of space-related R&D, which only government-sponsored agencies could afford to bear. But recent technological developments have enabled smaller companies to become active players in the space field. The name of this holy grail? Blockchain, of course.\nBlockchain tech has given many entrepreneurial minds, something that established names like NASA did not: An opportunity to thrive and develop their ideas. Blockchain opened a gateway for the creation of value, to find new ways to do business, paving the way to the stars, quite literally in this case.\nPractical applications of blockchain in space: Satellite communication, online shopping, and everything in between\nCueing back to the present day, blockchain has enabled two key aspects: democratization and decentralization of space.\nBut one question remains. Who exactly owns space, and who is entitled to do business up there? A number of international treaties signed in the 1960s intended space to be ‘humankind’ property. In other words, no one nation could claim a unique stake in it, no matter how many flagpoles were erected on the Moon or elsewhere. This, while certainly a fair and romantic notion, is far from the cold financial reality. Space is open for business, and anyone who can afford to put a spacecraft in orbit is likely to claim ownership of at least a small patch of vacuum. Fortunately, there are plenty of patches up for grabs.\nAnd this is where blockchain comes in. The decentralization power of this technology is perfectly suited for the needs of a sprawling orbital network of satellites, for example. But this network would generate a gargantuan amount of data, which would need to be analyzed and processed. Blockchain would provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure to support data processing.\nData processing and sharing is an interesting aspect of blockchain, particularly when applied to spacefaring. Long journeys, such as the planned manned mission to Mars, would generate and use large datasets. There currently is little or no satellite coverage on Mars, but future blockchain-powered networks could provide essential navigation information, for instance. And the possibilities go far beyond the confines of our own world. Blockchain could indeed become the fulcrum upon which rest the data sharing facilities on Mars' surface, should a permanent human colony ever be established there.\nCrypto-economy across the solar system, and what lies beyond\nBlockchain started life as the driving force behind cryptocurrencies. It has steadily evolved into something much more complex and far-reaching, and the next natural evolutionary step aims to conquer space.\nThe current economic framework here on Earth is largely driven by banks, which have enjoyed a hitherto uncontested hegemony on the financial realm. Not so anymore. The emergence of cryptocurrencies has defied the bank's former monopoly of wealth, and by extension, economic activity.\nThe global turnover for the space economy grew from just over $216bn in 2009 to over $410bn in 2018. This figure will only keep growing as more players become involved in the space race. Well-known names such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic both already operate the space-faring craft, for example.\nUsing blockchain beyond Earth's boundaries gives rise to an interesting proposition: The creation of a crypto-economy in space. Free of banks' shackles, an economic system powered by blockchain would flourish. Satellites placed at strategic points along a given route could be used to carry out transactions bypassing spacecraft. Payment of salaries, online shopping, and other amenities, could be available on board thanks to the power of blockchain.\nConclusion\nBlockchain technology recently turned a decade old, so it's still relatively in its infancy. To put this into perspective, telephone technology has been around for about 140 years. In other words, there is no telling what blockchain can do at this point.\nThe democratization of space economy is worth the entry price alone, but alongside blockchain's other traits such as transparency, speed, and security, make it the perfect candidate to become a pioneering endeavor for the benefit of all mankind. The future is indeed full of stars.",

NUS claims the HaptGlove simulates touch and grip more realistically than conventional gloves.",
    "content": "In recent days, there has been a significant uptick in the daily sales volume of nonfungible token (NFT) trading cards belonging to the former President of the United States, Donald Trump.\nAccording to market analytics aggregator Cryptoslam, sales volumes on January 18 and January 19 saw surges of 800% and 600% respectively when compared to sales volumes on January 17.\nFollowing reports that the former president was seeking to rejoin Facebook and Twitter in advance of the 2024 presidential election campaign, some experts believe that the rekindled interest could be due to his imminent return to social media networks. This speculation comes after it was reported that the former president was seeking to rejoin these networks.\nOn December 15th, a collection of 45,000 self-themed trading cards was released, and the price of each card was originally set at $99 USD.\nCustomers who purchased the collection were instantly placed into a sweepstakes with \"thousands of prizes,\" some of which included one-on-one meals, zoom calls, and games of golf with the previous President.\nThey sold out very rapidly and achieved daily sales volumes of more than $3.5 million, but after that, their sales volume sank to a baseline of around $26,000 by the end of 2022.\nYuga Labs, the company that created Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has blocked the secondary trade of its \"Sewer Pass\" non-fungible tokens on markets that do not provide full support for creator royalties.\nIt is possible to mint the Sewer Pass, which serves as an admission pass to its new skill-based non-flip-to-win game called Dookey Dash, but only for those who are members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club or the Mutant Ape Yacht Club.\nAccording to the statistics provided by NFT Price Floor, The Sewer Pass has had a large amount of transactions on secondary markets, with a floor price of 1.81 ETH (which is equivalent to $2,809) and sales volumes of 15,627 ETH (which is equivalent to $24,267,411).\nSecondary sales of the collection have already brought in more than $1.2 million in income for Yuga Labs, which is based on a 5% creator royalty charge for the collection.\nAccording to the announcement, \"Neopets Metaverse\" will be a play-and-earn virtual pet game based on the original, and it would enable users to \"grow, care for, personalise, and combat with their Neopets\" on the blockchain. The game will be based on the original \"Neopets.\"\nNeopets was established in 1999, and its parent business has high hopes that its newest product, Neopets Metaverse, would reintroduce \"the magic of Neopets in a wonderfully fresh light to old-time gamers, as well as recruiting and fostering a new generation of Neopians.\"\nThe news has been received with a lacklustre reaction from the community, with some members speculating that the community's earlier attempt to create a Neopets metaverse was unsuccessful.\nResearchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a pair of haptic gloves that they hope will allow users to experience the feeling of touch in the metaverse.\nThe HaptGlove is an untethered and lightweight glove that will enable users of the metaverse to interact with virtual items in a manner that is much more realistic by communicating a sense of touch and grip. The innovation was developed by HaptLabs.\nWhen users put on the HaptGlove, they are able to sense when their virtual avatar's hand touches something, as well as tell how hard the object is and what shape it is. This is made possible by the HaptGlove restricting the user's finger positions, which enables users to sense when their virtual avatar's hand touches something.\nAccording to NUS, the HaptGlove will also be valuable in other fields, such as education and medicine, since it will enable surgeons to practise their procedures in a \"hyper-realistic environment\" and will provide students with the opportunity to gain practical knowledge via hands-on practise.\nAlthough the idea of haptic gloves is not new, as for example, Meta is now working on their own version of them, NUS say that theirs is capable of providing users with a far more realistic feeling of touch in comparison to other haptic gloves that are already on the market.\nIt has been suggested by those working on metaverse games that because virtual reality is such an immature technology, it is difficult to incorporate it into metaverse products. As a result, games like The Sandbox and Decentraland have not yet fully incorporated virtual reality clients into their gameplay.\nRarible, a marketplace for NFTs, made the announcement on January 18 that it was going to extend its marketplace builder to accommodate Polygon-based NFT collections.\nThe cryptocurrency exchange Binance made an announcement on January 19 that it would be tightening its rules for NFT listings. As part of the new regulations, the exchange will require sellers to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and have at least two followers before they can list their NFTs on the platform.",

    "content": "Asset tokenization will expand into a US$16.1 million business opportunity by 2030, according to a joint report published by BCG and ADDX.\nThe report suggested that the growth forecast was made by studying the potential of the crypto winter as it has been prompting capital to focus on more viable blockchain use cases.\nAccording to the BCG and ADDX report - titled \"Relevance of on-chain asset tokenization in ‘crypto winter’\" - the drive behind the projected growth in tokenization of assets is also due to demand from a wide range of investors for more access to private markets.\nAsset tokenization refers to the creation of tokens on a blockchain to represent an asset in order to facilitate more efficient transactions. The tokenization and fractionalization of assets lower barriers to investment in private markets by reducing minimum lot sizes.\nThe report indicated that \"assets being fractionalized and tokenized on platforms such as ADDX can reduce minimum investment sizes from millions of dollars to just thousands of dollars.\"\n\"Previously, investments of this kind were only available to institutions. Tokenized investments can also be effectively ‘borderless’, allowing investors around the world to invest in markets they were previously unable to access,\" it added.\nBacktracking to previous years, assets globally were also held in illiquid formats, and past studies have estimated that the share of illiquid assets was at more than 50% of overall assets.\nIn comparison to asset tokenization, illiquid assets face challenges such as imperfect price discovery and trading discounts compared to liquid assets, according to the BCG and ADDX report. However, tokenization is simple as it creates liquidity by making it easier for the assets to be distributed and traded among investors.\nThe BCG and ADDX report has also listed five indications - increased trading volume in tokenized assets, strengthening stakeholder sentiment across many countries, recognition among monetary authorities and regulators, more asset classes being tokenized and a growing pool of active developer talent in the blockchain space - that asset tokenization may be on the cusp of wide global adoption.\nIn light of this opportunity, institutions have already begun tokenizing private funds on ADDX's platform. \"Partners Group listed its Global Value SICAV Fund on the platform in September 2021, while Hamilton Lane’siii Global Private Assets Fund launched on the platform in March 2022,\" according to BCG and ADDX.\nThe majority of global growth in tokenized assets is expected in real estate, equities, bonds and investment funds, as well as less traditional assets such as car fleets and patents.\n\"With a 50-fold increase predicted between 2022 and 2030, from US$310 billion to US$16.1 trillion, tokenized assets are expected to make up 10% of global GDP by the end of the decade,\" the report states.",

    "summary": "Damage estimates were $120 million.",
    "content": "The blockchain security company CertiK suggests that the amount of harm that was done to the decentralised protocol BonqDAO on February 1 may have been far less than what was previously believed.\nAccording to information provided by CertiK, the attacker started by taking out a loan for 100 million BEUR, which is a euro stablecoin, using less than $1,000 as collateral since there were no limitations on the ratio of collateralization. If users set the parameter to zero, then the platform will provide the \"largest value of uint256\" as the default action. This will make it possible for an incredible number of loans to be distributed.\nHowever, according to CertiK, the hacker was only able to withdraw approximately one million dollars due to a lack of liquidity on the platform. This is despite the fact that the attacker borrowed a total of one hundred million BEUR (approximately one hundred twenty million dollars at the time of the attack). Earlier reports from blockchain security companies such as PeckSheild suggested that the hack resulted in losses of about 120 million dollars.\nThe Liquity Protocol was forked into Bonq, and both blockchains employ Troves to represent discrete debt positions. Bonq is a fork of the Liquity Protocol. On the other hand, reports indicate that Bonq has introduced a Community Liquidation Feature, which resulted in the liquidation of 45 Troves that had exposure to BEUR. CertiK reports that the hack also affected Troves, each of which had around 110 million Alliance Block tokens (ALBT). However, none of the Alliance Block smart contracts were compromised during the event, and the team behind the project has promised to distribute replacement tokens through an airdrop as a form of compensation to the holders of tokens who were harmed.\nAlthough it looks that BonqDAO suffered less loss as a result of the occurrences due to a lack of liquidity, other participants were not as fortunate. On October 12, DeFi protocol Mango Markets suffered an initial loss of $116 million as a result of hacker Avraham Eisenberg's manipulation of the price of the MNGO token price. Eisenberg drove the price up 30 times using huge perpetual future contracts in a short amount of time. Because of the limited liquidity, this was feasible since the amount of initial cash needed to control MNGO was only somewhat significant.\nAfter that, Eisenberg obtained a loan for $116 million using the $423 million of his inflated MNGO holdings as security and stole cash from the platform. He did this simultaneously. On December 28th, Eisenberg was taken into custody in Puerto Rico on suspicion of manipulating the value of commodities and committing commodities fraud.",

    "content": "Following its quarterly burn, the Binance (BNB) Chain has successfully eliminated $548 million worth of BNB, a move that has left the market relatively unaffected.\nCrypto exchange platform Binance in its latest news, announced it had successfully destroyed approximately 2,065,152.42 BNB.\nThe exchange platform also stated that an added 4,833.25 BNB was part of the burn through its Pioneer Burn Program – a burning program that favors those who genuinely lost their digital assets.\nBinance takes responsibility for these losses in the Pioneer Burn Program by deducting tokens (lost by users through honest mistakes) in the quarterly burn and then refunding the users depending on some specific conditions.\nBinance launched the BNB coin in 2017, and ever since, the exchange platform has been committed to burning a large amount of BNB coin every quarter. Initially, Binance started the BNB burn mechanism by buying back BNB coins with 20% of their profit and then destroying it until they bought back and burned 50% of BNB (100MM).\nHowever, in December 2021, the exchange platform introduced a new burning mechanism that relies on automatic on-chain calculations.\nThis means the BNB auto-burn system weighs the amount of BNB to be burnt automatically based on the price of BNB and the number of blocks produced during the quarter. In spite of the large amount of BNB coins burnt, the market seems rather unaffected by it, with the BNB coin moving downward and still hovering around $260 – at the time of writing.\nSpeaking of BNB, last week, the BNB blockchain suffered an on-chain hack that occurred on a bridge between blockchains. According to Binance, an estimated $100 million to $110 million of BNB tokens were stolen due to this hack.",

    "content": "Polygon Labs, the leading blockchain technology firm, issued a response today to a proposed rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that redefines the term \"exchange.\" The company argues that the proposed rule could pose a severe risk to the existence of permissionless blockchain networks and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols within the United States.\nThe SEC's reopening release suggests that not only DeFi software protocols enabling specific transactions on a permissionless, distributed ledger would have to register as a national securities exchange (NSE) or an alternative trading system (ATS), but also, the underlying ledgers or networks. Further, individuals or entities running or maintaining such systems would also need to register.\nPolygon Labs has pointed out that the new rule would be logistically unworkable, given the structure of blockchain technology. They highlight that the numerous independent validators of blockchain transactions cannot practically coordinate to register as an exchange, and these validators, by design, don't control DeFi protocols.\nThe blockchain technology firm also criticizes the SEC's proposal for its technological bias. It asserts that the rules are inconsistent, treating blockchain technology differently from other technological infrastructures such as cloud-based systems. The SEC's release proposes that any part of a blockchain-based system, including validators, must register, compared to only requiring the deployers of apps on cloud systems to do so. This approach, according to Polygon Labs, embodies a clear technological bias.\nIn its response, Polygon Labs maintains that implementing the proposed rule would effectively ban all permissionless blockchain networks in the U.S., as well as many software protocols built atop such networks, including DeFi protocols. The company's critique underscores the high stakes at hand, drawing attention to the potential impact of the SEC's proposed rule on the future of blockchain technology within the country.\nThe SEC has yet to respond to Polygon Labs' critique, but this latest exchange underscores the increasing tension between regulatory bodies and the blockchain industry, as each navigates the complexities of new technologies and their implications for financial systems.",

    "content": "Lawmakers in the US are coaxing the federal government to consider a national blockchain strategy for regulation and growth, citing China’s Blockchain Service Network as an example.\nUS Wakes up to Blockchain\nA document released earlier this week shows House Rep. Brett Guthrie calling for a detailed study into blockchain technologies and their impact across industry, international financial frameworks, and governance.\nIf passed, the independent bill will provide the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with two years of budget and time allocated towards the design, philosophy, and research of distributed ledger technology (DLT).\nIn the bill, Guthrie calls for blockchain adoption and use in the various avenues, such as the state, corporate organizations, broader blockchain development, use in risk mitigation, consolidation of prohibitive federal statutes, and even legislative frameworks.\nThe bill notes US allies already have a blockchain strategy in place, such as Germany and France. In addition, it states the 2-year-study must include detailed plans of over 10 countries working towards blockchain development or including the protocol as part of larger plans.\nWhen all is said and done, the strategy will help create a “comprehensive” blockchain-based organization for the United States.\nInterestingly, Guthrie cites China’s influence and progress in blockchain technology as something to be wary about, stating:\nHe indicated staying a step ahead of China is crucial, even more in times such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n“The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has made it clear that we need to maintain American leadership in technology,” he said in the statement. “America is a nation of innovation and enterprise – and we need to keep it that way.”\nChina, for all purposes, is currently leading the world in blockchain study, framework, and regulation. Highlights include the creation of a national blockchain strategy (BSN), pilot projects on digital currencies, and dedicating entire areas towards DLT research and development.",

    "content": "A reportpublished by research projections from Binance released figures which amounted to ETH (Ether), averaging a correlation coefficient of 0.69. The research showed the following comparative values; “Ether is the highest correlated asset. With an average correlation coefficient of 0.69 throughout 2019, it is consistently among the most correlated assets. The coefficient started at 0.69 in Q1 and rose to 0.72 in Q4 (Q2: 0.65; Q3: 0.74).” Findings from the report show that Ether was relatively less correlated in the earlier half of 2019. The incline of its correlation began in the second half.\nWhat was most interesting is that research shows that ‘programmable blockchains,’ for instance, Ethereum, NEO, and EOS showed moderately higher correlations in comparison to non–programmable assets. The most significant contrast was amongst those assets with the lowest correlation, namely Cosmos, standing at a correlation of 0.31. To add are Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ) at coefficients of 0.32 and 0.4, respectively.\nThe “Binance Effect,” which was highlighted in the article, reveals that cryptos listed on Binance resembled higher correlations than those that are not listed. Additionally, the relationship between BTC and well- known commodities such as Gold is debatable, but recent data reveals that it is significantly less correlated than popular belief.",

The Chinese Blockchain Service Network (BSN), has been open for commercial use since April 2020, after six months of internal testing. The BSN provides small businesses and individuals to operate blockchain applications easily without using a private blockchain network. The network also aims to lower costs, estimating that hosting a decentralized application (Dapp) would only cost around $260 - $390 a year.",

    "content": "Frankfurt-based crypto asset management group Iconic Funds announced today that it has expanded the variety of its wrapped crypto exposures available to investors by launching the world’s first ApeCoin exchange-traded product (ETP).\nThis launch is the company’s fourth product to be physically backed by cryptocurrencies.\nThe crypto asset manager disclosed that it listed the Iconic Physical ApeCoin ETP on the Boerse Stuttgart on Wednesday with a total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%.\nThe ApeCoin ETP tracks the CMBI ApeCoin index (that includes Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin on its basket), therefore offering physical exposure to their underlying assets while being fully collateralized by Coinbase Custody.\nState Street, a US-based bank, will perform administrative services to support the issuance of the ApeCoin ETP.\nJust like other Iconic Funds crypto funds, investors in the ApeCoin ETP can apply for physical delivery of underlying coins, the company said.\nMichael Geister, head of crypto ETPs at Iconic, talked about the development and said: “The ETP will provide exposure to the ecosystem built around the Bored and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs developed by Yuga Labs. BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) is one of the most valuable NFT collections available, made famous by stars like Make Cuban or Serena Williams. Through ApeCoin investors have access to the growing NFT market.”\nBesides the launch of the product, the company also disclosed plans to partner with third parties to launch actively managed white-labeled crypto ETP products from its platform.\nPatrick Lowry, CEO of Iconic, further elaborated: “We look forward to issuing additional, highly innovative crypto ETPs in the near future, as well as partnering with incumbent financial institutions for white-labelled crypto ETP products.”\nLast year, the firm launched its first product (Bitcoin ETP) in the European market. The company then launched a carbon offset Bitcoin ETP, which was followed by Europe’s cheapest Ethereum ETP.\nEurope’s Crypto ETPs Seeing High Demand\nThe latest development by Iconic Funds shows that cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) continue heating up with a series of new listings in Europe. That is a contrast in the US with the prospects of a physical Bitcoin ETF that is still at a standstill in the region.\nIn 2020, crypto ETPs in Europe surpassed $1 billion in inflows and since then demands have continued to show no signs of slowing down.\nIn February this year, European digital asset-linked ETPs witnessed inflows of over $80 million.\nFinancial providers said that the increase in demand comes as no surprise. The convenience and security of cryptocurrency exposures via a regulated product are attractive to both retail and institutional investors.\nIn February this year, Fidelity International became the latest issuer of a European ETP with the launch of its Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETP on Germany’s Deutsche Börse Xetra.\nEarly that month, 21Shares expanded its crypto exchange-traded products with the launch of three DeFi ETPs. The firm launched DeFi products (including Aave, Chainlink, and Uniswap (UNI) as their underlying assets on the BX Swiss exchange.",

While the value and power of cryptocurrency have been steadily recognized in parts of Africa due to necessity with inflation and remittance, this type of adoption is not taking place within the African American community.\nThe African-American community is in the majority recognized to be at an economic disadvantage, with an existing legacy financial system propelled by unethical practices such as redlining, among others. However, cryptocurrency, by its nature, could serve to rectify such circumstances and level the playing field for all involved.\nOn Feb. 23, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, tweeted his support of a new book that promotes Bitcoin’s substantial potential benefits to the African-American community. Dorsey, whose Twitter platform now hosts about 330 million users globally, told his own 4.3 million followers how Bitcoin could prove to be a potential lifesaver to the African-American community.\nThe book, Bitcoin and Black America, written by Isaiah Jackson, offers a breakdown of the role cryptocurrency can take in the African-American perspectives, a group with a history of being underserved by major financial bodies. As noted by the writer, it is quite surprising that black people in the US are yet to embrace cryptocurrency despite the fact that it offers a potential route to financial autonomy.\nCall for change in perception of cryptocurrency to the African-American community?\nAccording to Jackson, one of the major problems among the African-American community is their outlook on cryptocurrency. Although they are not the only group that sees Bitcoin as a potential scam, with news of several schemes being employed to exploit the lack of regulations in place for cryptocurrency, Misinformation coupled with lack of banking access has made investing in cryptocurrency less appealing among the black people in the United States.\nIn his book, Jackson called for a quick change in order not to miss the potential benefits that could be derived from the use of Bitcoin. His sentiment seems to have been shared by the Twitter CEO, as shown in his tweet yesterday. Recently, Jack has also been seen to show interest in this space as he has made efforts to come up with a decentralized social media platform earlier this year.",

While this money is not liquid, with cryptocurrency it very quickly could be, and Buterin will not be obligated to pay any tax on these gains unless he sells the crypto, which would mark a realized profit.\nFactoring back in the original $52 million from March 2020 plus the $158,777,000, at time of writing Vitalik Buterin’s net worth should be roughly over $210 million dollars.\nButerin Turned Down Google\nBack in August 2018, it was revealed that Buterin had once been approached by Google who tried to hire the young computer engineer on an intern’s salary.\nTech giant Google approached the Ethereum founder to work on its own cryptocurrency projects, but clearly for Buterin the dollars offered did not make sense.\nAccording to Business Insider, the incident happened in 2018 and as Vitalik Buterin already had a net worth in the millions, he treated the job offer as a joke or an algorithm result of the hiring process.",

But moving forward, there is a strong indication from ByteDance that blockchain could be a long-term solution to fight similar problems.\nReported last December, Tik Tok Owning Company Bytedance has strongly started investing in blockchain technology with other Chinese Companies.\nWith the above security flaws found in their app, allowing hackers to take control of user accounts, the social media giant has a significant task of correcting problems quickly and ensuring that new systems put in place can improve user protection. Security and account protection are the two main areas that ByteDance is aiming to solve, protecting users from malicious links and hackers uploading videos and media on their accounts.\nData protection on social media are crucial elements for all data-heavy services; after Facebook's problems, it was clear that all privacy and policies must be created and held to high standards for users.\nMoving further into 2020, the surrounding problems and investment made into blockchain shows a strong desire to design and improve security by ByteDance and, in turn, Tik Tok.\nWith long term partnerships created and blockchain advancement in the works, it could be yet another strong year for the social media giant.",

    "content": "CEO Michael Saylor revealed in a recent interview that MicroStrategy’s $425 million Bitcoin investment was part of its corporate 100-year outlook and the firm's strategy to adopt the Bitcoin Standard.\nMicrostrategy CEO Michael Saylor said the company will hold onto its Bitcoin holdings for the next 100 years—with absolutely no plans to sell.\nSince its purchase of 21,454 BTC on Aug 11, Microstrategy’s initial Bitcoin investment has gained close to $30 million in just over two months. The firm also made a $175 million second BTC investment in September.\nSpeaking to Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal on Oct. 21, Saylor confirmed his BTC strategy had been the result of planning and discussion amongst the business intelligence firm’s board of directors, investors, auditor and executives.\nSaylor revealed that Microstrategy began to explore assets that could act as a safe haven or long-term store of wealth after a decision had been reached by the firm to restructure its treasury—in response to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 economy.\nAccording to the Microstrategy CEO, Bitcoin was the only asset that provided a strong 100-year outlook. Saylor argued that other assets they explored were all vulnerable to taxation and fees or too centrally controlled by governments or corporations.\nSaylor said during the interview:\nSaylor was also critical of other cryptocurrencies, claiming that Bitcoin was proven while Ethereum is not yet done with its functional architecture. The Microstrategy CEO said that when comparing BTC with other cryptos, the choice is obvious. He said, “the market screaming to you there is a winner.”\nIt’s not just cryptos that Bitcoin trumps, according to Saylor BTC also easily bests traditional stores of value like cash and gold. He said:\nWhen comparing Bitcoin to gold, Saylor cited the crypto assets history of increasing in value, its scarcity and limited supply and its functionality in terms of storage and transport of wealth as features gold could not match.\nSaylor also adamantly expressed to Pal that contrary to speculation in the crypto market that the business intelligence firm is trying to capitalize on a fast pump and dump, Microstrategy is thinking long-term on Bitcoin. He said:\nInstitutional Bitcoin Pays Off\nWhile Microstrategy is no doubt feeling pretty pleased with their decision to invest in Bitcoin as the crypto made its bull run this week, but they aren’t the only company celebration.\nGrayscale Investments is also sure to cause Bitcoin FOMO among institutions still afraid to venture into BTC, as CEO Barry Silbert announced a breathtaking increase of $300 million in AUM after a single day this week—as BTC price surged to new highs for the year.\nThe Bitcoin price is $12,933.05 at the time of writing.",

    "content": "This year, top sports franchises from football, racing, and now NBA has brought crypto and blockchain adoption to new heights. With teams from each sport implementing blockchain technology to ensure authentic in-game gear, including jerseys, shirts, balls, and more can be confirmed and allow fans worldwide to feel safe in making purchases. The Sacramento Kings have been early adopters in the crypto space and have now added blockchain security into their business. It began in 2014 when the team became the first NBA side to accept Bitcoin payments and then moved onto mining Ethereum. Now leveraging the underlying technology, the Kings have added blockchain into their service to help fans purchase and trace real in-game gear so they don't end up with their neighbor’s old shirt with a suspect player signature.\nWith huge brands endorsing blockchain by implementing the technology, efforts to raise awareness and make adoption easier continue to improve. Sports fans should rejoice as for them, this means that those special signed and worn gear that they buy can be proven easily to be 100% real and not counterfeit. Counterfeiting in sports gear is a huge market, with as much as 1.2 trillion USD in value stolen to date across clothing industries.\nBlockchain fights this problem in multiple ways:\nFrom the moment any player takes off their shirt, the data can be logged and submitted along with tracking so that the time for counterfeiting and illegal practices are entirely cut out.\nEstablishing the flow and timeline proves where the items come from, who has approved the transaction and when. Anytime the items are transferred after, the purchase and sales history, along with proof of ownership, coming from transparency and special tagging, makes any further transfers follow the same principle. Leading to protection against counterfeit goods.\nWith fans around the globe willing to buy their favorite players items, team memorabilia and more, this is a great step in ensuring that fans get the exact item for which they have paid.",

    "summary": "Hong Kong is planning to shift to a friendlier approach towards cryptocurrencies starting next year, according to a Bloomberg report, while neighbouring Singapore is planning to impose fresh restrictions on consumers.",
    "content": "Hong Kong is planning to shift to a friendlier approach towards cryptocurrencies starting next year, according to a Bloomberg report, while neighbouring Singapore is planning to impose fresh restrictions on consumers.\nPeople familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, told Bloomberg that the information is not public yet, but Hong Kong has a planned mandatory licensing program for crypto platforms that are set to be enforced in March next year, which will allow retail trading.\nThey added that further details and program timetable are yet to be decided as public consultation must be done first.\nHong Kong is not planning to endorse specific coins such as Bitcoin or Ether. However, regulators are planning to allow listings of bigger tokens and legalize crypto trading for retail customers, according to Bloomberg.\nThis move indicates a positive regulatory measure for cryptocurrencies, which is in contrast with the city's sceptical stance in recent years.\nThe city plans to reveal more about the details of the recently stated goal of creating a top crypto hub next week during the annual Fintech Week conference, which starts on Monday.\nHong Kong is shifting to a friendlier approach towards crypto as the city aims to regain its credentials as one of the top financial centres after recent years of political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic led to the outward migration of talent.\nThe people familiar with the matter added that crypto regulators would likely demand criteria for listing tokens on retail exchanges, such as a company's market value, liquidity and membership in third-party crypto indexes.\nWhile other economies are starting to open up to cryptocurrencies, Singapore has said it is unwilling to change its regulations. Instead, it is strengthening restrictions on retail crypto trade.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday unveiled a proposal to restrict retail participation in digital assets. Following this, small investors will be banned from funding coin purchases through borrowing.\nSingapore's central bank chief Ravi Menon told Bloomberg that the city-state would not stand in the way of other financial centres looking to draw retail crypto trading away with more relaxed rules.\n\"We don't set ourselves out to compete with other jurisdictions, especially on regulation,\" said Menon, the managing director of the MAS. \"We have to do what is right for us, what is necessary to contain the risks. And the risks primarily harm retail investors.\"\nSingapore's central bank echoed sentiments similar to that of the MAS by asking companies to stop using tokens deposited by retail investors for lending or staking to generate yield. However, the restrictions proposed by the two regulatory bodies will not be applicable to high-net-worth investors.\nThese moves are being taken in Singapore to ensure positive growth of the crypto industry with security measures that will provide safety to investors.\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, Menon said Singapore still wants to be a crypto hub, but one that promotes areas of digital assets with \"use cases\" and tokenization - the process of using blockchain technology to securitize various assets.\n\"We accept that cryptocurrencies have a place in the larger digital ecosystem because they are the tokens native to the blockchain that powers much of this activity,\" he said. \"They need to have an expression in the formal financial sector.\"\nMeanwhile, other economies in Asia, such as neighbouring Japan, have already begun to take a positive stand toward crypto. The country has already started to open its economy to crypto by making it easier for companies to list tokens, which is in contrast to its previous conservative stance that was partially to blame for driving away crypto start-ups.\nIn early October, Japanese Prime Miniter Fumio Kishida announced that the government will take an active role in promoting Web3 services.\nKishida said Web3-related growth – including metaverse and NFT-related developments – is now part of the country's growth strategy. He added that the government is keen on creating a society where new services can easily be created.\nOn October 3, the prime minister delivered a speech before Japan's National Diet (Japan's bicameral parliament) where he said the government's investment in the country's digital transformation already embraces the issuance of NFTs to local authorities using digital technology to solve challenges in their respective jurisdictions.\nWhile in August, the Japanese government proposed a corporate-friendly crypto tax that would take effect in 2023. The prime minister's plan of revamping the economy relies on spurring growth in Web3 firms as a key agenda.",

    "title": "Blockchain, Bitcoin, Libra, Facebook",
    "summary": "What’s Bull___, Brilliant and Big Brother? Deep diving & examining where the real value is.",
    "content": "I've been told my \"definition\" of Blockchain differs from the “commonly used” one.\nThis is probably true, so I decided to examine why.\nFirst of all, what’s meant by “commonly used”. I have a problem with this idea because I'm yet to understand the parameters of \"commonly used\", and am still trying to understand what anybody is actually referring to when they begin to throw the word \"blockchain\" around [with so much certainty].\nA number of years ago, I found myself personally entangled in the term \"blockchain\", attempting to explain it to people at the local \"bitcoin & blockchain\" meetups I was hosting. The argument centred around grouping data in blocks & cryptographically hashing it to the data in the previous block in an attempt to build some form of \"immutable ledger\" (another term that gets thrown around) that could act as the basis of a more secure method of data storage.\nWhilst on the surface, this sounds interesting, in reality it’s neither special, unique, profound or even useful.\nI still remember the \"aha\" lightbulb moment where I realised that this concept was not the basis of Bitcoin’s immutability, & that immutability of the historical data on the ledger had very little to do with hashing to the previous block & everything to do with using that data structure/methodology together with the economic game of probability that Bitcoin used to achieve autonomous consensus (ie; its inclusion of PoW in its solution to the Byzantine Generals problem, aka; Nakamoto Consensus).\nWhat I've since informed anyone I come across (or at least those who choose to listen) is that defining \"blockchain\" outside of the context of Bitcoin is like trying to define a carburetor without the existence of a car.\nBlockchain for Lettuce\nThe sad truth is that since Bitcoin's inception, there have been many, many attempts to take absolutely necessary parts out of the Bitcoin Recipe (see page 5 of https://bitcointimes.news) in order to deliver something called a \"blockchain\" - for just about every application imaginable.\nWhen one tries to understand the application or definition of their 'blockchain', you quickly realise it's just a glorified database, utilising some simple time stamps, & maybe data segmentation. Something we've had for decades, & in most instances, the use of which is completely pointless.\nIn a bid to stay ahead of the curve, the \"blockchain\" narrative evolved into \"DLT\"; standing for Distributed Ledger Technology, where the \"block\" part of the blockchain was removed & the \"distributed\" element (also part of the broader Bitcoin recipe) was now glorified. The new narrative is just a variation of the old. \"It's immutable because every validator has a record of the ledger\".\nThe problem this time around is that if every validator is known, or permissioned, then have we really created something new? One could argue that in some corporate applications where more checks & balances are required, or there is a need for shared decision making, this could be useful, but by no means is this immutable, broadly applicable, or as one of the ridiculous narratives goes; \"faster\".\nHaving more parties participate in validation is by definition slower - and that's fine - especially if you want more checks, but digital immutability is a binary term. You either have it or you don't. The private, permissioned distributed ledgers are not immutable in any way, because there is no cost to change the historical record - only a requirement to collude via the quorum of the group. If anything, DLT is just a glorified multi-party authentication system - which like I said, is fine in some cases - but not when painted with \"all the glorious things\" it's going to give the world.\nOpen, decentralized networks [insert blockchain word here] such as Bitcoin are immutable, distributed & happen to group transactions together to achieve autonomous consensus amongst network participants who do not know each other. The result is a digital network that is inherently tied to real world cost via real-world energy. The more energy & cost associated with the network, the greater it's degree of immutability.\nTherein lies the innovation.\nIt is unprecedented & its application to something that requires an extraordinary degree of censorship resistance, eg; a non-sovereign form of monetary unit, is where \"the killer app\" lies.\nNot IBM's \"Blockchain for Lettuce\".\nIs this recipe useful anywhere else?\nMany have argued that using the entire Bitcoin recipe, & applying its output (ie; digital immutability & censorship resistance) to things outside of a non-sovereign monetary network + unit is a good idea. Enter Ethereum, etc.\nWhilst I won't go into the details here, I am very skeptical of the need to apply immutability & censorship resistance (or make it an integral component of the stack) to many things in the world due to the inherent cost of doing so.\nI'm extremely skeptical of the idea of \"Dapps\". Even if we assume Ethereum is censorship resistant (the numbers don't add up), & that the Dapps are also actually decentralized (they're not), how many applications really need to have immutability or resistance to censorship as a native part of their stack? Maybe an \"ebay for Hitmen\" - but by & large, if you have an idea for an app, in today's day and age - just go spin up an AWS instance, and make it happen!\nBitcoin's unique recipe is very useful for a specific set of things, much like building a tank is useful for a specific set of things. Putting the tank on a race track or removing all the armour to make it faster & then sending it into battle are both misguided.\nThe Verdict?\nThe world Blockchain was popularised in 2013 & 2014 by groups of banking consortiums, who are inherently threatened by the disintermediation that Bitcoin presents.\nSeeing the banks, accounting & IT giants, like the Big 4, the IBM's & Accenture's of the world, tout DLT or Blockchain is just classic PR. They're announcements by large, (in most cases boring) corporates who are desperately trying to show that they’re still somehow “innovative”.\nSimilar to how they use (and exaggerate) the words “cloud”, or “Ai”, or “big data”.\nThere is very little innovation there. So I call Bull$#*%.\nOnto Libra\nLibra has red-pilled more people into Bitcoin recently than just about anything else.\nThe idea that a non-sovereign currency can be issued, by an entity which is not a government or a state has actually opened the minds of millions of people who could not perceive that earlier.\nThe fact that Facebook has circa 2bn people on their network makes it the largest community (country) in the world, & people’s ability to grasp the notion of that community having their own money is a much easier mental leap.\nOnce they make that leap, they then have an easier time understanding Bitcoin, as seen by the journey people like Joe Kernan from CNBC Squakbox are on.\nWhilst Facebook has used the term \"Blockchain\" in their definition of what Libra is, it’s actually an inaccurate representation. I won't do the argument as much justice as Jameson Lopp did, so I'll link to his article here:\nhttps://onezero.medium.com/thoughts-on-libra-blockchain-49b8f6c26372\nBut suffice it say; it's not a blockchain.\nIn fact, Facebook & the Libra consortium have ZERO interest in building their own “blockchain”.\nWhat they’re attempting with Libra is something so much larger, & it’s exactly why all the governments (big or small) are up in arms about it.\nLet’s think about it for a moment.\n- Libra is in direct competition with government based fiat currencies (and they all know it)\n- Consider what a population in a jurisdiction with a weaker national currency would do if LIbra launches there. Why would a citizen hold their hard earned wealth in something that’s depreciating by 10 - 20% per annum?\n- You quickly come to the realisation that there would be a “bank-run” on the national currency, with all the capital flowing onto Libra. The result would be catastrophic for the government in power, as it’s economic lever is the basis of its control of the population.\nGovernments are scared — and rightly so.\nFacebook is arguably the largest “country” in the world, & their currency would be more useful to more people than the fragmented fiat ones they’re using today.\nThis is the real play. Libra is attempting to do their own Bitcoin - they couldn’t care less about Blockchain.\nBitcoin is the “Killer App”.\nBitcoin is fundamentally unique.\nIts immaculate conception & organic introduction to the market, its initial broad based adoption for strong, libertarian reasons & the timely disappearance of the founder, leaving no “head of the snake” to cut off are just a few of the things that make it impossible to replicate.\nDigital scarcity, Bitcoin’s core innovation is by definition, a one-time event. Every other cryptocurrency, optimising for complex, turing complete smart contracts on the base layer, or faster payments are quickly being shown as irrelevant or short term noise.\nBitcoin’s focus on being a censorship resistant public network, owned by the participants, that’s broadly decentralised & organically priced by the market is the killer app.\nLibra by facebook reinforces all of the above, by making all other cryptocurrencies who optimised for the wrong thing obsolete, & giving us a strong contrast to what Bitcoin represents for the world, ie; a money of & for the people — that cannot be shut down, censored, confiscated or inflated.\nThis was a once-off opportunity.\nThe smart money knows this & Bitcoin will continue to suck up all the capital & liquidity whilst all the other noise (crypto) will continue to trend toward $0 against Bitcoin in both dollar terms & relevance.\nBitcoin VS Libra: The real showdown.\nLibra inherently validates Bitcoin.\nIt opens people’s minds to the idea of a floating, global currency that is not managed or issued by a state of government.\nThe question is, would you use it?\nOr would you prefer to use something like Bitcoin?\nWhilst there are similarities between them, I would argue that Bitcoin is the antithesis to something like Libra, which to me sounds like we’re jumping from the frying pan into the fire.\nWhilst I’m not a fan of government or central bank-decreed fiat money, I question the logic of moving from a global USD reserve to a Libra reserve.\nSounds a little like 1984 to me.\nNot to sound conspiracy theorist, but the idea of one party, or even a consortium of the “big boys” having the final word on the most important resource in society, ie; money, ie; the unit of account that measures the input of all participants in society + the world at large → sounds dangerous to me.\nThis, fellow readers, is why Bitcoin matters.\nIt’s exactly why Bitcoin optimised for censorship resistance, privacy & self-sovereignty, not “fast payments” or “smart contracts” like all the other now-irrelevant crypto’s did.\nAll of the “potential” that’s promised (amongst the noise) in crypto will be built on top of the most robust network. What remains to be seen is whether that’s Bitcoin, or whether that’s Libra (or both).\nA new Money is the real battle-ground.\nNot Blockchain.\nAnd in my mind, Bitcoin is the only real alternative to a potentially Orwellian future.\nVerdict on Libra?\nBig Brother.\nConclusion\nBitcoin is the most under-appreciated innovation in History, but as with all great zero to one innovations, it’s the contrarian aspect that makes it so much more profound.\nIn 1000yrs, the concept of money will very much still exist — because it’s the foundational element required for any society to function.\nMuch like the internet, Bitcoin is a public good — owned by the people — and by taking the only two finite resources that we know of (time & energy), Bitcoin is able to give the world a superior monetary network & unit that we can use to better collaborate & function as an open society.\nBlockchain is not an alternative, nor does it even matter & nor will it even be spoken about in the coming 5yrs. The real alternative is potentially 1984-stye big brother currencies, whether they’re government issued (eg; China’s social credit system), or issued by non-state consortiums with disproportionate influence in the world (eg; what FB is doing with Libra).\nIt’s the opt out of those that gives Bitcoin the brightest future of all.\nVerdict on Bitcoin?\nBrilliant.",

    "content": "Inspired by traditional index funds' success, Crypto20 (C20) was designed to reinvent how investors gain exposure to the broader crypto market. With cryptocurrencies long-term growth potential, an index fund is the perfect entry point for investors looking to generate exceptional returns without taking on excessive risk. Historically, passively managed index funds have outperformed comparable active funds. With the crypto market’s incredible growth, it'll be interesting to compare the index funds of the future to the previous generation.\nInvictus Capital’s C20 was the world's first cryptocurrency-only tokenized index fund which revolutionized investing in the crypto space. The Fund gives investors exposure to a diverse portfolio of the top 20 cryptos by market cap in a single, tradable token that can be liquidated at any time through the Invictus Investor Platform. C20 rebalances its positions weekly — a frequency optimized using data science techniques. By leveraging the efficiency enabled by the blockchain, the Fund is able to offer extremely competitive fees of 0.5% annually, whereas the industry average is 3%.\nWhile Crypto20 was the first, Crypto10 Hedged (C10) promises to be the next evolution of crypto index funds. It has many of the benefits of the original C20 with a dynamic cash hedge that offers upside exposure and downside protection for a smoother risk-return profile. This extra downside protection makes investing in cryptos more palatable for risk-averse investors. The cash held as a hedge during market downturns is used to generate additional revenue through margin lending. This enhances the Fund's performance while at the same time effectively reducing downside risk.\nPerformance\nFuelled by the crypto market's explosive growth in recent months, C20 and C10 have generated phenomenal returns of 394.80% and 311.67% over the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 also had an exceptional year by equities standards with a return of 29.25% (Yahoo Finance). The massive disparity in these funds' return potential goes to illustrate why cryptos have become so attractive to retail investors. It's possible to 4x your investment in a single year by investing in an index fund that tracks the broader crypto market. In comparison, the stable returns of traditional asset classes appear far less enticing.\nRisk\nCryptos are an inherently risky asset class, so reducing volatility is vital in order to make cryptos more accessible to a wider range of investors. This is what makes Invictus's crypto index funds so appealing because they have the fundamental benefit of having a high level of diversification, together with downside protection strategies in C10’s case. C10 is at its core about managing downside risk as its cash hedge allows investors the advantage of upside volatility while aiming to protect gains during periods of market stress. Both of Invictus's crypto index funds use weekly rebalancing, and they cap the weightings of a single crypto to ensure that no one asset dominates the portfolio, further improving the portfolio's diversification. While volatility in the crypto market is unavoidable, with this volatility comes opportunity. The 30-day realised volatility for C20 and C10 are considerably higher compared to the S&P 500, which indicates a greater risk profile. For investors willing to bear this additional risk, they have the potential to generate far superior returns.\nInvictus Capital has pioneered the next generation of index funds. The remarkable performance of C10 (420.40%) and C20 (153.06%) since their inception have shown that crypto index funds have a bright future ahead.\nInvestors can generate additional returns by staking their Invictus tokens.\nClick here to learn more about ICAP tokens.",

    "content": "Twitter’s Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has thrown his support behind the ongoing #EndSars campaign and protests in Nigeria with Bitcoin (BTC) donations. The protests aim to shine a light on police brutality in the African nation.\nDorsey revealed his support for the Nigerian movement via Twitter on Wednesday where he said:\n“Donate via #Bitcoin to help #EndSARS”\nThe ongoing #EndSars protests have plunged Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation into a state of unrest in which the youth population took to the streets to protest against the seemingly unending human rights violation imposed by a unit of the Federal Police Force dubbed Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS). Backed by the power of the state, the SARS unit was created to fight armed robbery, kidnappings as well as other criminal activities but over time, they have resorted to the extortion of the youth population particularly those who have a positive inclination to digital means of earning.\nWith the years gone by in which there have been calls from various quarters to reform the rogue SARS unit, the situation has only seemed to grow worse, and now, the youths are determined to protest until the SARS unit is disbanded and assurance of reformed police is given by the government to end all other forms of reported brutality.\nJack Dorsey’s Bitcoin donation came after funds raised to support the protests were reported threatened to be shut down by the government and the cryptocurrency savvy youth population resorted to a blockchain-backed alternative that is free from the power of the state.\nJack Dorsey Keeping Promises\nJack Dorsey who weighed in on the Coinbase’s ‘Apolitical’ controversy is undoubtedly living true to his words and believes that refusing to join societal discourse “leaves people behind.” With Jack donating to the massively trending #EndSars protest both on social media and across the streets of Nigerian cities, he has set an example that can further show the world the good cause bitcoin can be used for.\nBitcoin donations are not uncommon in the crypto-sphere, and as Blockchain.news reported, bitcoin donations were received to help fight the devastating effects and to provide reliefs to victims caught up in the Australian bushfires back in April",

    "content": "BitKeep's token swap service was attacked on Monday by an unknown hacker.\nThe multi-chain crypto wallet was robbed of $1 million in crypto tokens. The users who were robbed had approved their tokens on BitKeep's swap service - called a swap router - on the BNB Chain and Polygon.\nReports said that the stolen funds were later scattered through Tornado Cash's crypto mixer to avoid being traced.\nThe team tweeted, \"BitKeep Swap was hacked, and our development team has managed to contain the emergency and stopped the hacker. The attack was directed to the BNB Chain, causing a loss of about $1 million.\"\nThe hacker was able to seize users' funds by exploiting a previously contained logic error that allowed them to make a malicious call.\nThe exploit was exposed to the hacker as BitKeep's swap contract lacked input validation, which further allowed the hacker to spoof input values. It reveals that the hacker was able to make illegitimate swaps from addresses that had approved to spend on BitKeep’s swap router.\nVictims of the exploit shall be refunded, according to BitKeep.\n\"BitKeep will launch a compensation portal within 3 working days for all victims to apply for a refund,\" Bitkeep said.\nOther Recent Hacks\nAlthough small in comparison to other hacks, the hack on BitKeep is another case of exploits that have hit the crypto sector this month.\nAccording to Chainalysis, in October alone, more than $700 million has been lost across more than a dozen notable exploits.\nThe most recent high-profile hack was witnessed by Mango Markets, which came less than a week from Binance's BNB blockchain's $80 million hack.\nA hacker has stolen $100 million from Mango Markets in early October.\nThe trading and lending platform hosted on the Solana blockchain was exploited after manipulation in the price of Mango Market's native MANGO token via an oracle price manipulation attack.\nAccording to Blockchain.News Mango Markets confirmed via a tweet that the company had begun investigating the matter. \"We are currently investigating an incident where a hacker was able to drain funds from Mango via an oracle price manipulation. We are taking steps to have third parties freeze funds in flight,\" the tweet said.\nThe hacker's wallet was funded from an FTX exchange account.\nAccording to blockchain security firm Hacken's tweets, the hacker first opened an enormous size futures position, which resulted in MANGO token price pump. That further spiked the hacker's account collateral value and gave access to borrowing a large debt position across multiple coins on Mango Market's borrowing and lending platform.\nAccording to Hacken, the hacker was then able to borrow and steal roughly $114 million across various tokens since the price of tokens and their collateral was manipulated much higher.\nIt is yet to understand how, exactly, the hacker was able to inflate MNGO's value in the eyes of the Mango protocol, according to Robert Chen from blockchain auditors OtterSec.\nWhile in Binance's BNB blockchain hack case, $80 million worth of Binance Coins (BNB) were stolen after an exploit occurred on a bridge between blockchains.\nAccording to Chainalysis, the total revenue for crypto crime in the first half of this year stood at $1.6 billion, less than the figure recorded in the first half of 2021. The drop in crypto crime figures has coincided with a fall in crypto values. However, some forms of crypto-crime have risen in the last year, such as the value of hacked crypto assets has increased from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion.\nWhile Bloomberg reported that about $2 billion had been lost in crypto hacks this year, many of those hacks were perpetrated by North Korea-linked groups, and cross-chain bridges used to transfer tokens across blockchains have been a popular target.",

    "summary": "Blockchain technology can combat bias in AI systems through decentralized, transparent smart contracts, but challenges like scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance need to be addressed.",
    "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, concerns about bias within AI systems have garnered significant attention. Bias in AI refers to the systematic errors or inaccuracies in decision-making processes, often resulting from the unconscious prejudices of its developers or the data used to train the algorithms. Addressing bias in AI is crucial to ensuring fairness, equity, and safety across various applications, from hiring processes to judicial systems. In this context, blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution to mitigate bias and enhance transparency in AI systems.\nAccording to a post by CyberGhost, human biases can significantly influence AI algorithms, leading to discriminatory outcomes. For instance, if AI systems are trained on biased datasets, they may perpetuate and amplify existing societal inequalities. This highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches to address bias in AI and uphold ethical standards.\nBlockchain technology, known primarily for its association with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, offers a decentralized and transparent framework that can effectively combat bias in AI. Unlike traditional centralized systems, blockchain operates on a distributed ledger, where transactions are recorded across a network of computers. Each transaction, or in the case of AI, each decision made by the algorithm, is transparently recorded on the blockchain, making it immutable and tamper-proof.\nOne way blockchain can ensure the safety of AI systems is through the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In a DAO, decisions are made collectively by a community of stakeholders rather than a single centralized authority. By integrating blockchain into AI governance models, decisions made by AI algorithms can be subjected to community scrutiny and consensus, reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes.\nMoreover, blockchain enables the creation of transparent and auditable datasets for training AI algorithms. Data provenance, or the ability to trace the origin and history of data, is crucial for identifying and mitigating biases in AI. By recording data transactions on the blockchain, stakeholders can verify the authenticity and integrity of datasets, ensuring that they are free from bias or manipulation.\nFurthermore, blockchain-based smart contracts can be utilized to enforce fairness and accountability in AI systems. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In the context of AI, smart contracts can specify fairness criteria and penalties for biased decisions, thereby incentivizing developers to prioritize ethical considerations in algorithm design.\nImplementing blockchain technology in AI systems is not without its challenges. Scalability, interoperability, and energy consumption are among the technical hurdles that need to be addressed. Additionally, regulatory and legal frameworks surrounding blockchain and AI integration require careful consideration to ensure compliance with data protection and privacy laws.\nBias in AI poses significant risks to individuals and society at large, undermining trust and perpetuating discrimination. Blockchain technology offers a promising avenue for mitigating bias in AI systems through transparency, decentralization, and accountability. By leveraging blockchain's inherent features, we can foster more equitable and safe AI systems that uphold ethical principles and serve the greater good.",

    "content": "The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revealed its plan to kick start a proof-of-concept phase on the issuance of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) next year. The nation’s central bank reported that it was preparing its issuance capabilities in case of a surge in public demand for digital currency rose rapidly.\nResilience is of the Key\nThe BOJ report noted that one of the fundamental features of the CBDC would be resilience, even when faced with unforeseeable circumstances like power outages and network failures. It stated:\n“Offline use in times of system and network failures, as well as electrical outages, is also important for Japan, given the frequent occurrence of natural disasters.”\nAs a result, the digital currency will have offline capabilities making it more durable. The early experimentation phase will entail generating a test environment to check its functionality as a payment apparatus.\nIn July, the BOJ disclosed that it had identified two technical stumbling blocks in the issuance of its digital currency, namely resilience and universal access. Therefore, it seems it has set its eyes on overcoming the resilience challenge, having put the early testing phase in line.\nUniversal access entails granting entry to everyone, including those who do not use smartphones. The Proof of Concept testing is expected to tackle this technical hitch as it will ensure that the digital Yen is accessible, just like regular currency. Additionally, it will guarantee the availability of the asset should there be a natural disaster.\nStamping authority in the global markets\nIn the eyes of many nations owning a CBDC is instrumental in having control of the global markets. This can be shown by the fact that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), along with seven central banks, recently released a report identifying the foundational principles necessary for any publicly available CBDCs to help central banks meet their public policy objectives.\nOne of the principles highlighted the importance of CBDCs coexisting with cash and other types of money in an innovative and flexible payment system.\nThe BOJ has been making notable steps as it continues keeping a keen eye on the development of its digital currency. For instance, in July, it announced the appointment of lead economist Kazushige Kamiyama to head the payments and settlements department, which is at the helm of Japan’s exploration of its CBDC project.",

While research firm Crunchbase's data report stated that it has raised $7.1 million.\n\"In 2021, NFTs exploded into the mainstream consciousness in a way few could have imagined, and OpenSea grew almost 1000x practically overnight,\" Hollander said in a statement. \"We now have the historic opportunity to build a truly generational product.

    "content": "MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor went from cryptocurrency skeptic to Bitcoin bull in just seven years, but his eyes are for Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.\nNASDAQ listed business intelligence company, MicroStrategy has made the decision to use Bitcoin as its primary reserve currency, recently adding to it’s $250 million August BTC investment with an additional $175 Million in the safe haven digital asset last week.\nMicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor indicated in recent tweets that he sees a clear distinction between Bitcoin and other altcoins and heavily favor BTC, as evident by his company’s hedge strategy.\nIn a tweet on Sept. 20, Saylor noted the difference between crypto-asset networks (ie.Bitcoin) and crypto-application networks (ie.Ethereum). Saylor wrote:\n“When considering network dominance in the crypto industry, I find it clarifying to separate crypto-asset networks like Bitcoin from crypto-application networks like Ethereum & stablecoins. Bitcoin dominance has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017, to 93.57% today.”\nSaylor’s data however was a little selective for his twitter following as the data from Bitcoin Dominance only measures proof-of-work cryptocurrencies that are attempting to be money.\nBy other metrics, CoinMarketCap has the Bitcoin’s dominance at a yearly low of 56.67% on Sept 13, but this data also takes stablecoins like Tether into account.\nHowever, Saylor is intentionally selective when it comes to this data. Bitcoin Dominance’s figures do not include initial coin offerings or stablecoins, but rather “only includes coins using proof-of-work that are attempting to be money.”\nSaylor Leans to Bitcoin Maximalism\nMicroStrategy’s CEO Saylor appears to have done a complete reversal on his view of Bitcoin since 2013 when he tweeted: “Bitcoin’s days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.”\nAs mentioned, in recent weeks MicroStrategy has taken a huge bullish on Bitcoin, buying 21,454 BTC, worth $250 million at the time of purchase in August and added $175 million worth of capital allocation to the asset last week.\nWhen confronted with this statement by Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano during a podcast interview, Saylor admitted he doesn’t remember making the statement on Twitter.\nSaylor now argues that Bitcoin is a dominant safe-haven asset and said to Pompliano, “Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value.”",

He admitted the background of the organization would be a challenge. Still, he emphasized that users are able to examine the code behind the project, making sure that no backdoor access for the Communist party-led government:\nChina continues crackdown on crypto trading and mining activities\nChinese President Xi Jinping proposed to explore blockchain technology to “optimize the digital economy” in 2019.

    "content": "The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has named Professor Fatma Ozkul, a prominent specialist in blockchain technology and crypto assets, to the position. This appointment was made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey. This appointment, which will take effect on December 23, 2023, represents a substantial integration of blockchain and cryptocurrency knowledge within the framework of the nation's monetary policy.\nAccording to President Erdoğan, the hiring of Professor Ozkul is a component of a more comprehensive plan aimed at reorganizing Turkey's economic team. After achieving victory in the general election held in May, Erdoğan took the initiative to establish a new economic team. As part of this process, he appointed Hafize Gaye Erkan, a former banker at Goldman Sachs, to the position of governor of the central bank. This strategic decision is in line with Turkey's growing emphasis on digital banking, which was shown by the fact that the first testing of its digital currency, the Digital Turkish Lira, was successful in the year 2022.\nSince 2012, Professor Ozkul has been teaching accounting, finance, and auditing at Marmara University in Istanbul. His subject areas of expertise include auditing, accounting, and finance. Blockchain technology and digital assets have been heavily included in her academic and research endeavors, culminating in the release of a book on crypto asset accounting in the year 2022. When Professor Ozkul takes up her new position on the Monetary Policy Committee, she will offer her substantial knowledge and experience in digital finance to the process of establishing benchmark interest rates, which is an essential instrument for controlling inflation in Turkey.\nThe political and economic climate in Turkey has offered favorable conditions for the use of Bitcoin. Chainalysis, a company that specializes in blockchain analytics, reports that Turkey recorded nearly 170 billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency transactions between July 2022 and June 2023, placing it in fourth place worldwide in terms of raw transaction volumes. Because of the recent spike in cryptocurrency activity, the Turkish government is considering the possibility of enacting laws for the cryptocurrency industry, with a particular emphasis on licensing and taxes. The objective is to reduce Turkey's status on the \"grey list\" maintained by the Financial Action Task Force and bring it into conformity with global financial norms.",

    "content": "Multinational cybersecurity provider Kaspersky has announced that the notorious North Korean crypto criminal group, Lazarus, is planning on releasing a new ransomware.\nKaspersky Investigates\nThe new threat, dubbed VHD, is designated to target internal networks of companies in the economic sector. In regards to why the ransomware group often resorted to working in solo ops, Kaspersky researchers presented their hypothesis:\nPhishing For Crypto And Sensitive Data\nThe infamous North Korean ransomware group Lazarus have been reported to have multiple tricks up their sleeves. In fact, according to cybersecurity Cyfirma, Lazarus is preparing a huge phishing campaign, that is meant to target at least 6 nations and over 5 million businesses and individual investors.\nThe report of the devious scheme was released in June. For the time being, there are no signs of the phishing campaign unfolding yet, as it appears that the North Korean ransomware group have not yet deployed the mass phishing campaign.\nHowever, as the hacking group have kept their digital heists alive in 2020, Cyfirma thought it best to warn major companies for prevention purposes.\nLazarus’ Notoriety Precedes Them\nIn the past, the North Korean ransomware group, operating under “Lazarus,” have made quite an impression on cybersecurity firms, having accumulated over $571 million in stolen cryptocurrencies since 2017. Lazarus group is notorious for hitting up cryptocurrency exchanges and have kept up their act of ransoming victims for cryptocurrencies, amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n2019 Digital Heist\nLast year, as reported by Chainalysis, Lazarus pulled off a digital heist that amounted to $7 million in various cryptocurrencies.\nThe ransomware group hit up DragonEx crypto exchange, a Singapore-based money exchange. In order to pull off their crypto scam, Lazarus created a fake trading bot website that was offered to employees of the DragonEx exchange.\nThe North Korean criminal organization used a sophisticated phishing attack, where a real website and social media pertaining to it were linked to a fake company called “WFC Proof.” The non-existent company was said to have created Worldbit-bot, a trading robot, that was then offered to DragonEx employees.\nFinally, the malicious software was installed on a computer that contained the private key of the DragonEx hot wallet, which enabled the North Korean-based group to steal cryptocurrencies from the Singapore exchange.\nLazarus Group: Anonymous or Not?\nLazarus’ malicious cyberattacks date all the way back to 2017. Though cybersecurity has not managed to completely arrest and stop the hacking group, identities associated with the North Korean hacking ring have been uncovered.\nEarlier this year, two Chinese citizens by the name of Tian YinYin and Li Jiadong were identified by the US treasury for their connection with Lazarus group. They were sanctioned in March by US authorities for their alleged involvement in laundering stolen cryptocurrencies from a 2018 cyberattack against a cryptocurrency exchange.\nWhile blockchain is still promoted as being cryptographically secured and the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, exchanges that hold them are still prone to cyber-attacks, just as traditional markets are not immune to heists and money laundering schemes.\nKorea: Training Military or Cybercriminals?\nPreventing financial theft has been an ongoing issue for the longest of times.\nWith a series of money-related attacks leading to a subsequent UN investigation last year, there is an ongoing hypothetical circulating around the law enforcement industry that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) may be heavily involved in coordinating cyberattacks, as they have reportedly been training cybercriminals to target and launder stolen funds from financial institutions.",

    "title": "Social Factors Influencing the Adoption of Blockchain Technology",
    "summary": "Some factors could be necessary to drive the increase in the use of Blockchain technology are trust in what it has to offer and the level of awareness of this technology among people.",
    "content": "With the introduction of blockchain technology, there has been an influx of so many innovations in different industries, including the financial industry, the entertainment industry, as well as other areas of life.\nThe invention of blockchain can be compared to the invention of things like the steam engine, internet, electricity, the computer - which are all referred to as general-purpose technologies. These types of inventions have the potential to impact economies and social structures on a global level. As with all general-purpose technologies (GPTs), their success is dependent on the level of their adoption.\nGeneral-purpose technologies are responsible for most of the massive changes in the world. The steam engine ushered in the industrial revolution, which transitioned humankind from making products by hand to the mechanization of factories, and the computer did something similar. Every invention of general-purpose technology has always made life more comfortable and positively influenced our daily lives. Due to this fact, these types of inventions were mostly greeted with open arms.\nThere has been some level of uncertainties expressed by various regulatory bodies over cryptocurrencies, unlike most GPTs that endure less criticism to mass adoption upon creation, blockchain technology is at least ten years old and is still yet to see a substantial level of adoption.\nHowever, the level of resistance seen in this space has reduced substantially as its relevance becomes more evident.\nWhat are these social factors?\nTwo sociological factors are majorly influencing the adoption of blockchain technology, our trust in what it has to offer, and the level of awareness of this technology among people.\nTrust in what it has to offer\nThe first factor which is trust has to do with the level believe people have for a particular innovation based on their experience with it or the information in circulation about it. One of the major disadvantages to cryptocurrencies today is the fact that it has been affiliated with too many scams and scandals, given its anonymous nature of transactions. This has caused these individuals to question the people and structures around them, in search of a trustworthy and secure platform that is built on integrity.\nThe level of awareness\nGiven that blockchain is an innovation that had its applications come to major limelight recently, most people getting into the space love to research and explore as well as seek as to be exposed to current happenings. Also, given that blockchain can be a complicated concept to come to grasp with, in some cases, it requires interest to learn and understand what value it has to offer as a general-purpose technology.\nBased on a report by Coinbase, findings were outlined about the rising level of student interest in crypto, and an increasing number of courses focused on blockchain, cryptocurrencies, or bitcoin. They are also being taught across a range of disciplines. Going by the report, this interest in studying crypto at colleges and universities speaks volumes about the future of money and blockchain as a whole.\nIf any nation is going to push for the massive adoption of blockchain technology in the world, they are going to have to educate the population and provide them with the necessary resources to understand and use it.\nApart from these two social factors, some other significant factors are influencing the adoption of blockchain technology. According to a paper published at the University Of Technology, Australia – these factors are personal innovativeness and perceived value.\nPersonal innovativeness has to do with the willingness of people to venture into new information technology. This means that one of the social reasons people can adopt Blockchain is their level of innovation. While perceived value is the value people see a thing can bring to them, it is how people understand the usefulness and possible profitability of blockchain technology.\nThe main factor that permeates all other factors affecting the adoption of blockchain technology is ignorance. If the number of people that understand what blockchain is, grows, people would trust it more, innovate and build with it, regardless of what limitations there may be.",

    "content": "The Ukrainian government has planned to launch non-fungible tokens (NFTs) featuring unique digital artwork illustrating stories from its war with Russia.\nAccording to the Guardian, Ukraine has taken this move to fund its war efforts.\nAlex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation, announced that the NFT collection would be “like a museum of the Russian-Ukrainian war. We want to tell the world in NFT format.”\nThe Ukrainian government’s request for $60 million cryptocurrency donations has also passed, and a CryptoPunk NFT worth more than $200,000 was also included in it.\nUkraine admitted that besides buying military equipment, the money is also being used to support media programs to voice its fight against the Russian invasion. Bornyakov said, “we don’t use this fund to buy weapons at this point. We’re buying night-vision goggles, optics, helmets, bulletproof vests.”\nUkraine had first announced a proposal to sell NFTs on March 3, following the cancellation of plans to airdrop to people who had donated crypto to fight the war, according to online media, the Block.\nRussia has also received backlash from other countries for its war against Ukraine. Blockchain.News, citing Reuters reported that Japan had requested crypto exchanges to suspend transactions of crypto assets that are subject to asset-freeze sanctions against Russia and Belarus, following concerns from the Group of Seven (G7) nations, Reuters reported citing national officials.\nConcerns among the G7 economies have been growing as they believe that the Russian government is using cryptocurrencies to tackle financial sanctions imposed upon the country for invading Ukraine, the report added.\nThe US Treasury Department has also issued new guidance that has asked US-based cryptocurrency firms to stop transactions with sanction targets.\nMeanwhile, four payment service operators such as American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, have also announced the suspension of their operations in Russia in protest of the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.",

Be extremely cautious of ANY sudden events that require you to part with your funds: genuine events are usually announced in advance in order to allow users to prepare,” the company announced on its website.\nOn November 19, Phantom Galaxies Discord server was hacked by unknown hackers, who posted fraudulent announcements claiming that the game was launching an immediate surprise NFT mining event - a stealth mint. Following which the hackers directed the victims to a fraudulent crypto mining platform that charged users a 0.1 ETH “minting fee” and stole about 265 ETH (approximately US$1.1 million in total, Animoca Brands said.\nThe company emphasized that there is no evidence that smart contracts were compromised, and no funds were stolen from the game or its developer and publisher.",

The grand jury for the case was sworn in on May 7, 2019.\nTian and Li who also go by their GOT inspired online aliases, Snowsjohn and Khaleesi respectively, have been charged with stealing nearly $250 million worth of virtual assets between July 2018 and April 2019.\nAccording to the court documents, Tian and Li both held accounts at two different unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges. The pair violated legal requirements set out by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) by converting virtual currency into fiat currency in exchange for fees; the pair effectively operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business.\nTian and Li transferred over $100 million worth of Bitcoin between each other’s US accounts and China accounts engaging in a form of cryptocurrency laundering know as a “peel chain” before the hack occurred. Other forms of laundering mainly consisted of converting Bitcoin to USD, Chinese Yuan, and iTunes gift cards.\nTian and Li Linked to Lazarus Group\nAs announced by the US Treasury on March 2, Tian and Li have been identified for their connection to the North Korean state-sponsored cyber-crime syndicate known as the Lazarus group.\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has reportedly been training cybercriminals to target and launder stolen funds from financial institutions, with a series of attacks leading to a subsequent UN investigation last year.\nOn Sep. 13, 2019, the US Treasury identified the Lazarus Group, along with Bluenoroff and Andariel, as North Korean hacking entities based on their relationship to the DPRK’s primary intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RCB).\nThe court documents do not name either of the exchanges hacked, however, last November the South Korean exchange Upbit was the subject of an attack with a total of 342,000 ETH, a value of $50 million at the time, stolen from the Upbit Ethereum Hot Wallet.",

    "content": "Taking a page from North Korea, Venezuela is looking to skirt U.S. sanctions by using crypto.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced a crypto payment method that they will activate “very soon.”\n“The finance minister and Venezuela’s central bank have new instruments which we will activate very soon so that everyone can do banking transactions, as well as national and international payments through the central bank’s accounts. Venezuela is working within the cryptocurrency world,” Maduro said.\nThe payment system, Maduro claims, allows for “free national and international payments.”\nVenezuela’s turn to crypto comes as the petrostate suffers one of the worst economic crises in recent years. Juan Guaido, leader of the Venezuelan opposition and “acting president,” calls the move a sign of “desperation,” adding that “to resort to that kind of subterfuge emphasizes the economic crisis the regime is going through.”",

    "summary": "Within the first quarter of 2021, the cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in the retail and institutional sectors and their adoption of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the world's most valuable and widely traded cryptocurrency, reached an all time high of $56 445 per bitcoin, on the 22nd of February 2021.",
    "content": "Within the first quarter of 2021, the cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in the retail and institutional sectors and their adoption of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the world's most valuable and widely traded cryptocurrency, reached an all-time high of $56 445 per bitcoin on the 22nd of February 2021. There is no doubt that the word ‘cryptocurrency’ is receiving more airtime than ever before. Extremely well-respected CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, announced they invested 1.5 billion USD in Bitcoin in early February. This has since led to a rapid gain of momentum and trust in the cryptocurrency market, driving the price in a positive direction ever since.\n2020 proved to be one of the toughest financial years, with the global coronavirus pandemic impacting economies worldwide and bringing daily life to a grinding halt. Despite many industries struggling immensely, the cryptocurrency market one could say ‘mooned’, with the total market capitalization increasing by well over a trillion dollars in 2020. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on the 1st of January 2020 was at a mere $190 billion USD. Since then, we have seen an overall increase of roughly 720%, reaching a total market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion USD to date. This resulted in more than a 1.3 trillion USD increase in just over one year.\nWith this worldwide cryptocurrency adoption, many wonder if they should enter the realm of crypto assets too? There are currently around 8 509 cryptocurrencies available, therefore choosing how you want to enter this volatile market is proving to be a difficult choice for many. Invictus Capital has since introduced the Crypto10 Hedged fund (C10) in March 2019. C10 provides investors with exposure to the top 10 crypto assets by market capitalization. This fund aims to choose a basket of crypto assets to diversify your risk even further. Investing in a crypto hedge fund instead of directly in the market will be a more attractive option for many investors, especially those entering the market for the first time, because using a vehicle run by seasoned management is probably safer than direct market participation.\nSince its inception, this fund has gained immense popularity due to its unique cash hedging option, and we have seen a total performance to date of a 420% increase in value in under 2 years. This fund has been an excellent diversification tool aimed at risk-averse investors looking to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market and be somewhat protected from full exposure.\nC10 is an actively managed fund, using a cash hedging algorithm that converts the assets to cash in times of market distress. The fund will then re-invest the cash when the opportunity arises, and the market has somewhat recovered. Over the past few weeks, we have seen an increasing trend of investments into the C10 fund, with the Fund Value reaching new heights of above $9.4 million and a C10 token NAV (Net Asset Value) of $5.135.\nThese tremendous results are a direct representation of the fund’s brilliant performance in a highly volatile market and the effectiveness of the fund's algorithm. Due to the extremely competitive nature of the crypto market to date, C10 aims to ride the bull market and offer high returns to investors with an added “insurance policy” as a hedge, providing a lower risk investment. With a market that is scaling at a rapid pace, reaching new standards daily, and with so much future potential, Crypto 10 Hedged is one of the best investment tools on the market. Given the history of C10, the hedging algorithm unquestionably equip’s investors in this unpredictable market.",

    "content": "The famous Oscar actor Anthony Hopkins' new film called \"Zero Contact\" will premiere on the new platform Vuele in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It will be the first feature-length movie sold in the form of NFT.\nThe film is produced by independent film finance and production company Enderby Entertainment, with Rick Dugdale as producer and director and Cam Cannon as a screenwriter.\n\"Zero Contact\" was produced remotely in 17 different regions using zoom and other shooting techniques. It tells the story of five characters from all over the world only because of their love for the tech giant Finley Hart (Hopkins), according to Deadline Hollywood. They are connected to destroy a secret experiment that will lead to the end of life on earth led by Finley Hart.\nEnderby's producer/director Rick Dugdale said that he chose to distribute by NFT because of the non-copy ability of the NFTs, which are basically digital assets placed on an encrypted blockchain with unique serial numbers.\nDugdale said that:\nRick Dugdale also stated that the film will be available on the Vuele Marketplace for the first time around the end of July to the beginning of August. Vuele will have four or five \"drops\" of Zero Contact. Dugdale said it will include movies and additional content that has yet to be determined, which will vary from token to token to create different price points.\nFounded in 2019, Vuele is a direct-to-consumer NFT viewing and distribution platform focusing on film distribution and film viewing. Users can purchase content using cryptocurrency or fiat currency.\nThe infiltration of blockchain technology into the traditional media industry, especially encrypted narrative films and television production, seems to be on the rise.\nA few days ago, AMM Global, a film and television production investment company detached from Hong Kong Asia Television Limited (ATV), announced a partnership with Phoenix Waters Productions to launch Asia’s first NFT drama named ‘Crypto Keepers’.\nOn June 15, U.S. media giant Fox Corp announced it was launching a campaign, raising a total of $100M creative fund for its NFT company Blockchain Creative Labs, aimed at inspiring content creators.",

    "content": "A complaint that alleges that Apple’s \"Identifier for Advertisers\"(IDFA) code is a privacy breach and a threat to users has been brought to the attention of Spanish and German cybersecurity authorities.\nThis complaint has been filed by Noyb, a digital rights activist group. The legal complaint is led by Max Schrems, an activist that had previously won successful trials against Facebook in the interest of national data protection. The legal complaint faced by Apple consists of the first major action of its kind faced by the tech company under the European Union (EU)'s jurisdiction.\nThe activist group alleges that the online tracking code pre-installed on iPhones is a violation of the EU’s privacy regulations, as shared by Reuters. Speaking about the matter, Noyb lawyer Stefano Rossetti explained:\nThe IDFA, which is an online tracking code set up on every iPhone, tracks an Apple user’s online behavior in order to provide ads or content tailored to the consumer’s preferences. Applications such as Facebook depend heavily on suggestions like this to roll out targeted ads to attract consumers. Rossetti reiterated that this goes against the European Union’s privacy directives, which stipulate that user consent is required before these installations are allowed on devices.\nHe also said that “tracking must be the rule, not the exception,” as the online tracking tool collects private information on users and stores their data without their consent. This is a direct breach of EU regulations.\nBig Tech scrutinized for its monopoly – Is blockchain the answer?\nThe legal complaint comes in the wake of the antitrust hearing led by the US Congress, in which anti-competitive clauses aimed at regulating the Big Tech – Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (Alphabet) – have been brought up.\nThe US Judiciary Committee has attempted to rein the monopoly these corporate giants are exerting over the tech industry by enforcing certain regulations that will make it fairer for Big Tech’s competitors, namely smaller firms with less bargaining power.\nThe effort of the US Congress to disperse the power exerted by these tech companies begs the question of whether a decentralized platform may be the answer in the future. On blockchain networks, transactions are recorded on the block, are transparent, and can be accessed by anyone leveraging the blockchain, guaranteeing traceability and therefore security.",

    "content": "Exclusive Interview with Yeo Siang Tiong, Kaspersky: Part Two (Link: Part One)\nIn Part Two of our interview, Yeo Siang Tiong, General Manager for Southeast Asia, Kaspersky shared how Kaspersky provides cybersecurity solutions for stock and crypto exchanges to address KYC and AML concerns. He also walked us through the Kaspersky Application Security Assessment and explained its significance in safeguarding assets in crypto exchanges.\nWhat are the main differences in cybersecurity solutions for stock exchanges and crypto exchanges, in terms of KYC and AML?\nThe term “know your customer” originally came from financial services. Banks needed to identify their customers, make sure they didn’t cheat, and be able to check their credit history. In 2017, according to a Thomson Reuters survey, KYC procedures took an average of 32 days, up from 28 days in 2016.\nThe use of digital signatures, once viewed as a possible solution to these problems, cannot obviate the authenticity checks of documents required by KYC procedures. And digital signatures can be forged or stolen.\nTo safeguard businesses from AML schemes, Kaspersky’s Automated Fraud Analytics helps businesses minimize fraud-related costs and reduce the risk of fines for non-compliance from regulating organizations. It adds an extra level of knowledge of industry-specific fraud and money-laundering scenarios, through access to fraud intelligence, combining this knowledge with advanced technologies that automatically detect serious incidents at early stages.\nWith the help of machine learning algorithms, the solution then correlates these findings with the patterns of account takeover, new account fraud, and money laundering, via Kaspersky Fraud Prevention Cloud and global fraud intelligence based on big data. Due to the linking and mapping functionality, the solution can also automatically identify cross-organizational money laundering schemes by looking for correlations between typical profiles, devices used, behavioral patterns and many other details of the sessions that are known to be involved in similar operations.\nCan you walk us through the Kaspersky Application Security Assessment for crypto exchanges? What are the differences between, black-box, grey-box and white-box testing?\nKaspersky’s Application Security Assessment Services uncover vulnerabilities in applications of any kind, from large cloud-based solutions, ERP systems, online banking and other specific business applications, to embedded and mobile applications on different platforms (iOS, Android and others).\nKaspersky Application Security Assessment Services help application owners and developers to:\ni) Avoid financial, operational and reputational loss, by proactively detecting and fixing the vulnerabilities used in attacks against applications\nii) Save remediation costs by tracking down vulnerabilities in applications still in development and test, before they reach the user environment where fixing them may involve considerable disruption and expense.\niii) Support a secure software development lifecycle (S-SDLC) committed to creating and maintaining secure applications.\niv) Comply with government, industry or internal corporate standards covering application security, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA\nApplications assessed can include official web sites and business applications, standard or cloud-based, including embedded and mobile applications. The services are tailored to your needs and application specifics, and may involve:\ni) Black-box testing – emulating an external attacker\nii) Grey-box testing – emulating legitimate users with a range of profiles\niii) White-box testing – analysis with full access to the application, including source codes; this approach is the most effective in terms of revealing numbers of vulnerabilities\nStay tuned for Part 3 of the interview on the latest mining malware for 2020!",

    "summary": "According to the Center for Victim Research, 7-10% of the US population are often victims of identity theft annually. Moreover, 21% of them suffer multiple cases of identity fraud. This menace is being experienced across the globe, and blockchain technology can be instrumental in stamping it out.",
    "content": "The universe has become a global village as the purchase of goods by a click of a button from the comfort of your home or office from different parts of the world has been made available. Due to technological innovations, such as the internet, this has become a reality. Despite the improved convenience and efficiencies, a serious danger of identity theft roams as skilled cybercriminals continue wreaking havoc by stealing our sensitive data online, including credit card information and passwords, to commit fraud or other crimes.\nAccording to the Center for Victim Research, 7-10% of the US population are often victimsof identity theft annually. Moreover, 21% of them suffer multiple cases of identity fraud. This menace is being experienced across the globe, and blockchain technology can be instrumental in stamping it out.\nDistributed ledger technology (DLT) can ensure that your online information is dispensed across associated computer nodes making it immutable as fraudsters cannot be able to alter the data saved.\nBlockchain can eradicate identity theft by:\n1. Guaranteeing ownership of personal information\nCybercriminals have the tendency to leverage on both fictional and real details to develop a whole new identity that they use to apply for credit cards and open bank accounts. This may prove detrimental as you can be left with huge debts. Moreover, terrible credit scores and red flags may be prompted.\nBlockchain seeks to offer incredible solutions as it will guarantee ownership of personal data. For example, if birth certificates are recorded on a blockchain, you will have the mandate of controlling, sharing or validating the details without the urge of a centralized repository.\nIf cybercriminals try to steal the digital identities stored, blockchain will automatically signal the owner of the data. This approach will, therefore, mitigate identity theft.\n2. Boosting weak entry points\nCybercriminals have perfected the art of identifying weak entry points on centralized systems as this enables them to carry out a data breach. For instance, in 2019, nearly 16.7 million people became victims of identity theft in the United States as fraudsters were able to penetrate different systems and commit various crimes.\nBlockchain decentralizes the entire digital infrastructure by using Public Key Cryptography (PKI). Additionally, the information stored is highly encrypted and this eradicates mass data breaches. Blockchain also guarantees secure personal data.\n3. Securing online transactions\nFraudsters only need to steal your credit card number, expiration date together with the CVV number, before purchasing various products on different e-commerce sites. This process is, at times, straight forward to the extent that proper ID verifications are not needed for a transaction to be approved.\nWith the advent of blockchain technology, this is not possible because any transaction is subjected to thorough identity scrutiny based on the encrypted data.\nBottom Line\nAccording to Identity Force, there is a new victimof identity theft every 2 seconds. This rate is alarming, and this is the reason why stringent measures are necessitated to curb this menace. Blockchain technology has presented itself as an ideal solution based on its distributed ledger technology (DLT) as it will guarantee ownership of personal data, boost weak entry points, and secure online transactions.",

    "summary": "Metis is launching the Liquid Staking Blitz, a decentralized sequencer initiative, to boost the growth of Liquid Staking Derivatives within its ecosystem, enhancing network security and governance.",
    "content": "Metis is making a leap in the Ethereum Layer 2 space with its Liquid Staking Blitz (LSB) and the development of a Decentralized Sequencer. The LSB initiative is designed to accelerate the growth of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) and LSD-focused products within the Metis ecosystem. By leveraging the 4.6M METIS Ecosystem Development Fund, Metis aims to foster innovation and broaden participation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. This is particularly noteworthy as it represents a pioneering move towards unlocking the liquidity of staked assets on a Layer 2 network, offering enhanced security, versatility, and the potential for broad user adoption.\nThe Metis Decentralized Sequencer marks a transformative step towards decentralization in the Layer 2 rollup space. Unlike traditional single-sequencer models that pose centralization and security risks, Metis's approach involves community testing of a Proof-of-Stake Sequencer Pool, set to officially launch on the mainnet later in 2024. This development aims to enhance network security, censorship resistance, and community governance participation, setting a new standard for Layer 2 rollup architecture.\nFurthermore, Metis's strategy includes significant community involvement in its governance structure, ensuring that the decision-making process regarding funding, network enhancements, and collaborations is democratized and community-driven. The introduction of a native liquid staking protocol for METIS tokens expands the platform's capabilities, promising an inclusive and participatory blockchain ecosystem.\nOverall, Metis's initiatives like the LSB and the decentralized sequencer pool not only aim to improve liquidity and innovation within its ecosystem but also reflect a broader commitment to advancing the Ethereum network's scalability and decentralization. This could potentially set a precedent for other Layer 2 solutions and play a crucial role in shaping the future of Ethereum's Layer 2 landscape.",

    "content": "Key Takeaways\nSFC's Dual Role in Asset Management\nChristina Choi, Executive Director of Investment Products at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), addressed the Bloomberg Buy-Side Forum in Hong Kong on September 26, 2023. She outlined the SFC's dual role: protecting investors and upholding market integrity, and strengthening Hong Kong's position as a global asset management hub. The SFC aims to balance regulation and innovation, ensuring that technology advancements like AI and blockchain can be integrated into the asset management industry without compromising market integrity.\nTechnology's Impact on Asset Management\nChoi highlighted the rapid advancements in technology, specifically mentioning the miniaturization of chip technology from 90 nanometres to just three nanometres in two decades. She linked these technological leaps to the potential for \"tiny changes\" in the asset management industry that could result in significant market development.\nTokenization of Retail Investment Products\nOne of the most notable points in Choi's speech was the discussion on tokenization of SFC-authorized investment products. Tokenization refers to the use of blockchain technology to create digital tokens that represent fractional ownership in an investment product. Choi mentioned that the SFC is currently working on detailed guidelines for tokenization, particularly focusing on primary dealing at this stage due to the nascent state of Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs) in Hong Kong.\nRegulation Enables Innovation\nChoi stressed that while innovation is crucial, it must be balanced with robust regulation to ensure sustainable development and investor protection. She cited historical examples like the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08 and the fallout of unregulated crypto platforms to emphasize the importance of regulation.\nClosing Remarks\nIn her closing remarks, Choi drew an analogy between regulation and machine learning, stating that just as \"machine learning without regularization\" is problematic, so is \"innovation without regulation.\"",

    "content": "In the latest crypto news, Google has expanded its Web3 program by adding 11 blockchain partners to its Google for Startups Cloud Program. The program will provide expertise, grants, and services to emerging Web3 entrepreneurs. The UK government has also allocated $125 million to establish an AI task force aimed at promoting the country's sovereign capabilities, such as public services, and fostering the adoption of safe and reliable AI foundation models. On the other hand, FTX has agreed to sell its LedgerX futures and options exchange and clearinghouse to M7 Holdings for $50 million, while Binance.US has backed out of its $1 billion Voyager asset purchase due to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\nIn more detail, Google has partnered with 11 Web3 blockchain firms, such as Alchemy, Polygon, Celo, and Hedera, to expand its Google for Startups Cloud Program. As part of the program, pre-seed Web3 startups can receive up to $2,000 in Google Cloud credits valid for two years, while seeded startups can access $200,000 over two years for Google Cloud and Firebase usage. Additionally, blockchain partners are offering grants of up to $3 million to seeded companies in the program. Nansen, a blockchain analytics company, has also partnered with Google Cloud to provide real-time blockchain data for startups.\nMeanwhile, the UK government has launched an AI task force to accelerate the country's readiness for AI. The task force will focus on promoting sovereign capabilities, such as public services, and fostering the adoption of safe and reliable AI foundation models. The task force aims to launch its first pilots of AI usage and integration targeting public services in the next six months. The UK is committed to becoming a science and technology superpower by 2030 and is pushing for \"safe AI\" that regulates technology to \"keep people safe\" without limiting innovation.\nIn terms of cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX has agreed to sell its LedgerX futures and options exchange and clearinghouse to M7 Holdings for $50 million. The deal is subject to approval from the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, which is scheduled to hear the case on May 4. FTX purchased LedgerX in August 2021 to expand its spot trading services, and the sale is part of FTX's efforts to monetize assets and deliver recoveries to stakeholders.\nOn the other hand, Binance.US has backed out of its agreement to purchase bankrupt cryptocurrency brokerage Voyager Digital's assets for $1 billion, citing the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\" The Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors expressed its disappointment at the news and said it was investigating potential claims against Binance.US. Voyager and the creditors' committee will now work on distributing cash and crypto to customers directly via the Voyager platform.\nIn conclusion, the crypto world has seen significant developments this week, from Google expanding its Web3 program to the UK government allocating funding for an AI task force. FTX is set to sell LedgerX, and Binance.US backs out of the Voyager asset purchase. The industry remains dynamic and unpredictable, with companies and governments adapting to the ever-changing regulatory environment.",

    "summary": "Ethereum developers have finally achieved a successful testnet release with Zinken.",
    "content": "After having suffered from low validator participation on the last “dress rehearsal” they launched in preparation for Ethereum 2.0 blockchain, Ethereum developers have finally achieved a successful testnet release with Zinken.\nSpadina testnet fails, enter Zinken\nZinken, another short-term rehearsal testnet launch by developers to prepare for the official release of Ethereum 2.0 mainnet’s Phase 0, has proven to be successful, unlike its precedent Spadina. The goal of Zinken is mainly for developers and stakers to practice the genesis process.\nSince genesis is considered “a risky and difficult part of the process,” the Ethereum team have set up a few testnets in parallel with Medalla in order for validators to practice before Ethereum 2.0 mainnet was released and there was real Ether (ETH) at stake, so to speak.\nZinken’s launch was reported to have been smooth sailing, with enough participation to keep the chain running. In addition, no major bugs were observed.\nZinken testnet proves to be successful\nUnlike Spadina and Medalla when both were first launched, Zinken did not suffer from low participation rates, which are generally due to validators who signed up for the testnet failing to bring their clients online. Zinken is the first testnet to have achieved the finality threshold within a few minutes of its release, making it the most successful “launch rehearsal” for the team so far.\nMaintaining a high participation rate during testnet launches is crucial to the health of the blockchain. For the network to run smoothly, at least 66% of the blocks need to be confirmed for finality to be achieved. With Zinken, though participation rates still did not hit an ideal standard of 90%, it was still recorded to be above 75%, making Ethereum developers optimistic about the anticipated 2020 launch of Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was also present during the launch of Zinken, and he announced that his team might still hold a few more testnet rehearsals, but they would likely exclusively be reserved for Ethereum developers.\nWhat to expect from Phase 0 of ETH 2.0 mainnet\nEthereum 2.0 mainnet will be launched in different steps so that the blockchain could be broken down and perfected to the last details. The first step, Phase 0, will feature a beacon chain, which is the first building block for the new mainnet.\nThe current Ethereum 1.0 blockchain will operate in parallel with Ethereum 2.0. On the new main chain, which is to run on a pure Proof-of-Stake protocol, the Ether (ETH) that stakers input will be locked in. Transfers and withdrawals will not be possible until other phases of the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain are launched.\nSpeaking about his team’s anticipation of the first phase of Ethereum 2.0 being launched in 2020, Ethereum Foundation’s lead coordinator Danny Ryan said his team was on track for the 2020 launch of Ethereum mainnet, even if there were still a few things to be perfected through testnets like Zinken. He said:\nWhat about high Ethereum gas fees?\nIn a live stream for Zinken’s launch, an Ethereum developer asked Buterin “whether transaction fees on Ethereum are once again going to fall so low that it would onboard the unbanked, or bank the unbanked, with solutions like layer 2 and sharding coming up.” He asked if he thought layer 2 solutions and sharding was going to help bank the unbanked.\nTo which Buterin replied:",

    "content": "Crypto tax on digital assets in South Korea will be delayed by another two years, according to an announcement from the Ministry of Economy and Finance tax policy chief Ko Kwang-hyo.\nOriginally the 20% tax on crypto-asset gains was dated to kick off from January 1, 2023. However, following the announcement, the date has been moved to January 2025.\nKo’s announcement is part of President Yoon Suk-yeol’s new administrative-economic policy roadmap. Yoon had voiced out that a crypto tax should be introduced after preparing sufficient market infrastructure.\nThe roadmap reads that the upcoming “Digital Assets Basic Act” will focus on regulating the issuance and listing of cryptocurrencies.\nJanuary 1, 2023, was initially planned for 2022, but the date had to be moved due to heavy backlash from investors.\nInvestors argued that the crypto tax would heavily impact the nascent crypto industry. They said that the threshold was low, considering a tax plan for the stock market would kick in on capital gains above 50 million KRW (US$39,475.76).\nAlong with the crypto tax, a 20% tax on capital gains above 50 million Korean won (US$38,624.95) from stock trading has also been postponed to 2025. The original kickoff date was January 2023.\nAccording to a recent report from Blockchain.News, Layer-1 blockchain protocol Solana, through its subsidiaries Solana Ventures and Solana Foundation, has launched a $100 million fund to back startups in the South Korea Web3.0 ecosystem.\nAs reported by TechCrunch, drawing on the exclusive interview with Johnny Lee, general manager of games at Solana Labs, the fund will focus exclusively on GameFi, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in South Korea.\n“A big portion of Korea’s gaming industry is moving into web3,” Lee said. “We want to be flexible; there’s a wide range of project sizes, team sizes, so some of [our investments] will be venture-sized checks.”\nThe investment into the South Korean Web3.0 ecosystem is a testament to the growing acclaim in the growth of developers introducing a series of Web3.0 initiatives in the country.\nDespite attaining undue popularity as the host nation of Do Kwon’s collapsed Terra protocol, Solana has looked beyond the woes to throw its weight behind the industry’s growth.",

We are deeply sorry,\" the DeFi platform stated.\nThe DEX aggregator said it is working with cybersecurity specialists such as SlowMist, PeckShield, Bitrace, and TokenPocket security and technical teams to track down the hacker and recover the funds.\nTransit Swap said a bug in the code allowed a hacker to run away with an estimated $21 million. PeckShield, a blockchain security company, gave a further explanation that the attack might have occurred due to a compatibility issue or misplaced trust in the swap contract.\nAccording to Chainalysis, the total revenue for crypto crime in the first half of this year stood at $1.6 billion, less than the figure recorded in the first half of 2021. The drop in crypto crime figures has coincided with a fall in crypto values. However, some forms of crypto-crime have risen in the last year, such as the value of hacked crypto assets has increased from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion.\nWhile Bloomberg reported that about $2 billion has been lost in crypto hacks this year. Many of those hacks were perpetrated by North Korea-linked groups, and cross-chain bridges used to transfer tokens across blockchains have been a popular target.\nThe Binance hack has shown that even though the Binance ecosystem is among the highest profile, it can still be buffeted.\nZhao said on Twitter that \"in all likelihood, Binance will cover any fund that the hackers get away with.\"\nBNB fell as much as 3.3% on Friday and was trading around $285 as of 10:08 am in Tokyo.",

In addition to that, a technology working paper that delves into the technical as well as economic design issues was published.\nCBDCs such as the digital pound may co-exist in what the authors of the article believe to be a \"mixed payments economy,\" despite the increase of privately-issued stablecoins over the last few years, according to the findings of the paper.\n\"The digital pound does not need to be the predominate form of money in order to accomplish its public policy aims in the same way that cash coexists alongside private money. It is possible that the digital pound will coexist with other types of currency, such as stablecoins.\nAlthough the Bank of England (BoE) and the Treasury Department (Treasury) have expressed optimism that a digital version of the pound would be introduced by 2025 \"at the earliest,\" they are not yet one hundred percent positive that this will really occur.\nAccording to the report, \"The Bank and HM Treasury assess it is likely to be necessary in the UK to have a digital pound,\" however there is currently no decision that can be made to adopt such a currency.\nAccording to the paper, the primary objective behind the launch of the digital pound is to \"promote innovation, choice, and efficiency in domestic payments\" and to ensure that the money issued by the central bank of the United Kingdom continues to serve as \"an anchor for confidence and safety\" in the monetary system of the country.\n\"For the digital pound to play the role that cash plays in anchoring the monetary system, it needs to be usable and sufficient adopted by households and businesses,\" this quote from the Financial Times reads. \"For the digital pound to play the role that cash plays in anchoring the monetary system, it needs to be usable and sufficient adopted by households and businesses.\"\nUsers will have access to e-GBP after they have established a connection to an API that is managed by the private sector and that, in turn, links to the core ledger.\nAdditional programmability capabilities, including as smart contracts and atomic swaps, which make it possible for assets to be moved across networks, will be made available.",

    "content": "Mastercard, in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC), has unveiled a pioneering solution that fosters the interoperability of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) across diverse blockchain networks, aiming to bolster Web3 commerce both within Australia and globally.\nThe venture represents a significant stride towards the harmonization of CBDCs with various blockchain ecosystems, ensuring their utilization by authorized entities in a secure manner. The technology demonstrated by Mastercard allows CBDCs to be tokenized, or \"wrapped,\" onto different blockchains, thereby expanding consumers' ability to engage in commerce across multiple blockchain platforms securely and effortlessly. This initiative is part of a broader RBA and DFCRC project to explore the possible applications of a CBDC in Australia.\nA notable aspect of this endeavor was a live demonstration where a holder of a pilot CBDC could purchase a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) listed on the Ethereum public blockchain. The process entailed the \"locking\" of the requisite amount of the pilot CBDC on the RBA’s pilot CBDC platform, followed by the minting of an equivalent amount of wrapped pilot CBDC tokens on Ethereum. It was imperative that the Ethereum wallets of both the buyer and seller, along with the NFT marketplace smart contract, were 'allow-listed' within the platform, showcasing the platform's capacity to enforce controls, even on public blockchains.\nThe pilot leverages Mastercard's Multi Token Network, introduced in June 2023, which provides a set of fundamental capabilities aimed at enabling more efficient payment and commerce applications using blockchain technology. By facilitating easy on-demand movement of digital currencies via Mastercard’s trusted network, more consumers could partake in crypto ecosystems using reliable forms of money, while reaping the benefits such as programmability and transparency that these currencies offer.\nNotably, the interoperability between blockchains as demonstrated in this project could unlock new avenues of collaboration between public and private networks, thereby driving impactful advancements in the digital currency domain. Furthermore, the broader utilization of blockchain technology across various payments use cases aligns with Mastercard's strategy to extend the functionality available in digital assets to regulated entities.\nThe participation of entities like Mintable and Cuscal in this pilot, alongside Mastercard, signals a progressive stance towards exploring innovative digital currency applications, potentially revolutionizing commerce, fraud prevention, and documentation processes",

    "summary": "Ethereum developers have launched a short-term testnet, dubbed Spadina, in preparation for Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.",
    "content": "Just when the Ethereum community thought that Medalla was going to be the last testnet before Ethereum 2.0 mainnet's official release, developers have unveiled yet another.\nEthereum developers have once again launched another testnet, bringing them one step closer to replacing the current Ethereum public mainnet with a new blockchain that will operate based on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol.\nSpadina, a rehearsal launch for Ethereum 2.0\nSpadina, the newest addition to the string of testnets developers have unveiled in preparation for Ethereum 2.0’s Phase 0, is said to be a short “dress rehearsal” for validators before the mainnet launch. Released on September 29, Spadina testnet will only be active for 72 hours, and the network will operate in parallel with Medalla, the multi-client testnet that Ethereum launched at the beginning of August.\nThe main focus for developers and Ether stakers on Spadina is to practice their deposit and genesis chops before Ethereum 2.0. Speaking on behalf of the Ethereum ecosystem, mainnet lead researcher Danny Ryan said:\nJust like Medalla testnet, the main problem that occurred with Spadina’s launch was that there were lower participation rates than expected. The first round of validators was reported to be below 35%, with the target for participation levels set at 80%.\nHowever, developers have affirmed that this was nothing to worry about, as the low participation levels are maybe due to the fact that no real Ether is “at stake,” since Medalla and Spadina are a chance for validators and for the community to practice staking in anticipation of the future chain.\nDespite the slight drawback, it has been announced that Ethereum developers were quite happy with the outcome of Spadina’s launch, as blocks were handled successfully by the clients in the deposit process. According to Ryan, Spadina testnet’s launch was “90% successful.”\nWhen Ethereum 2.0 mainnet launches, the issue of offline stakers will likely not be a problem anymore, as real ETH will be running on the chain.\nEthereum 2.0 mainnet\nEthereum 2.0 will be launched in three phases so that during each stage, different aspects could be focused on to achieve a highly scalable and healthy blockchain.\nThe future mainnet will be an upgrade and a replacement of the current Ethereum blockchain, as developers are actively working on making the necessary adjustments to transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain.\nAlthough an official launch date has not been set, Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0 is predicted to be in effect before the end of 2020, as disclosed by one of the top client teams staking on Ethereum testnet.\nRecently, with most decentralized finance(DeFi) protocols running on its chain, Ethereum's transaction fees reached new highs, with gas prices hitting 700 gwei. On average, gwei prices are supposed to be around 416. The issue of scalability will need to be addressed and upgraded with ETH 2.0, which is said to increase transaction processing on Ethereum from 15 transactions per second to approximately 100,000 transactions per second.",

    "content": "Polkadot has caught widespread attention among blockchain project investors recently. Founded by Ethereum Co-founder Gavin Wood and managed by Web3 Foundation, Polkadot recently completed its private token sale with 500,000 DOT tokens at the valuation of $1.2 bn.\nClaimed as the candidate of Decentralized Web 3.0 Blockchain interoperability platform, what makes Polkadot so popular? We are glad to speak with Jack Platts, Head of Collaborations of Web3 Foundation to share with us how Polkadot is interoperable with Bitcoin! He also explains the GRANDPA protocol of Polkadot and how Polkadot can interact with Ethereum!\nTo start off, can you briefly introduce Polkadot to our readers?\nPolkadot attempts to abstract away security and interoperability so that a higher level, user-facing applications can focus on building products. We think of Polkadot as an infrastructure for infrastructure. Polkadot is developer-facing, and kind of handles the connection between many disparate blockchains, economies, and markets. You can think of it like the UN or the United States Federal Government, where the countries or states contribute but ultimately have their own fiefdoms and control over how their citizens live.\nTalking about Polkadot, the project of Web 3 Foundation. Can you elaborate on what is GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) consensus?\nGRANDPA is the finality gadget used in Polkadot. It’s also a Substrate Runtime Module so anyone building a blockchain, whether for Polkadot or not, can use it too. The research team at Web3 Foundation created GRANDPA so that Polkadot could be scalable and secure. Rob Habermeier wrote a great blog post on the intricacies of GRANDPA and Alistair Stewart wrote a more technical paper for anyone interested. I’d encourage folks interested in consensus to check those out, as well as our Wiki.\nPolkadot claims that it allows interaction with smart contracts in Ethereum. Can you elaborate on this can be done?\nWeb3 Foundation is providing grants to teams building bridges. One of the first bridges will be to Ethereum, but it’s important to note that Polkadot is not a smart contracts platform. It’s a networking protocol, a kind of trade a security agreement between blockchains. So by bridging in Ethereum, and having native parachains that provide smart contracts like Edgeware, all other blockchains connected to Polkadot can use smart contracts and the state of those contracts, too.\nHow to achieve interoperability between Polkadot and Bitcoin?\nThis would be done via a bridge chain. Polkadot can connect any previously existing blockchain if it matches two criteria:\nBitcoin and Bitcoin-like chains fall short on these characteristics. To address the first criteria, Polkadot validators can simply run a full Bitcoin node. To address the second criteria, either a soft-fork allowing extra-protocol controls over funds or a hard-fork enabling a threshold-signature-friendly signing scheme such as Schnorr is needed. Neither are impossible goals, however, a significant degree coordination would be required to achieve them.",

It refers to a shared virtual world where users can socialise, play games, live as an avatar and try out the latest fashion from their couch. Users buy these virtual items using cryptocurrency that are backed by NFTs or other digital assets.\nIn the Sandbox, investors can also buy properties and develop their assets much like in the real world where users can buy their games and items from. The Sandbox has also been fueling the recent growth of virtual real-estate demand having partnered with major IPs and brands.\nSpeaking through a statement from Cheng's office, Adrian’s LAND will be one of the biggest plots in The Sandbox. His plot will also form part of the ‘Mega City’ virtual world, which will include Adrian’s Innovation Hub, where successful start-ups that he personally supported from the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China Guangdong Province, will have a space to sell their products via the GBA Pavilion.\nGBA start-ups to be featured in Adrian’s Innovation Hub include Aesir, Casetify, Lalamove, DayDayCook, Prenetics, Raspect, Rice Robotics, Rooftop Republic, Undone and V Cycle.\nThe statement also said that the GBA Pavilion will inspire and encourage entrepreneurs and the featured companies will offer entertainment, exclusive NFTs and immersive experiences.\nYat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, commented: “Adrian is one of the most influential leaders in business, real estate, arts and culture in Hong Kong and the region, and we are thrilled that he is joining The Sandbox to bring his unique perspective and to help add and shape new transformative experiences to the open metaverse.”\nAn alternative way to invest in property\nCostly housing price has become a challenging issue among the local Hong Kong residents, compared to other major countries and regions worldwide. Although prices slipped 0.4 per cent to 396.3 in September, according to an index by the Rating and Valuation Department, for many residents investing in property is still sky-high. Owning property has been described as a mission impossible. In light of that situation, virtual assets have propped up for many to explore.\nIn this new opportunity, Hong Kong residents can create immersive 3D worlds and game experiences and safely store, trade, and monetize their creations in The Sandbox Metaverse's decentralized and intuitive platform.\nCurrently, around a third of Hong Kong residents have invested in, or used, cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, the second-highest engagement with the new asset class among developed markets surveyed by credit card company Visa, according to local media South China Morning Post reported.",

    "content": "The Stellar (XLM) Development Foundation (SDF) has decided to postpone the vote on Protocol 20, initially scheduled for January 30, due to a bug discovered in Stellar Core v20.1.0. This decision came after the SDF received feedback from various participants in the Stellar ecosystem, including contract developers, wallet developers, validators, and tools builders.\nThe bug, identified on January 25, 2024, affects fee-bump transactions for Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. It could potentially impact applications and services that use fee bumps for Soroban transactions if the Mainnet upgrades to Protocol 20. While the SDF initially assessed the risk posed by the bug as minimal, they later decided to delay the upgrade in response to the ecosystem's feedback and the need for a broad consensus.\nThe SDF has \"disarmed\" its validators to prevent them from voting for the upgrade on the planned date. However, it's important to note that the decision to upgrade does not solely rest with the SDF. Other validators on the Stellar network may still choose to vote for the Protocol 20 upgrade on the scheduled date. A quorum is required by the voting validators for the Protocol 20 upgrade to pass.\nProtocol 20 is a significant upgrade for the Stellar network, aiming to introduce smart contract functionality through a phased rollout of the Soroban platform, which is a smart contract platform that went live on a Stellar testnet in October 2022. The SDF also launched a $100 million fund to attract developers to the platform at that time.\nThe SDF plans to coordinate with validators to determine a new upgrade date once a new version of Stellar Core containing the bug fix is available, which is expected within the next two weeks. The Stellar blockchain currently hosts over 40 validator nodes, and a validator quorum will be required for any future upgrade proposal.\nThis delay is a careful step by the SDF to ensure the stability and reliability of the Stellar network as it introduces significant protocol changes. The commitment to involving the community and validators in these decisions highlights the collaborative nature of blockchain governance.",

    "content": "Dubai, UAE | October 26th, 2022 — BlazeSwap is an upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) launching on Flare Network, the new blockchain that aims to connect everything. BlazeSwap will be the first and only DEX on Flare offering users Flare’s price oracle delegation and network airdrop rewards on top of liquidity provider fees. BlazeSwap pools uniquely offer automatic delegation to data providers for Flare’s native decentralized price oracle, the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO). FTSO delegation is similar to staking but merit-based, where network rewards are distributed to the most reliable FTSO price providers and the token holders who actively delegate to them. BlazeSwap incorporates this Flare-native feature, offering an enhanced earning structure that augments traditional DEX Liquidity Provider incentives from pool trading fees with the organic FTSO rewards. Thanks to BlazeSwap, FLR holders can maximize utility from participating in the DEX, providing liquidity while improving the security of the network. BlazeSwap is expected to go live on Flare once the blockchain exits observation mode. If Flare Improvement Proposal 01, FIP.01, is accepted by the community, then contributors to BlazeSwap’s liquidity pools will also be able to receive their share of the delegation incentive pool token rewards, in addition to the regular inflationary rewards for delegating to the FTSO. BlazeSwap has been audited by Omniscia, and is based on the same Automated Market Maker (AMM) model made popular by Uniswap V2. As Flare’s bridging applications are launched - including FAssets for legacy tokens like BTC, XRP DOGE and Layer Cake for smart contract networks - additional tokens will become available for swapping and liquidity provision on BlazeSwap. With Flare as the cross-chain hub, BlazeSwap becomes a market where users can tap into the most important Web3 tokens from one platform.\nHugo Philion, Flare CEO & Co-founder said, “We are thrilled to see Blazeswap integrating Flare’s native data infrastructure to offer a new way of doing DeFi. This is exciting news, not only for BlazeSwap and Flare, but also the broader Web3 and DeFi communities. We look forward to seeing what other innovative products our growing developer base will be able to build using Flare’s native protocols.\nAlex Dupre, BlazeSwap Founder: After months of development we've been very happy to see the enthusiasm from Flare's community about the launch of the alpha version of BlazeSwap on the Coston testnet. The speed of the Flare network, its low gas fees and its goal to \"connect everything\" make it a perfect match with our decentralized exchange. Its full integration with Flare's native components is what the community has been waiting for, in order to demonstrate and fully unlock the network’s potential. We'll soon be announcing a bug bounty program to further strengthen the security of our platform. We are now eager to roll out the final version of the smart contracts on Songbird, and later on Flare, and to continue working on the user interface and third party integrations, listening to the feedback from our awesome user base.\nAbout Flare\nFlare is a new blockchain built to connect everything. It presents developers with a single, simple, coherent stack to build applications that are fully cross-chain capable. Flare’s protocols will provide (1) scalable EVM-based smart contracts; (2) truly decentralized price feeds; (3) secure state acquisition from other blockchains via the first consensus protocol for external data; (4) insured smart contract token bridging; (5) non-smart contract token bridging; (6) secured data relay; (7) horizontal scaling through a fully interoperable multi-chain ecosystem. This will allow developers to serve multiple communities and ecosystems simultaneously through a single deployment on Flare.\nAbout BlazeSwap BlazeSwap is the first open-source, fully decentralized exchange on the Flare Network. Developed by the same team behind A-FTSO, it aims to become the best and cheapest place to swap and earn fees from all tokens on the Flare network. Supplying to BlazeSwap allows FLR token holders to receive full FTSO rewards from inflation and FIP.01 (should it pass), avoiding the dilemma of staking versus providing liquidity in pools.",

    "content": "Paxful, the peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace, has released a survey that indicates India’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin has been reignited following the landmark decision to lift the ban on crypto trading.\nPaxful, conducted a survey around the future potential of cryptocurrency in India. The survey finding have highlighted which industries are most primed for adoption, as well as uncovered the feelings of Indian citizens,aged 18 - 55, towards crypto and bitcoin.\nPrior to the Indian Supreme Court’s reversal of the ban on digital assets, Paxful data showed Indian sentiment around digital currencies did not reflected the concerns of their government.\nIn January, Paxful has recorded over $3 million in trade volume in India.\nAccording to the March survey, 93.8% of respondents invested in crypto prior to lifting the ban in 2020, with 90% holding Bitcoin and 44% holding Ether.\nThe Survey found that prior to the ban lift, almost 94% of the respondents had already invested in crypto with the majority holding BTC and about half holding Ether. An interesting finding was that of the 75% of respondents that claim to rely on crypto for money remittance cited the need to bypass a corrupt banking system.\nPer the report, “The future of cryptocurrency in India looks bright, and the survey respondents agree with 43.40% stating that they look forward to an increase in jobs and the ability to take on entrepreneurial endeavors. It is expected that cryptocurrency usage will continue to flourish, a conclusion that can be based on the statistic that 40.40% of respondents would invest in digital currency over any other investment option with stocks and bonds to follow (30.00%) and real estate and gold coming in at 14%.”\nR3's Marco Polo Network Sees India As Key Area for Growth\nAs reported by Blockchain.News on March 27, The Marco Polo Network announced on Thursday that India’s leading provider of digital transformation, Tech Mahindra became the first corporate in India to join the R3’s open-source blockchain-based Marco Polo Network for facilitating cross-border transactions.\nWith this new partnership, Tech Mahindra carried out several digitized trade finance transactions, facilitated by its partnering bank DBS Bank, utilizing Marco Polo’s Receivables Discounting tool. This tool is a solution that enables effective management of working capital, enhances liquidity and reduces any risks associated with credit.\nRob Barnes, CEO of the Marco Polo Network and TradeIX, the company behind the Marco Polo Network highlighted that the decision behind bringing an Indian company onboard was due to the fact that “Asia serves as a key area of growth for the Marco Polo Network.”\n“We are in extremely difficult and challenging times now, with facilitating trade and minimizing supply chain disruptions becoming even more important now than ever,” stated Barnes. “This is a great achievement with two leading institutions with more collaborations planned in the near future.”",

    "summary": "JPMorgan published a report showing a significant move towards blockchain, enormous growth of blockchain, and challenges hindering mainstream adoption.",
    "content": "US banking giant JP Morgan has recently published a report that describes the current blockchain developments as laying the groundwork for digital money. The 74-page report indicates many projects that have demonstrated “real world” case uses for blockchain in finance and hence recognizes 2019 as the year being remembered for the “rise of digital money.” The New York-based bank highlighted several of the most promising applications that it sees as having the potential for widespread adoption within the financial sector.\nMainstream blockchain adoption\nThe emergence of blockchain has enabled cryptocurrencies to exist and also transformed consumer preferences in terms of modernizing payments for the on-demand world. Real-world projects that broken traditional barriers in business include equity trades, which now are being settled on blockchain and also blockchain facilitating cross-border payments with digital assets.\nMany famous brands like Facebook, with its Libra stablecoin and JP Morgan, with its JPM coin, have taken research and investment in blockchain technology.\nGovernments are also making a move to adopt blockchain. For instance, China is creating its own digital currency, and Great Britain’s Bank of England also announced its research into developing a digital currency. Six major central banks around the world have also been reported to be working together to gain a better understanding of central bank digital currencies.\nThe paper indicates that the crypto market is showing signs of maturity, like increasing institutional participation and the establishment of new contracts on regulated exchanges. The report acknowledges that the foundation for mainstream adoption of blockchain, digital currencies, and fast payments already is in place. Although blockchain has seen more extensive use among firms such as stock exchanges, banks, and others, mainstream adoption is still years away.\nThe report read, “Widespread adoption of blockchain with scalable solutions is at least three to five years away. Technical challenges like cross-platform integration and challenges associated with the regulatory and legal framework and macro-economic environment could decelerate further progress.”\nBlockchain is promising for corporations and banks if they can find out how to use it properly. By combining many companies or users on one ledger or blockchain, transactions can be performed in real-time with certainty, something that proponents say that will generate millions of dollars in savings. However, several challenges still remain. Most corporate efforts still are in early development or testing. Technological issues like scaling and slow networks must be addressed. Moreover, regulatory agencies across the globe have been less than clear regarding how they view the development of new digital assets.\nJPMorgan has been a pioneer in blockchain and crypto-asset development. In a time when wary banks were choking off digital currencies, JPMorgan launched its own private dollar-backed cryptocurrency for payment. The company launched its own permissioned ledger, Quorum, in 2019, and since then, the ledger has settled transactions worth millions of dollars. The firm continues pursuing innovative digital solutions in the financial industry. Through its research on digital currencies, JPMorgan continues leading the way for various banks to adopt blockchain.",

It will provide decentralized identity, trusted storage, private ownership, and decentralized messaging for Nimble community members on the Algorand blockchain. Both parties are enthusiastic about this collaboration as it will help DeFi investors have something to fall back on in case of hacks or private key misplacement.\nNimble is a global decentralized insurance company deploying Web3.0 and blockchain tools and technology to power the community-centric future of efficient and equitable insurance processes.\nMeanwhile, Verida is a network of personal data owned and collected by users, incentivizing them to unlock their data stored on centralized platforms.\nA threat or hack could lead to the loss of millions of cryptocurrencies locked in a smart contract. Similarly, a misplacement or hack of a crypto wallet could lead to a loss of all assets in the wallet. These are unforeseen circumstances that could be experienced in the crypto world as investors aim to make a fortune in the crypto market.\nThe decentralized finance ecosystem currently valued at $96 billion is a crypto niche with lots of uncertainties and rewards. In 2021, the DeFi industry recorded around $10 billion, which was lost due to the hacks of various smart contracts. This alone is one factor that hinders the widespread adoption of decentralized finance, as most investors are scared of losing their hard-earned assets to hackers.\nTo curtail this, DeFi insurance was implemented to buy coverage against losses caused by uncertainties in the DeFi industry.",

This is because the vulnerability has been exploited.\nOn February 21, the Hope Finance Twitter account warned clients about the fraud, which prompted the Web3 security company CertiK to raise the alarm about the situation.\nIt is quite challenging to get any information on the project. A Twitter account for the platform was established in January of 2023, and on that account, information was published on the network's plans to build an algorithmic stablecoin that would be dubbed Hope token. This information was provided on the Twitter account (HOPE). The amount of Ether that is now being exchanged for one unit of HOPE causes real-time modifications to be made to the supply of the HOPE coin (ETH).\n\"It would seem that the con artist modified with the TradingHelper contract, which meant that the money were delivered to the con artist every time 0x4481 called OpenTrade on the GenesisRewardPool.\" This includes the erroneous application of a modifier as well as the potential of reentrancy attacks. Cognitos discovered that the smart contract code was still able to pass the audit with flying colors, despite the fact that these vulnerabilities had been identified and pointed out.\nAs a reaction to the fraudulent behavior, Hope Finance disseminated information to its users, which provided them with the possibility to remove staked currency from the protocol by making use of an emergency withdrawal option.\nArbitrum is a roll-up network that was built on top of Ethereum's layer 2 and has the potential to enable smart contracts to expand in an exponential form. This potential was discovered when the network's creators saw that Ethereum's layer 2 was lacking in roll-up capabilities.\nOptimism and the other layer-2 protocols are continue to deal with an ever-increasing amount of transactions inside the Ethereum ecosystem. The ability to maintain a positive outlook is one of these protective strategies.",

    "content": "The first generation of play-to-earn blockchain games has sparked global excitement. But unfortunately, one can't turn a blind eye to their glaring weaknesses and oversights either. For example, building a sustainable game requires a substantial focus on story, artwork, and content rather than monetization. The Monetization Mindset Is Counterproductive\nThere is much to like about play-to-earn games and their opportunities. Giving players the ability to own in-game assets and convert them to real money is appealing. Unfortunately, most of these games are also pay-to-lay, as gamers need one or multiple NFTs before they can explore the virtual world. Making an upfront investment - often worth hundreds of dollars - creates a very problematic mindset among players.\nRather than enjoying the game to its fullest, players will try to recuperate that initial investment. As such, they will collect in-game rewards and sell them for money as fast as possible. That approach has created unsustainable in-game economies, affecting titles like Axie Infinity. Its native assets, AXS and SLP, are in the dirt and continue to lose value. There isn't sufficient demand for these currencies, and the overall supply keeps growing too quickly.\nHowever, developers also won't shy away from taking shortcuts. They often know their players will focus on monetization rather than story or artwork. As a result, they spend less time focusing on those elements and only build game worlds with changing backgrounds, mechanics that grow stale, and repetitive content. In most cases, there is no open \"living\" world to explore, which is not what gaming should be about.\nGetting to the market faster than competing games is essential. However, that speedy approach should never compromise storytelling, artwork, or engaging content. P2E Game developers need to rid themselves of the monetization mindset and look beyond how they can make money from players quickly. Building Games Takes Time\nVideo games are an art form that combines many different media types, including writing, illustration, and music. As a result, building a video game's narrative and artwork can take an extraordinary amount of time. Moreover, it is a process that shouldn't be rushed, especially not in favor of making a quick buck.\nThe writer(s) must first develop an original plot, which can be based on a pre-existing idea from another source. They then must figure out how to make this story fit into the game's world. That process may seem straightforward, but it rarely is. Translating a book or movie to a game - or vice versa - often fails when the project is rushed due to ulterior - and greedy - motives.\nOnce the basic plot is established, artists must create concept art for each scene in the game. They must also design characters, scenery, and other elements the team will use in the finished product. Creativity is not a switch one can flip on or off, though. There are days when the muse flows and other days when the creative part of the brain is as barren as a wasteland.\nFinally, developers spend several months working on programming code for every game aspect. That code then goes through rigorous testing internally. Most games will also provide alpha and beta testing to the public to ensure everything works as intended. The entire process takes years, from concept to launch of a game, after multiple testing rounds. Any game launching within a few weeks or months from idea to finish will often compromise one or several of these crucial aspects. Not All Blockchain Games Cut Corners\nAlthough there are too many P2E titles focused on monetization, other titles succeed in checking the right boxes. Keeping players engaged requires a gamer-first mindset, with monetization taking a backseat. Merging real-life concepts with P2E gaming, as Silks did, shows opportunities are plentiful. In Silks, players participate in a derivative gaming platform focused on thoroughbred horse racing. In-game avatars represent real-world horses born and bred at a facility belonging to the game's creators. NFTs earn in-game rewards based n the horse's real-world performance and training.\nAnother example of storytelling and engaging gameplay over monetization is Apeiron. The first god game on the blockchain creates a strong narrative, and the team spent over half a decade creating an enticing game world. In addition, players can perform miracles, control their civilization, explore new planets and stars, and generate new planet NFTs through the Celestial Conjunction mechanic. Whether it is planet simulation, PvE world exploration, or PvP/GvG galactic progression, there is always something to do in the Apeiron ecosystem.\nWhen it comes to putting the player first, Plutonians checks the right boxes, too. It is a player-driven game where anyone can create new content: narratives, items, and expansions. Players can share these creations with others without charging them, but they can also sell the content on the marketplace. Putting the player in control of their story - and letting them share the story with others - is an excellent example of gamer empowerment. That is what P2E games should be all about.\nCreating a video game is not something one should rush. Major mainstream gaming publishers can develop full-fledged games on a yearly cycle. Even then, they often reuse and rehash most in-game elements from previous versions as there isn't enough time and the monetization mindset takes the upper hand. That is not the path P2E game developers should pursue. The technology is here to build lasting gaming legacies and empower millions of gamers.",

In addition to being a blockchain believer, it is no secret that Dorsey is a huge Bitcoin advocate as well, having proclaimed in the past that BTC may potentially be the world’s main and only currency by 2030.\nNow, Dorsey has once again backed his views on the “digital gold” cryptocurrency. He explained:\nAccording to the Twitter CEO, Bitcoin is the best digital currency that has been created up to now, and it has the same patterns as the internet – it is consensus-driven and is also controlled by the public versus a centralized order. Speaking to Thor Halvorssen, Dorsey said:\nTwitter to become blockchain-based?\nDorsey disclosed that Twitter was moving towards an open-source social media protocol, with his non-profit initiative Blue Sky working towards establishing one, as shared by Forbes. In the future, Dorsey hopes that Twitter can be a client of Blue Sky, as they are separate entities.\nThe CEO said in regards to Twitter, “We’re not in the content hosting business anymore, we’re in the discovery business.”\nDorsey disclosed that security could never be fully perfected and “that it was a constant race.” However, he said, “The more we’re giving the individual the keys, the safer we’re going to be.”\nThe Twitter CEO hopes that his company will move towards that, and he says that Bitcoin and blockchain have fundamentally already achieved this.",

    "content": "Publicly-traded cryptocurrency mining company Bitfarms has reduced the number of its staff members because of the ongoing social and economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. The crypto mining company is listed on Canada’s TSX Venture Exchange. The mining firm is based in Toronto, Canada and is one of the biggest crypto mining operations in North America.\nBitfarms’ Response to Coronavirus Effect\nAccording to the announcement, Bitfarms is laying off some of its employees on a temporary basis in line with government guidance to assist in combating the spread of coronavirus. However, the cryptocurrency mining company is also implementing permanent cost-saving measures to minimize overhead costs so that to maintain long-term viability.\nJohn Rim, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Bitfarms, stated that such cost-saving measures would help to reduce monthly general and administrative expenses. He said: “Once fully implemented over the next several weeks, we expect the cost-saving measures to reduce our monthly general and administrative expenses by approximately 20 to 25%.”\nJohn Rim further mentioned that the cost-cutting measures would help the company to withstand volatility in business risks associated with crypto mining and to help the firm to remain profitable through the long-term, including potential challenges associated with the forthcoming halving. The much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event is expected to happen next month. During this significant event, Bitcoin will see its mining reward reduce from 12.5 BTCs to 6.25 BTCs.\nIt remained unclear how many employees have been let go and what is the present headcount of the crypto mining company. As per the report, the mining company currently operates five blockchain computing centers in Quebec, Canada, powered by competitively priced and clean hydroelectricity.\nMaintaining the Hash Rate\nBitfarms stated that despite the havoc caused by COVID-19 crisis and the significant decline of Bitcoin prices from March 12th to March 19th, it has managed to maintain an average daily hash rate of 630 petahash per second (PH). During those dates, Bitcoin prices dropped by 50% to below $4,000 at particular days and were slowly recovering. After March 20th, Bitcoin price stood mostly above $6,000 and the crypto mining firm maintained an average daily hash rate of about 750 PH.\nEmiliano Grodzki, Bitfarm’s interim CEO and Chief Strategy Officer, commented on the network difficulty. He stated that their quality and scale of operations has enabled them to continue generating positive cash flow in these difficult times.\nRipple Effects of Coronavirus on Bitcoin Miners\nWhere the COVID-19 crisis is affecting several other businesses, economies, and other financial markets, the field of crypto is not an exception. Several other businesses have closed their work due to this pandemic, and many others have taken safety measures to fight against the epidemic. Crypto mining operations is one area where the effect of the COVID-19 has proved to be dangerous. The virus outbreak has adversely hit the mining operations. Over 40 established crypto mining operations have been forced to close down their businesses because of the price decline of Bitcoin and unprofitable mining equipment business. Bitfarms joins the list of crypto mining companies that have recently laid off their employees. However, it remains to see how crypto mining firms will cope with the current situations.",

    "content": "For the first time in over six months, Bitcoin’s acceptance has been below key support. Yesterday, the prices plummeted below a four-month low of $7800 and this phase of price volatility lingers. Bitcoin is currently trading at $8,030 on Bitstamp. This is a 20% decline from Monday’s opening price of $10,022. Assuming these prices remain at this level till Sunday’s UTC close, this would be the year’s biggest weekly loss so far.\nBitcoin has been dramatically hit with a rapid drop in one-fifth of its value. On Tuesday evening, bitcoin dropped by $1,500 within an hour to hit the $8,000 threshold. The prices dropped again after another sharp sell-off to as low as $7,830. The entire cryptocurrency market has also experienced this rapid drop.\nAccording to data from Bloomberg, bitcoin dropped by 9% and traded for as low as $7,736 in New York. This is its lowest record price since May. The total market capitalization continues to show new multi-month lows across crypto markets. Altcoins are not left out of this phenomenon of losses. Ether (ETH) is currently down by 2.54% and sells at $165.41. XRP is down by 1.54% and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is down by 4.92%, selling at $214.48.finally, Litecoin (LTC) is down by 3.16%, changing hands at $55.01.\nBitcoin prices have failed to hold onto signs of recovery. More downward price actions have been experienced as at yesterday. Back in the second week of January, there was a 13% fall back and this has been the biggest weekly loss so far. If bitcoin experiences a greater loss than this, it would be the most severe of the year. From all indications, only a short-lived corrective bounce is possible over the weekend. It is likely that cryptocurrency would close below $8,719 on Sunday and would be the biggest weekly loss so far.",

According to the report, Ukrainians can only trade or conduct exchange crypto through local or Ukraine-registered foreign exchange platforms.\nExperts argue that is a crucial milestone to Ukraine, as the bill has interpreted the definition of virtual assets “as intangible assets in the form of digital data”, also define the terminology, such as “wallet” for virtual currency or private key; but also allow the country to regulate the crypto market in the future.\nTo prevent money-laundering illegal activities, crypto businesses, which intend to register, need to declare their activities to the authority.\nLocal media, citing an official source, said the Kyiv government plans to open the crypto market for investors and the business sector next year when the tax code and the civil code is amended and ready.\nDespite the current regulators, the administration prefers to introduce more watchdogs to issue permits for crypto businesses.\nUkraine intends to escalate the use of crypto across the whole country. Last month, the administration announced plans to pay salaries to workers by central bank digital currency.",

    "content": "Cyberport’s flagship VC event returns to guide investors and entrepreneurs in the new normal of tech venturing\n100+ venture capital experts and start-ups at Cyberport Venture Capital Forum 2020 on 3-4 Nov to explore post COVID-19 silver linings\nHONG KONG, 16 Oct 2020 – Cyberport Venture Capital Forum (CVCF), Cyberport’s annual tech investment event, will return on 3-4 November. This year’s event will be held in a virtual and interactive format for the first time, covering how the tech venture ecosystem has been reshaped under the new normal for investors, enterprises and technopreneurs. The two-day virtual forum will gather more than 50 global venture capital (VC) experts to examine key silver linings through a plethora of illuminating keynotes and panel discussions. Furthermore, over 80 virtual booths will be set up for start-ups to showcase innovative tech solutions as part of a comprehensive platform to connect start-ups with investors for power pitching and provide extensive opportunities to explore tech venturing dynamics.\nAs the digital tech flagship in Hong Kong, Cyberport is dedicated to facilitating deal flow for start-ups and enriching the regional VC landscape. Echoing the event’s overarching theme, “Navigating New Normal of Tech Venturing”, over 50 international and local experts from major industry players, including Qiming Venture Partners, Alibaba Group, IESE Business School, PayU-Prosus, Vickers Venture Partners, Golden Gate Ventures, Genesis Alternative Ventures, Sino Group, Rethink Education, Blue Elephant Capital, HashKey Digital Asset Group, Angelhub, Radiant Venture Capital, Asia GreenTech Fund, Lingfeng Capital and LEGO Ventures, will discuss the latest global paradigm shift in the tech venturing landscape that has stemmed from the current macro-economic outlook and mega trends, covering topics such as the latest strategies from VC and corporate ventures, new investment spaces like venture debt, the development of education technology (EdTech), the geo-political impact of cross-border capital flow and investor orientations with regards to the China-US trade war and Asia market dynamics, digital transformation in high potential verticals, funding strategies for start-ups, and more.\nCindy Chow, Chairlady of the Cyberport Investors Network and Executive Director of Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, will also be highlighting start-up fundraising updates and plans for investor engagement while celebrating the third anniversary of the dedicated investment platform.\nGlobal events extending frontier of tech venturing\nThis year, two spotlight events under CVCF will further enrich insights in the wider tech venturing space. To enhance support for start-ups and connections with the EdTech sector, CVCF is pleased to co-present the Edventures Global Business Acceleration Summit together with Esperanza, a start-up NGO founded by Mr John C Tsang to catalyse the development of Hong Kong as an EdTech innovation hub in the GBA. The event looks into the developments and trends of the EdTech market, which is one of the most promising markets under the new normal and a key sector of development within Cyberport’s smart living application cluster.\nCVCF will also partner with international tech investment event, Silicon Dragon 2020, to bring in more international investors and start-ups, and explore more tech venturing dynamics, all whilst connecting capital, innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth.\nPeter Yan, CEO of Cyberport, said, “the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 epidemic to the economy have at the same time accelerated the digital transformation of enterprises and the wide adoption of various digital business models like online-to-offline, virtual events, work and learn from home. There is also an increasing demand in tech-assisted healthcare and other contactless lifestyle applications. All these translate to an unprecedented conducive business environment for our tech start-ups to grow and more than ever, a strong need for investors to leverage the Cyberport platform to identify quality companies with strong talents and promising business models. Cyberport remains committed to spring-boarding start-ups to success, and the Cyberport Venture Capital Forum (CVCF) is the key event for us to bridge investors with our tech community as well as the annual destination for our Cyberport Investor Network (CIN) to gather, share their views on the latest developments and exchange insights on coming trends. I look forward to another year of illuminating sharings by industry leaders and productive exchanges and matchings between the tech community and investors.”\nFirst month-long CVCF virtual experience live from 21 October\nStarting from 21 October, CVCF will kick off its very first month-long virtual experience with conference and workshop content available 24/7 on its dedicated event platform. The Innovator showcase will feature virtual booths of tech solutions and allow investors and audience members to interact with the most enterprising innovators to explore collaborations. At the Founder Stage, short pitch videos will be streamed for promising start-ups across different fields to present their projects to investors and to gain exposure. These will also be available to view on demand on the event platform. Investor matching sessions will allow one-on-one investor meetings with start-ups based on tech sectors and investment appetite between late October to early November.\nExtended international engagement to enrich pool and facilitate investment matching\nTo reach a wider global audience of investors and start-ups, this year is the first time CVCF is partnering with the Consulates General of Canada and Israel respectively, Macau Young Entrepreneur Innovation Centre, and leading co-working spaces in Hong Kong to bring in start-ups and investors.\nThe Edventures Global Business Acceleration Summit on the second event day will gather innovators, investors, educators and talent development professionals who are looking for solutions and opportunities in the education technology space. Renowned speakers of the event include Richard Culatta, CEO, International Society for Technology in Education, Kamran Elahian, Chairman and Founder of Global Innovation Catalyst and Matt Greenfield, Managing Partner of Rethink Education.\nDuring the Summit, 10 finalists of the Edventures GBA Fellowship, a global competition to help growth stage EdTech start-ups expand internationally, will compete for the chance to connect with business matching and market expansion consultancies. The finalists from Hong Kong, Finland, Mainland China, the UK and the US, will be showcasing their ventures, ranging from early childhood education to lifelong learning solutions. Among them are two Cyberport community start-ups, Mandarin Matrix, which operates online Mandarin learning classrooms for K12, and Xccelerate, which provides enterprise training in skills for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. These finalists together with EdTech start-ups at Cyberport will also exhibit at the concurrent Virtual Global Edventures Expo from 23 Oct - 22 Nov.\nCVCF is a highly anticipated flagship tech venture event for investors and entrepreneurs in the digital technology domain. This year, to further enrich industry and market insights of the forum, a series of pre-event webinars have been held since July in anticipation of the main event to allow industry leaders to share their insights and fresh perspectives on smart investments and digital transformation, and to help enterprises pivot in the new normal. Featured programmes have been uploaded to the event’s platform.\nAbout Cyberport\nCyberport is an innovative digital community with close to 1,600 start-ups and technology companies.

    "content": "India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), stated that cryptocurrencies are not banned, including Ethereum and Bitcoin in the nation as it only highlighted the risks linked to crypto trading to regulated entities like banks.\nThe RBI raised these sentiments as a response to a petition filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) that wanted a reconsideration made with regard to a 2018 circular which directed regulated entities to avoid cryptocurrencies.\nRBI highlights risks linked to cryptocurrencies\nThe central bank stressed that some of the dangers associated with cryptocurrencies include money laundering and terrorist financing. These are remarks shared after the IAMAI’s members challenged the RBI’s stance on banning cryptocurrencies at the nation’s Supreme Court.\nIn a hearing held earlier this month, the IAMAI debated that without a law in place prohibiting crypto trading, it remained a legal business activity though RBI had hindered it by blocking access to banking channels.\nThe affidavit noted, “Firstly, the RBI has not prohibited VCs (virtual currencies) in the country. The RBI has directed the entities regulated by it to not provide services to those persons or entities dealing in or settling VCs… The RBI has been able to ringfence the entities regulated by it from being involved in activities that pose reputational and financial risks along with other legal and operational risks.”\nRBI responded to IAMAI’s objections saying, “Any possible avenues which facilitate anonymous cross-border fund transfer have to be acted upon swiftly and stringently dealt with. It is an admitted fact that VCs have been used to purchase illegal and illicit goods ranging from guns and ammunition to drugs.”\nThe central bank insisted that it was not against any technological innovation as it encouraged the adoption and development of distributed ledger technology.",

    "summary": "The financing from Foundry will enable Core Scientific and its clients to continue shifting global mining operations to North America",
    "content": "BELLEVUE, WA — DEC. 9, 2020 — Core Scientific, the largest digital mining operation in the U.S., announced it has partnered with Foundry to receive up to $23 million dollars in financing for Core Scientific and its clients’ mining equipment. The financing from Foundry provides Core Scientific and its clients the opportunity to expand capacity for mining machines in North America. Foundry is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG).\nFoundry has provided Core Scientific’s clients with $11 million in mining equipment financing, and provided Core Scientific with up to $12 million for mining equipment. This $23 million investment made by Foundry is one of the largest financing deals in the mining industry this year. DCG has committed to investing $100 million into Foundry through 2021.\nCore Scientific will continue to use this financing to expand its mining fleet in its locations throughout North America. The financing being provided to Core Scientific helped play an important role in Core Scientific’s substantial 17,000-unit order the company placed with Bitmain earlier this year, which at the time of purchase, was the largest order Bitmain had sent to the U.S. As only a finite number of mining machines are available, and many are located in places such as China or Southeast Asia, Core Scientific’s ability to expand its fleet means more mining machines, and therefore more hashpower, will shift to being hosted in North America.\nKevin Turner, CEO of Core Scientific, said: “DCG is a powerhouse in bitcoin and blockchain known for their support of industry innovation. Foundry’s investment will allow Core Scientific to continue expanding in North America while providing more hashpower to our existing and future clients. This is a partnership between two of the biggest names in the mining industry and will further establish North America as a leading destination in the mining space.”\nMike Colyer, CEO of Foundry and former Core Scientific executive, said: “Prior to joining Foundry, I led business development efforts at Core Scientific, where I was able to witness firsthand how the company is pioneering innovation in blockchain infrastructure. We’re very confident in the organization and its goal, which is why we’re making a significant investment into the cryptocurrency mining industry with Core Scientific.”\nFor more information, please visit https://www.corescientific.com.",

    "content": "Despite speculations that the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry is rapidly approaching bubble territory, the Winklevoss twins affirmed the contrary, saying that the current DeFi craze is a revolution in the making.\nIs the DeFi bubble going to burst?\nThis week, DeFi tokens have been in the red, with the crypto market struggling to stay afloat and maintain an upward trend. Some of the largest DeFi tokens by market capitalization have recorded high double-digit price dips this week, such as UMA, YFI (Yearn.Finance), LEND (Aave), and COMP (Compound).\nHowever, despite the bearish momentum, the Winklevoss twins have asserted that DeFi’s boom was here to stay. The Bitcoin billionaires backed the Ethereum-based financial protocols, saying that the current DeFi boom was nothing like the “2017 initial coin offering craze”, where ICO became highly popularized before the crypto bubble burst, with nearly half of the projects failing by 2018.\nGemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said:\nWinklevoss expressed that the current decentralized finance hype was here to stay, going against a major concern that many investors seem to be having. Some crypto experts, such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, expressed that DeFi seemed to be unsustainable in the long run.\nButerin previously addressed the sharp supply inflation perceived among many governance tokens and said that they would have to be printed constantly to keep the underlying ecosystem running. In the long run, yield farming tokens would prove to be unsustainable, according to the Ethereum co-founder.\nCameron Winklevoss and Buterin appear to be divided on their stance about the DeFi industry’s sustainability. Tyler Winklevoss backed his brother and expressed through a tweet:\nYield farming consists of a way in which DeFi projects award governance tokens to users who generate liquidity, either through borrowing, lending, or token exchange.\nThe gained crypto assets are locked into a specific DeFi protocol, which operates off the Ethereum blockchain for the most part. It is in a way comparable to the annual interest an investor can earn from keeping money in a traditional banking institution.\nUniswap's UNI bounces back\nCurrently, despite the observed downtrend of the majority of the crypto market, Uniswap's UNI token has recorded a rebound within the past 24 hours, making an 11 percent gain within a day. UNI token was only launched last week, with one billion governance tokens minted. At the time of writing, Uniswap's platform is ranked first on the DeFi market in terms of total value locked (TVL), estimated to be worth $1.7 billion cryptocurrencies.",

    "content": "EOS, a platform that is designed to allow developers to build decentralized apps with its native token \"EOS”, has seen its token rise for three consecutive days by 110%. Yesterday, EOS broke the psychological barrier of $10 yesterday.\nThis rise may be related to the new project EOS' parent company Block.one is currently exploring. According to sources familiar with the talks, Block.one may have purchased the domain name Bullish.com for $1.08 million.\nAccording to previous media reports, Bullish is expected to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in the middle of 2021.\nAt the same time, the power-up model of EOS also provides a more favourable way for EOS holders to make money.\nThis protocol allows traders to pay a fee to power up their account for 24 hours in order to conduct transactions on the network without having to pay transaction fees for each transaction.\nAccording to Coinmarketcap, EOS, the nineteenth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $ $20,285,290,163 has risen by 92.56%% in the past 7 days.\nAt the time of writing, EOS is trading at $12.22.\nEOS Price Analysis\nJudging from the daily candlestick chart, in tandem with EOS' explosive growth, its transaction volume has also been surging. The daily trading volume for EOS on the Binance crypto exchange is as high as $244.233 million, which is the highest EOS trades has climbed since the token's listing on Binance. This also means that the bulls are buying in bulk.\nBut today, the enthusiasm of the bulls seems to have weakened. Although EOS touched $13.25, it has still yet to retest its all-time high of $15.68, which was attained on June 2, 2018. Today's long upper shadow line of the candlestick indicates that the bears are triggering a number of sales.\nDue to the declining linkage of the mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin, EOS bulls seem to be hesitant to enter at such a high price.\nBitcoin bulls are actively defending the $56,000 support position.\nThe transaction price of EOS/USDT is much higher than the Exponential Moving Average ribbon. Both the upward sloping moving average and the bullish MACD index indicate that the bulls are currently dominating the market.\nStochastic RSI is reaching the overbought zone, exceeding the 80 mark. A reading above 80 suggests that the RSI may be reaching extreme highs and this could signal a pullback from EOS altcoin.\nIn the short term, EOS/USDT is likely to experience a horizontal movement around $11.00 before it tests its record-high of $15.68.",

    "summary": "The UN Office on Drugs and Crime's latest report reveals an alarming increase in cryptocurrency misuse and advanced technological crime in East and Southeast Asia. The study focuses on the challenges faced by law enforcement against the backdrop of evolving online casinos, cyberfraud, and tech-driven underground banking networks.",
    "content": "The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report, titled \"Casinos, Money Laundering, Underground Banking, and Transnational Organized Crime in East and Southeast Asia: A Hidden and Accelerating Threat,\" issued in January 2024, reveals a complex and concerning situation regarding the misuse of cryptocurrencies and technological innovations in illicit economies, particularly in East and Southeast Asia.\nKey Findings\nTransformation of Organized Crime: There has been a significant evolution in transnational organized crime in Southeast Asia, particularly with the growth in cross-border trafficking of synthetic drugs and other commodities. Organized crime groups have embraced technology, leading to a revolutionized crime environment in the region.\nRise of Online Casinos and Cyberfraud: The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the mushrooming of online casinos and cyberfraud across Southeast Asia, especially in the Mekong region. Organized crime groups running many of these operations have utilized data mining, blockchain technology, and increasingly generative AI, significantly complicating law enforcement efforts.\nUnderground Banking and Money Laundering: The report highlights the integral role of casinos and junkets in the underground banking and money laundering infrastructure. This includes various methods like cash-in cash-out, collusion between gamblers, junket financing, and misuse of casino VIP cash accounts.\nInfiltration of Cryptocurrency in Illegal Activities: Organized crime groups are increasingly integrating cryptocurrencies into their illegal betting operations. This includes the use of sophisticated high-speed money laundering 'motorcade' teams specializing in underground USDT – fiat currency exchanges.\nChallenges in Monitoring and Regulation: The rise of cryptocurrency-integrated operations, points running syndicates, and the complex nature of online gambling platforms pose significant challenges to authorities. The anonymous nature of transactions and the lack of adequate compliance staff in online gambling sectors make it difficult to track and verify the source of funds.\nGenerative AI and Deepfake Fraud: There's a growing concern about the use of advanced technologies like generative AI and deepfake for cyber fraud schemes. These technologies enable scammers to create highly realistic images and voices, leading to sophisticated investment fraud and other malicious activities.\nPolicy and Enforcement Recommendations: The report suggests the development of national action plans and a regional strategy to address these challenges. It emphasizes the need for revised legislation related to money laundering, asset forfeiture, and casino management. Additionally, it recommends the establishment of a regional inter-agency forum to share information and intelligence, improved digital forensic capabilities, and mandatory filing of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) by casinos.\nConclusion\nThe report underscores the growing complexity of organized crime in the digital age, highlighting the need for stronger regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to tackle these evolving threats.",

    "summary": "South Korean game developer WeMade counters fraud allegations by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors, asserting compliance exemptions for its digital asset systems and Phoenix DEX amidst regulatory investigations.",
    "content": "WeMade, a South Korean Web3 game developer, has emphatically denied allegations of coin over-issuance fraud. These accusations were brought forward by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office, which has been investigating the company for potentially circumventing regulations and making unfair profits. WeMade's defense centers around its digital asset storage system and decentralized exchange, Phoenix DEX, claiming they are exempt from compliance requirements that mandate registration with authorities for virtual asset service providers.\nThe company argues that its services, including the Play Wallet and PNIX DEX, operate outside the regulatory framework requiring control over user assets via private keys. WeMade maintains that its wallet services are decentralized, asserting that it does not control personal encryption keys and, therefore, is not engaged in activities necessitating regulatory reporting for virtual asset transfer, storage, or exchange.\nThis ongoing investigation has put WeMade under considerable scrutiny, given its pivotal role in the Web3 and blockchain gaming sectors. Notably, WeMade is renowned for its Legend of Mir series and had ambitious plans for integrating blockchain technology into its gaming ecosystem. The company's strategy notably includes the WEMIX token and the development of a blockchain mainnet aimed at supporting play-to-earn (P2E) functionalities across a wide range of games.\nWeMade's challenges have been compounded by previous controversies, including issues leading to the delisting of WEMIX tokens from major South Korean crypto exchanges. Allegations of unauthorized fund liquidation and fraudulent disclosure practices have been significant factors in these developments.\nDespite these hurdles, WeMade has expressed its intention to continue challenging what it perceives as unjust treatment by regulatory bodies and certain market participants. The company has taken legal steps, including appealing court decisions and filing complaints with regulatory authorities, to fight for its vision of integrating blockchain technology into the gaming industry.",

    "content": "Power Ledger, a Perth-based energy trading software company, and Powerclub, an Australian electricity wholesaler, have signed a deal to offer households unparalleled authority over their energy usage via blockchain.\nPower ledger is famed for its blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer framework that prompts energy trading between households. The commercial partnership, therefore, seeks to enable Powerclub users to pool their net battery and solar storage as this will serve as a virtual power plant (VPP). This will make them attain considerable access to wholesale electricity prices prompting more control over what they pay per their energy consumption.\nThe blockchain-enabled VPP technology availed by Power Ledger will permit Powerclub households possessing batteries to pool their stored solar power and sell it whenever price spikes and high energy demands are witnessed.\nThe Australian Urge for Energy Trading Platforms\nThe Energy Market Commission in Australia has already spelled out the urge for future grids to act as energy trading platforms.\nJemma Green, the chairman, and co-founder of Power Ledger stipulated: “The Australian Energy Market Commission has already flagged the need for grids of the future to become energy trading platforms. The future of the energy industry will be decentralized and democratized, like what we’ve seen happen to the taxi industry with rideshare apps like Uber and Ola. You no longer need to be a massive electricity company to commoditize energy,”\nUnder the present system, energy consumers do not get value for money as the electricity retailer usually subjects them to additional hidden costs and mark-ups to cater for supply costs. This approach makes high energy prices inevitable in Australia.\nPowerclub’s CEO, Stuart McPherson, stipulated: “If there’s one thing that Powerclub stands by, it’s transparency. We’ve partnered with Power Ledger as we see their technology as being critical in reducing price opacity in the energy market.”\nThe blockchain-driven virtual power plant, therefore, seeks to offer households transparency about their energy consumption, as well as empower them economically.",

This number is continuously increasing, depicting the growing adoption.\nThis follows the launch of its sidechain solution, the Sun Network, in August. The Sun Network is a scaling solution that aims to provide unlimited scalability to the Tron MainNet.\nThe Network incorporates several scaling projects such as DAppChain, which is a sidechain scaling project that offers unlimited scalability to the Tron MainNet. Furthermore, it focuses on improving the transaction processing systems of the smart contract transactions as well as lowering transaction fees.\nLater in September, Sun indicated that BTCTRON could be deployed on the Tron DeFI ecosystem, which materialized earlier this month. As a result, users can utilize a swap feature on crypto exchange Poloniex to exchange their Bitcoin for BTCTRON.\nAiding transfers\nThe wrapped version of BTC enables users on the Tron blockchain to make different transfers. Moreover, it can be utilized on DeFi platforms found on the Tron network.\nIn May, Tron received $2 million from the US government in releif funds due to the coronavirus pandemic. This news emerged after the American administration created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help small businesses stay afloat.\nEarlier this month, another distributed-ledger technology developer IOTA Foundation introduced IOTA Access, an open-source DLT framework, for decentralized and automated smart device access control capable of managing billions of machines. It was expected to enable smart device owners and users to request or grant access to their data stream or device in an auditable, contactless, permissionless, and remote manner.",

    "content": "The Algorand (ALGO) Foundation has recently faced an unprecedented challenge. Staci Warden, the CEO of the Algorand Foundation, became the target of a severe cyber attack, with her social media account being compromised. For over 15 hours, unidentified individuals posted racial slurs and derogatory remarks, not only tarnishing the reputation of the Foundation but also raising questions about the security measures in place.\nThe incident highlights the persistent vulnerability of high-profile individuals in the digital domain, particularly in the sensitive and high-stakes world of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Despite the Algorand Foundation's prompt response and recovery efforts, the attackers managed to hold control over the account, using it to mock followers and undermine the platform's integrity.\nThis situation brings to light the broader implications of cybersecurity in the blockchain industry. Algorand, known for its technological advancements and contributions to the blockchain ecosystem, now faces a critical test of its operational and security protocols. The incident could have ripple effects across the sector, prompting other organizations to reassess their security measures.\nThe persistent nature of this attack raises several questions. Firstly, the identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Are they merely online trolls, or do they represent a more sinister threat to the blockchain industry? Secondly, the effectiveness of existing security measures for high-profile individuals in the tech world is under scrutiny. How can industry leaders bolster their defenses against such breaches?\nStaci Warden's ordeal is not an isolated incident. In recent years, several tech executives and cryptocurrency leaders have faced similar cyber attacks. This pattern underscores the need for stronger, more resilient cybersecurity measures in the industry. The Algorand Foundation's experience serves as a cautionary tale for other organizations in the digital finance sector.\nIn conclusion, the cyber attack on Staci Warden's social media account is more than just a personal violation; it's a wake-up call for the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the need for robust security frameworks and proactive measures to protect individuals and organizations from such malicious activities.",

    "summary": "In an effort to break economic ties with the United States and escape the US Dollar dominance of the global markets, Turkey is adopting blockchain and cryptocurrency at a greatly accelerated rate.",
    "content": "In an effort to break economic ties with the United States and escape the US Dollar dominance of the global markets, Turkey is adopting blockchain and cryptocurrency at a greatly accelerated rate.\nAs Turkey’s economy teeters on the edge of a potential recession, the people and the government in the nation are seeking alternative solutions in Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain.\nThe Turkish people are looking to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a path to financial autonomy, while the Turkish Government is accelerating blockchain and cryptocurrency services development to pull the nation out of the path of the coming recession.\nAccording to a recent article by Forbes, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency adoption is on the rise in Turkey as the nation’s economy hits a state of free fall. Turkey’s financial reserves have been depleted and there is rising economic tension with the US—sending the Turkish Lira to the lowest level in its history.\nTurkey has dramatically increased resources directed towards the development of blockchain infrastructure and cryptocurrency technology to save the economy from recession. Along with experimenting with a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Turkey is investing in blockchain research, encouraging youth education into blockchain tech and giving more support to tech startups—all in an attempt to save the economy without relying on external resources and the United States' support.\nBreaking Turkish Dependency on Swift systems\nTurkey’s interest in blockchain and a fast transacting CBDC is due to their reliance on SWIFT remittance.\nEmre Aksoy, a strategic advisor to Turkish government bodies on crypto adoption and regulation told Forbes, “The Turkish government are trying to figure out alternatives to the SWIFT system. This is public knowledge.”\nMore than 10,000 financial institutions and corporations in over 200 countries use the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (\"SWIFT\") to execute international money transfers, making it an integral part of global cross‑border banking transactions. Aksoy explained, “3-4% of all countries’ GDP is being wasted on transaction costs and banking intermediaries. Cryptocurrency technology will cut these costs and reduce our reliance and dependency on other nations. Turkey now has a real shot at saving its economy.\nAs a consequence of Turkey’s reliance on SWIFT for remittance, the government is creating large scale blockchain infrastructure and developing their own central bank digital currency.\nBlockchain-based systems hold a unique advantage over SWIFT which is a centralized service, while a blockchain is decentralized. This matters significantly because, in the case of SWIFT, you must rely on centralized financial institutions for every payment or transaction, which means that all transactions incur higher fees as the money must first be sent through the centralized system and then on to the recipient. In addition, as each transaction must be verified by the central authority, SWIFT payments can take days. Blockchain potentially enables safer, faster, and cheaper transactions.\nIn addition, the Turkish government is exploring CBDCs while also investigating potential membership of the Russian version of SWIFT, known as SPFS. New tech like blockchain and cryptocurrencies naturally are being looked at simultaneously. Despite traditionally having strong ties to the United States, the government is now showing some real aggression—making it known that there are other ways for them to do business. Turkey now realizes the strategic significance of their country in the global market and are making a stand against the US influence on their sovereignty.\nAksoy shared his belief that blockchain and cryptocurrency can help both the government and the Turkish people find a united path forward, one which can be mutually beneficial. He said, “This isn’t a quick make money scheme. It has the potential to protect the people and the wealth of the nation if implemented and welcomed with open arms.”\nTurkey’s Population is Ready for Crypto\nOver the last year, relations between the US and Turkey have dropped to an all-time low. Although the two countries have been NATO allies for nearly 70 years, that partnership has greatly deteriorated mainly over security concerns and the impact of the Syrian War.\nA 2019 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 73% of Turks had a negative view of the United States, with only 20% having a positive view, the lowest among countries polled. The same study also showed only 11% of Turks had confidence in the current US leader, President Donald Trump, with 84% having no confidence in him.\nMoving away from SWIFT and the US dollar is the most effective and potent way for Turkey to destabilize the United States’ influence in the region and the population are ready. Turkey has evolved into a thriving crypto-friendly nation and a theater of commerce for exchanges and blockchain businesses.\nTurkey has a young population with a median age of around 30 years, so adoption of new tech is higher than most of Europe. More than 90 percent of adults have a smartphone and mobile internet users are north of 50 million. As such, Turkey’s population is a part of the rapidly growing cryptocurrency adoption.\nIn a recent interview with Ciara Sun, Head of Global Business Development & Partnerships at Huobi Group, was amazed at the rate of adoption and potential for cryptocurrency to thrive. Sun remarked, “We are 100% confident in Turkey—Turkey is a really great market. I was really surprised to discover that 20% of the population owns cryptocurrency, and the Lira is the fifth most popular fiat currency for crypto pairing in the world.”",

    "content": "Blockchain technology has been a game-changer, fueling the rise of decentralized applications and introducing novel concepts like Web3, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Leading this significant transition is BNB Chain, a platform dedicated to creating cross-chain/multi-chain infrastructure and interoperability. They aim to lay the groundwork for the next 1 billion Web3 users, making it effortless for Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Metaverse dApps to scale.\nIn our exclusive interview today with Walter Lee, Web3 Gaming Growth Lead in BNB Chain Innovation, we delve deeper into the strategies BNB Chain is employing to reach this ambitious target, their plans to bridge the gap between decentralized technologies and traditional users, their approach to keeping transaction fees affordable, and a sneak peek into some upcoming updates and features. We also touch upon BNB Chain's competitiveness in the rapidly evolving blockchain space and their unyielding support for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Keep reading to discover their innovative strategies, upcoming developments, and insights on the future of Web3.\nBNB Chain aims to reach 1 billion users. What strategies are in place to achieve this ambitious goal?\nBNB Chain provides cross-chain/multi-chain infrastructure and interoperability to lay the foundation for the next 1 billion Web3 users making it super easy for Web3 Gaming, NFTs and Metaverse dApps to scale.\nTo accommodate a large number of users, BNB Chain will improve performance and scalability. In addition to its storage network BNB Greenfield, it has optimized its infrastructure by implementing layer 2 solutions including opBNB into BNB Chain’s modular stack. Its EVM-compatibility means that it will be a value-add to the network and handle increased transaction volume and user demand\nPerformance improvements including its Layer 2 solutions such as opBNB is able to hit around 4K TPS. Also, it has an estimated 90% reduction in gas fees at $0.005. This creates a responsive and low latency environment for users.The gaming industry is huge and growing at a rapid pace, there are an estimated 3 billion gamers out there and there has been a lot of growth for web3 gaming on BNB Chain in recent times. Hence, we believe that Gaming will be one of the key verticals for BNB Chain to achieve 1 billion users!\nHow does BNB Chain plan to bridge the gap between decentralized technologies and users who still rely on consistent, centralized relationships and identities?\nWeb3 technology is not exactly a revolution for existing industries, it is in fact a market expansion. BNB Chain understands that existing users cannot be disrupted instantly. There has been observable maturity in the development growth in the web3 space to bridge this gap, starting from the user journey. For most dApps, there has been a move away from “forcing” users to connect to a blockchain wallet. Instead, dApps could leverage social logins to generate wallets attached to the social identity and assets would be automatically dropped into the linked wallet. Users would then be empowered to make their own decisions in terms of managing the owned assets.\nFor developers, BNB Chain’s goal is to provide the best and most extensive infrastructure for true web3 developments. For example, BNB Greenfield, which is a decentralized storage platform designed to revolutionize the data economy by utilizing the power of decentralized technology for data ownership and management. Built within the BNB Chain ecosystem, this platform introduces a decentralized approach to data management that seamlessly integrates with BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\nFeatures include:\nCompared to other decentralized storage services like IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave, and Web3.storage, Greenfield offers several advantages. It is designed to be highly scalable, cloud-native, and compatible with both Web2 and Web3 standards. It provides strong performance and reliability regardless of the amount of data being stored. The integration with BSC and the EVM environment allows for fully programmable capabilities and a wide range of use cases.\nOverall, the web3 industry is still very young so there will be continued innovations that will aid users and developers in adding benefits and features to various industries such as in Finance and Gaming.\nCan you tell us about BNB Chain’s transaction fees, and what measures are in place to keep them affordable for users?\nBNB Chain’s transaction fees have been one of the lowest in the industry, starting off at around 5 gwei. In recent times, BNB Chain’s validators have opted towards reducing that further in order to encourage competitiveness, which will result in positive ecosystem growth. As of April 2023, BNB Chain’s gas fees have further reduced to 3 gwei, and that is around a few cents per transaction.\nOn top of that, BNB Chain has recently launched the testnet for opBNB, which will further reduce the gas fees by around 90% to $0.005! This should be very exciting for both developers and users, opBNB is expected to launch into the mainnet in Q3 this year.\nCan you discuss any upcoming updates or features that users can look forward to on BNB Chain?\nopBNB – The opBNB Testnet is live and we are calling on testnet Validators and dApp Builders to try the Testnet and provide feedback.\nopBNB represents our commitment to ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for users, developers, and projects on BSC. This development is part of our ongoing mission to bring the power of blockchain to everyone while embracing and driving forward innovation.\nopBNB is BSC's answer to the scalability challenge that has limited the mass adoption of blockchain technology. As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer 2 chain, opBNB solution is based on Optimism OP Stack to further enhance BSC scalability while preserving affordability and security.\nOptimistic Rollups was proposed to reduce the computational load on the main chain by executing transactions off-chain and only posting transaction data on-chain as calldata. This approach drastically improves scalability by bundling multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main chain.\nThe mix of BSC's strong ability and opBNB's dedicated new features, which includes making data access easier, improving the cache system, and adjusting the submission process algorithm to allow simultaneous operations (also known as batcher), allows OpBNB to push the gas limit up to a whopping 100M. This is a big jump from Optimism's 30M (source: link). Thanks to these new features, OpBNB can handle over 4000 transfer transactions each second and keep the average cost of a transaction below 0.005 USD. By harnessing the power of Optimistic Rollups, opBNB moves computation and state storage off-chain, alleviating congestion and driving down transaction costs.\nBNB Greenfield – The BNB Greenfield testnet is live and the community is calling on testnet Validators, Storage providers (SPs), and dApp Builders to join the decentralized storage tech stack to shape the future of data ownership in Web3.\nBNB Greenfield is an innovative blockchain and storage platform that seeks to unleash the power of decentralized technology on data ownership and the data economy. It is a decentralized, open-source storage chain with BNB as its token.\nWith a focus on facilitating decentralized data management and access, Greenfield aims to revolutionize the data economy by easing the storing and management of data and linking data ownership with the DeFi context of BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\nWhat sets Greenfield apart from existing centralized and decentralized storage systems are its three key components:\nHackvolution – BNB Chain are inviting all developers, researchers and scientists to participate in the online Hackvolution event that seeks to redefine and empower the next-generation of dApps with the potential of opBNB and BNB Greenfield.\nWhether you are interested in Infrastructure, DeFi, Gaming, or AI, this hackathon provides the platform to explore, innovate, and make a lasting impact. This is your chance to demonstrate your creativity, technical skills, and entrepreneurial spirit as you work alongside a vibrant community of like-minded individuals.\nThe hackathon is supported by industry leaders such as COMBO, CyberConnect, Hooked Protocol, Alibaba Cloud, Google Cloud and Ultiverse. Generous rewards, including cash prizes, marketing packages, participation in the BNB Chain’s Gas Grant program, and discounted access to essential tools and services, are up for grabs.\nIt’s an exciting chance for dvelopers to gain recognition, network with industry experts, and propel their project to new heights.\nHow does BNB Chain plan to stay competitive as the blockchain space continues to evolve and new players enter the market?\nBNB Chain is one of the most up to date and extensive infrastructure technology. A good example would be the launches of zkBNB and opBNB, as well as the fully decentralized storage layer, Greenfield. With an extensive infrastructure, developers and users get to build and experience Web3 in the best ways possible, building the strongest advantage of BNB Chain our large and fast growing community.\nBNB Chain has more than 3 million in our social communities, and over 1500 dApps. This vibrant range of products and community size are the key contributions for over 1 million daily active on-chain users in this current market.\nAs “BNB” actually means “Build N Build”, we believe by continuously building with developers and community through support provision and engagements respectively, BNB Chain will continue to be a dominant ecosystem in the web3 industry.\nHow does BNB Chain support the development of decentralized applications (dApps)?\nBNB Chain recognizes the importance of the community and hence, we have been constantly engaging developers and users. We understand that developers are our pillars for growth, and there are many challenges in developing Web3 products, so BNB Chain has been providing various supports including but not limited to:\nThere's no doubt that BNB Chain is making significant strides in propelling the mass adoption of blockchain technology, particularly in the realms of Web3, NFTs, and Metaverse. The platform's cutting-edge features such as opBNB, BNB Greenfield, and upcoming initiatives like Hackvolution, promise to revolutionize not just the world of blockchain but the larger digital ecosystem as well.\nBNB Chain's commitment to remaining agile in the ever-changing tech industry, their comprehensive support to developers, and their dedication to building a robust, active, and vibrant community all testify to their potential for continued growth and success. As the blockchain space continues to evolve, we look forward to seeing more innovative developments from BNB Chain and its dedicated team.",

    "summary": "Australia’s New South Wales is proposing a flexible regulatory reform to accommodate the thriving blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem",
    "content": "The Australian state of New South Wales is exploring a “flexible” regulatory reform for blockchain and other emerging technologies in the state.\nThe proposed blockchain regulation reform is being pushed by New South Wales’ Department of Treasury and the proposals were published in a research paper released by the department on Tuesday, July 28.\nAs described in the research paper, the rising global traction blockchain and digital currencies are gaining has necessitated the need to revise New South Wales regulations in order to be well-positioned to accommodate the growth. Such regulatory models will help provide a “flexibility” that will not hamper the growth potentials of firms with the yearnings to grow.\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how rapidly circumstances can change. It has presented significant and unprecedented challenges to people, organizations, and markets globally. Governments had to quickly respond with more flexible regulation to address the health, social and economic impacts of the pandemic. The NSW Government responded with a raft of temporary regulatory changes to protect citizens while allowing businesses to flexibly deliver their products and services and enabling ongoing legal and administrative requirements to be met through digital solutions,” New South Wales Treasury Secretary Michael Pratt AM said in a statement.\nAustralia is Pushing More Inclusive Regulations\nDigital currencies are becoming a commonplace in Australia as the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment means is contributing to the obvious transition to a digital economy. As much as there are positive upticks in the country, so are there cases of fraud as possible in crypto-centric economies. With these developments, Australian blockchain stakeholders are calling for an inclusive blockchain regulatory supervision.\nThe New South Wales regulatory proposal which will be employing a co-regulation, where the industry develops its own arrangements, which would subsequently be underpinned by government legislation will serve as a viable template for which other Australian states can model.",

    "summary": "The UK plans to establish digital asset regulation within a year to take advantage of blockchain's benefits for the private sector and the economy, according to Andrew Griffith, the economic secretary to the UK Treasury.",
    "content": "The United Kingdom is looking to establish regulations for digital assets within the next 12 months, according to Andrew Griffith, the economic secretary to the UK Treasury. In an interview with CNBC on April 17, Griffith stated that the country aims to take advantage of the benefits that blockchain technology can bring to the private sector and the overall economy. He added that the UK's long-term vision is to enable companies to maximize the opportunities presented by crypto assets through effective regulation.\nThis move towards regulating digital assets reflects the UK government's recognition of the growing importance of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The implementation of sound crypto regulation will provide greater clarity for businesses and investors operating in the space, reducing the uncertainty and risk associated with digital assets.\nThe potential benefits of blockchain technology are significant, particularly for industries such as finance, where it can streamline processes, reduce costs, and increase transparency. However, the lack of clear regulation has been a barrier to wider adoption, with many companies reluctant to engage with crypto assets due to the associated risks.\nGriffith's announcement has been met with enthusiasm from the crypto community, with many viewing it as a positive step towards wider adoption of digital assets. It is hoped that this move will lead to increased investment and innovation in the space, further driving the growth of the UK's digital economy.\nThe UK is not alone in recognizing the importance of regulating digital assets. Governments around the world are increasingly looking at ways to establish clear guidelines for the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. While some countries have taken a more cautious approach to regulation, others, such as Switzerland and Malta, have been more proactive in establishing themselves as cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdictions.\nThe establishment of digital asset regulation is not without its challenges, however. One of the key issues facing regulators is how to strike a balance between protecting consumers and promoting innovation. Finding the right balance between regulation and innovation will be critical to ensuring the success of the UK's digital asset industry.\nIn conclusion, the UK's move towards regulating digital assets is a positive development for the country's digital economy. By providing greater clarity and reducing risk, effective regulation will encourage wider adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As the UK works towards establishing its regulatory framework, it will be important to strike a balance between promoting innovation and protecting consumers.",

    "summary": "CoinMarketCap is a renowned cryptocurrency and exchange data aggregator. Recently purchased by Binance, the site is currently under fire from users who claim that exchange rankings are being manipulated.",
    "content": "As the number of blockchain-based digital currencies continue growing by the day, there is a need to keep track of them all. This will help market analytics and investors in staying up to date with their choice of cryptocurrency. There are lots of functional cryptocurrency tracking sites, but CoinMarketCap is by far the most prominent. The website tracks the capitalization of various cryptocurrencies by listing prices, available supply (amount of coins/tokens that are currently in circulation), trade volumes and market capitalizations. CoinMarketCap has been put under the spotlight as some of its users have taken to Twitter to point out serious inconsistencies in their rankings, specifically citing the case of the BitMex exchange which inexplicably sits at 175.\nCosmonauts Position\nAccording to Cosmonaut, the CoinMarketCap user who took to Twitter to express his displeasure, the ranking of cryptocurrency exchange BitMex at 175 is simply unjustifiable.\nIn Cosmonaut's view, BitMex has the second largest web traffic factor of all the exchanges which according to CoinMarketCap was originally supposed to be how exchanges are ranked. The comments have drawn criticism from analysts, with many indicating that they had long suspected that Changpeng 'CZ\" Zhao would manipulate the rankings, ever since Binance took over CoinMarketCap\nChange of Ranking Algorithms\nCoinMarketCap has changed its ranking algorithm from the traditional web traffic factor to a more recent Confidence Score. This change was effected since the coin market aggregator was purchased by Binance for an undisclosed sum in April. In this new ranking, Binance ranks as the number one exchange which also calls for more criticisms.\nAccording to data on CoinMarketCap, BitMex has an almost perfect traffic scoreat 960, just 40 points below the maximum of 1000, but also has a liquidity factor of 0. This lack of liquidity, however, as noted by Cosmonaut, does not justify BitMex's current position. He said in the comments, \"Before you say anthing about liquidity factor, I could find 6 other exchanges in the top 50 that have 0 liquidity factor and have under 600 in web factor ranking. What a sham lmao.\"\nNeed for a Review?\nIs there a need to take a closer look at CoinMarketCap's new rankings? The confidence vested by the crypto community in CoinMarketCap must be well guarded. Now that questions are out on the credibility of their algorithms with respect to exchange rankings, a review may help to pacify investors who depend on their ratings to decide which exchange to leverage as they traverse through the crypto sphere",

However, O'Carroll already confirmed with Bloomberg that she had left the company.\n\"Radkl remains extremely well capitalized with its current investors and continues to grow rapidly,\" the spokesperson told Bloomberg.\nCohen is a Wall Street titan who also owns the New York Mets baseball team, and his support for Radkl had made top headlines last September. Additionally, his entry into the crypto sector was seen as a sign of the traditional finance world's increasing interest in the industry.\nHowever, investors such as Cohen have backed off from the crypto sector this year as there has been a slump in digital assets and a series of crises such as the LUNA crash.\nBesides Radkl, Cohen's other crypto investment included his family office - Cohen Private Ventures - involvement in a funding round last year for non-fungible token (NFT) firm Recur.\nAccording to Sept 2021 report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), a spokeswoman for Cohen had said that the investment in Radkl had come from his personal capacity and not through his hedge-fund firm - Point72 Asset Management LP.\nShe had further added that Cohen wouldn't be involved in the startup's day-to-day operations.\nThe WSJ also said that in August 2021, Point72's venture-capital arm had invested in crypto data and analytics provider Messari.\nDuring the heyday of the crypto industry last year, other hedge fund billionaires such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller also publicly embraced crypto, which further helped fuel a rally in digital currencies.",

    "content": "Alex Gladstein, an advocate for Bitcoin as well as the chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, is of the opinion that the cryptocurrency helps mend democracies that are broken and combats government corruption by limiting the capacity of governments to influence the citizens of their respective countries. In other words, Bitcoin makes it more difficult for governments to manipulate the citizens of their respective countries. Bitcoin, in other words, makes it harder for governments to control the people living in their different nations by making it more difficult for them to do so.\nDuring an interview that took place on the 20th of February, Gladstein expressed his belief that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin (BTC) may serve as a defense mechanism against tyranny and corruption. This conversation took place in the United States of America, which served as the location.\n\"I do feel that it is very simply related to fiat money, and I do think that Bitcoin answers this in some way,\" he added. \"I do think that Bitcoin answers this in some manner.\" \"In my opinion, there is a very clear connection between what you're describing and fiat money,\" you said. I have no doubt that Bitcoin will, in some fashion, figure out a method to overcome this obstacle. The author makes the claim that he thinks \"I do feel that the use of fiat money is very simply tied to the decline of democracy in those countries,\" and he is certain that this is the case.\nSince 2007, Gladstein has been working at HRF, a charitable non-profit organization, in which capacity he has held the position of chief strategy officer. The Human Rights Foundation is referred to by its abbreviation, HRF. The mission of the organization is to advance and protect human rights all throughout the globe, with a particular emphasis on countries in which the population suffers \"under authoritarian tyranny.\"\nIt is stated in Gladstein's profile that he often participates in events that are organized by Singularity University. During these occasions, he also gives speeches on topics such as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the development of future monetary systems.",

According to the press release shared with Blockchain.News, this uptrend will be fueled by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as they are viewing blockchain technology as an optimal solution for the numerous challenges they face, like access to bank loans, trade financing, and cash flow difficulties.\nBaaS cuts out middlemen\nSMEs are continuously looking forward to stamping their authority across the globe, but this necessitates considerable financial resources. BaaS is playing an instrumental role in simplifying access to different trade financing sources. Additionally, its decentralized nature is eradicating middlemen, making it favored by SMEs.\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) believes that blockchain technology can be pivotal in bridging the trade financing gap globally. Recently, the WEF asserted that blockchain should be viewed as the vaccine for future disruptions like the one triggered by the coronavirus pandemic in the seafood industry, hence showing its confidence in this technological innovation.\nSMEs are reaping the benefits in BaaS in supply chain processes as transparency, immutability, and traceability become inevitable.\nThe report also noted that the North American BaaS market stood at $1.01 billion in 2019 based on the significant number of blockchain development projects taking place in the United States. A market rise is expected in this region because BaaS solutions are continuously being integrated with public utilities services.\nOn the other hand, the BaaS sector in Asia-Pacific will be boosted by incredible blockchain investment by China, Japan, and South Korea governments.\nAdoption of BaaS solutions by Huawei and Microsoft\nMicrosoft and Huawei have been setting the ball rolling in implementing BaaS alternatives. For instance, Huawei executed a blockchain service powered by Linux Foundation’s Hyperledge Fabric 1.0 to assist companies in incorporating smart contracts in supply chains in April 2018.\nConversely, Microsoft’s Azure blockchain service was adopted in May 2019 to assist customers design cloud-based blockchain networks.\nBaaS is being viewed as the icing on the cake in many industries across the globe. For instance, leading fast-food chain, KFC recently opted for blockchain-enabled media buying and digital advertisements for its Middle Eastern customers.",

    "content": "The largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, topped $25,000 on Sunday for the first time since June, with data on Bitstamp’s exchange hitting $25,050, the highest level since June 13.\nThe benchmark cryptocurrency was trading at $25,012 at 11:20a.m. Hong Kong Time, up over 1.5% during the intraday, according to CoinMarketCap. Some analysts believe the bullish momentum is attributed to stimulation of the upcoming merge of Ethereum, while some suggest the bearish tone remains.\nCryptocurrencies struggled in the first half of the year due to high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s policy of raising interest rates, with the prices of other tokens such as Bitcoin falling by more than 50% from their peaks.\nThe lower-than-expected U.S. inflation data in the past week means that inflation is not as severe as imagined, so the Federal Reserve may take relatively moderate actions to control high inflation, and Bitcoin will rise accordingly.\nThe CEO of Microstrategy, one of the largest bitcoin holders, tweeted:\n“This week, the benchmark interest rate reached 69.5% in #Argentina. It has increased by 1750bp in two weeks. The official inflation rate has surged to 71%. It is expected to exceed 90% by year-end. #Bitcoin is more than an investment. Bitcoin is hope.”\nThe Bitcoin \"Fear and Greed index\" is back at neutral for the first time since April 2022.\nHowever, US \"economist\" Peter Schiff said the current Bitcoin trading pattern is still bearish.\nAs shown in the figure below, the bitcoin trend chart shows a double-headed and double-shouldered top. There is a rising wedge below the neckline. He said the current minimum support for bitcoin will be less than $10,000.\nCrypto analyst Il Capo believes that the top of this bear market rally is very close, with new lows likely to follow, while most altcoins have encountered significant resistance.\n“$25k reached, but no bearish signs yet on ltf. We could see another leg up to 25400-25500, but imo the top of this bear market rally is very close,” He wrote on his Twitter.",

    "content": "Aptos Labs, a blockchain startup, announced Monday that it raised $150 million in a Series A funding round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto.\nThe raise follows a seed round that Aptos conducted in March, bringing the company’s total funding to $350 million.\nOther investors, including Apollo, Griffin Gaming Partners, Franklin Templeton, Superscrypt, a16z crypto, and Multicoin, also participated in the Series A funding round.\nAptos disclosed that it plans to use the fresh funding to support further development of its programming language, Move, as well as its blockchain technology. Besides that, the firm said it would use the funds to expand its team further and continue developing ecosystem funds designed to attract developers and grow its community.\nAptos Labs, established by former employees who worked on Meta Platform Inc.’s collapsed payment system Diem, is building a Layer 1 blockchain that uses key technology from the ill-fated Diem project and its smart contract programming language Move. Such technologies were initially developed by the founding members of the Aptos team while at Facebook. Aptos is currently using these technologies as an open-source protocol to build a blockchain technology to rival blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, the second largest blockchain by market capitalisation.\nMo Shaikh, Aptos co-founder and CEO, talked about the development: “We’ve known for a while that, due to issues like outages and downtime, current blockchains are not fit for purpose when it comes to mass Web3 adoption. That’s why we’re building a blockchain to be the reliable foundation for Web3 that ushers in users from around the world to experience the benefits of decentralisation.”\nAptos aims to develop a reliable and safe smart contract programming language and blockchain network that will offer a superior experience for developers and users to keep their tokens secure.\nBased on such commitments, the firm is currently operating several testnets designed to reward developers for building its community ahead of a mainnet launch later this year. The firm recently announced a grant program planned to accelerate project growth in its platform.\nChris Dixon, founder and managing partner of a16z crypto, also commented: “Developers are flocking to Aptos for its speed and scalability, and as an entirely permissionless, open source, and community-governed blockchain, it’s also optimised for the creation of a new class of Web3-native applications.”\nIn April, Google Cloud became one of Aptos’s inaugural integration partners. The partnership is designed to enable developers to launch a node on the network within 15 minutes and start developing immediately.\nAptos has also partnered with several other firms (such as the NFT platform Rarible, video platform Livepeer, crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase) to test and build projects on the Layer 1 blockchain platform and smart contract programming language Move.\nMeta officially shut down its Diem stablecoin project in January following intense scrutiny from financial regulators. In February, Aptos Labs announced plans to bring the Diem blockchain back to life to develop the world's safest and most efficient blockchain.",

    "summary": "The Bitcoin price went on a wild ride over the weekend, the bulls pushing the Bitcoin price up to $12,100, before the world’s biggest cryptocurrency plunged back to $10,640 within a matter of minutes.",
    "content": "The Bitcoin price went on a wild ride over the weekend, with the bulls pushing the Bitcoin price up to $12,100 before the world’s biggest cryptocurrency plunged back to $10,640 within a matter of minutes.\nThe cryptocurrency world was at attention last week as the Bitcoin price surged past $11,300 on Monday July 27 after months of little price action. Over the weekend, things got more interesting as the Bitcoin bulls pushed the Bitcoin price past $12,100 on Sunday, only to see it lose 13 percent half an hour later and fall to $10,640.\nIn an article by Bloomberg on August 2, Rob Sluymer, Technical Strategist, Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC suggested that despite dropping $1700 in a few minutes, the Bitcoin market will continue on its bull run after needing a correction from being overbought. He added that the Bitcoin price is in for some interesting movements in the short term.\nSluymer said, “Clearing resistance at $10,000-$10,500, which coincided with the downtrend line from the late 2017 highs and first-quarter 2020 highs, established a higher high for Bitcoin confirming a new tactical uptrend.” He added, “In the short-term Bitcoin’s daily momentum indicators are overbought (as they are for gold), but beyond some very near-term choppy trading, Bitcoin is likely to continue to trend to its next resistance level at $13,800.”\nA popular cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker appeared to agree with the overbought assessment and highlighted that there were many indicators prior to the drop. Melker said that after such a strong Bitcoin price rally in a short period, the market was bound to stabilize from being overbought.\nMelker said in a tweet: \"A $1700 BTC hourly candle (mostly in a few minutes) on extremely high volume, including a similar sell-off on ETH in the middle of the night? Cool. There were bear divs everywhere as I mentioned.”\nBuckle Up Says Winklevoss\nSince Bitcoin plunged to almost as low as $4000 in the March Black Thursday crash, the Bitcoin price quickly recovered to around $9000 in May—where the price would slowly rise for the following months often stagnating.\nWhile the Bitcoin price action has been less than interesting until last Monday, the drop in volatility, as well as the Bitcoin price recovery since the crash, has added to institutional investment interest and maturity toward Bitcoin. In a recent tweet, Cameron Winklevoss stated that it was for reasons like the influx of capital from mainstream investors and institutions that this coming Bitcoin bull run will be dramatically different to any seen before.\nCompared to previous bull markets, the billionaire crypto philanthropist Winklevoss said that with the rise of infrastructure, the influx of capital, and better projects at hand, Bitcoin price is set for its next bull run:\nWinklevos tweeted, “The next Bitcoin bull run will be dramatically different. Today, there’s exponentially more capital, human capital, infrastructure, and high-quality projects than in 2017. Not to mention the very real specter of inflation that all fiat regimes face going forward. Buckle up!”",

    "title": "How Will Litecoin Perform in 2021?",
    "summary": "Litecoin has gained momentum since March 2020 but it is also trading significantly below its all-time high making the cryptocurrency a solid contrarian bet right now.",
    "content": "Will Litecoin Double Again by the End of 2021?\nLitecoin was developed and released in 2011 by Charlie Lee and has been one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap for the major part of the last decade. However, Litecoin’s market cap has recently witnessed a downturn and it currently ranks at number 16, at the time of writing.\nLitecoin, which serves as an alternative to Bitcoin, has certain significant differences that make it a more attractive choice. It has a faster block generation time which means that transactions through Litecoin can happen much faster when compared to Bitcoin. Further, Litecoin has a different hashing mechanism. Hence, mining Litecoin is a far simpler process when compared to the complicated and advanced Bitcoin mining process.\nOver the course of Litecoin’s price history, it has largely followed the trend marked by the price movement of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Until 2017, the price of Litecoin was largely dormant similar to other cryptocurrencies. However, it took off in 2017 thanks to the unprecedented bullishness of the cryptocurrency market, witnessing a rally of around 4000% in seven months that year.\nIn 2020, Litecoin more than tripled its market cap and touched a record-high of $388 in May but has seen a significant drop since then.\nNow, the question is whether Litecoin will return to these highs before the end of the year, or not. To draw our conclusions, we’ve relied on expert reports, fundamental analysis, as well as technicals. Investors should also note that predicting the price of Litecoin is much more difficult compared to other investment classes such as equities and bonds.\nFinder’s Panel Report\nFinder conducted a survey of 42 fintech specialists about the future prospects of Litecoin. This survey found that most experts believe that Litecoin will touch a price point of $266 by the end of the year. This would mark gains of around 50% from current levels ($177).\nThese findings were similar to other panels’ opinions on cryptocurrencies such as DogeCoin and Ethereum. DOGE is expected to hit $1.21 by 2025 while ETH is expected to touch $4,500 by December 2021.\nHowever, even though Litecoin is expected to witness price gains over the course of the year, the panellists believe that the digital asset is going to continue losing relevance to other cryptocurrencies. Most of them believe that Litecoin is never going to be back in the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.\nSeveral of these panellists believe that Litecoin has been irreparably hurt by Charlie Lee’s sale of his stake. A vote of no-confidence by the cryptocurrency’s own founder may have hurt the chances of Litecoin of being a serious contender in the cryptocurrency game.\nSolid Fundamentals\nLitecoin’s future looks positive when measured in terms of its fundamentals. Litecoin, as has been mentioned earlier, enjoys significant advantages over Bitcoin in terms of the blockchain technology backing it. Litecoin also charges lower fees when compared to Bitcoin making the former a good alternative to the flagship cryptocurrency in the future.\nFurther, Litecoin is witnessing increasing market acceptance and was recently added to Bitpay’s payments service. This means that users of Bitpay can now transact using Litecoin through the platform. With an increase in the number of partners and widespread adoption, the value of Litecoin should gain pace as we inch closer towards the end of 2021.\nRather than just being used for speculative purposes, Litecoin has the potential to become a real digital currency accepted by merchants around the world. If this happens, then the future value of Litecoin could easily grow exponentially from current levels.\nLastly, Litecoin has been noted to be less volatile when compared to other cryptocurrencies. This makes it an attractive investment choice for investors who are more risk-averse.\nTricky Technicals\nTechnical factors too need to be considered when judging Litecoin’s future near-term price movements. Analysis has found that Litecoin faces a major resistance level around the $200 mark. Moreover, the resistance is further exacerbated since $200 is also a major psychological block.\nIn case Litecoin manages to cross the $200 mark, it may see a period of high growth by the end of the year.\nFurther, social metrics do not seem to look too positive for Litecoin. Social volumes and weighted sentiment are lagging significantly behind May levels. Litecoin’s active addresses (24-hours) have also witnessed a strong drop.\nOverall, this shows that in terms of technicals, the outlook does not seem positive enough for Litecoin to double by the end of the year.\nWrap Up\nLitecoin’s price has picked up again over the past month. If the broader cryptocurrency market remains bullish, Litecoin could see some significant gains by the end of the year. However, it is highly unlikely that Litecoin’s price will double in this time frame. Investors looking towards Litecoin may find that it serves as a better long-term investment rather than for short-term trading purposes.",

    "content": "During the Covid crisis, casual investors started to swap stocks and shares and even golf for investment in cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin and other altcoins like Ethereum proving to be hugely popular.\nElon Musk continues to endorse cryptocurrencies on Twitter, and his company Tesla has invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin, amounting to a huge 7.7% of its gross cash position. Proving that some of the major stock market players believe Bitcoin has a huge future. But what will happen ten years from now?\nCoinList invited a team of experts to explore the future of cryptocurrency in a wide-ranging interview. The Pareto Principle, better known as the 80:20 ratio, is the idea that 80% of the market will be monopolised by 20% of the competition.\nWith thousands of different coins all vying for a market share and as many as 1,700 of them already “deceased”, is the crypto market headed for a modern-day Dot-com bubble? If so, which altcoins will be left standing in the event of a future crash?\nThe panel also considered the future of cryptocurrencies, with general agreement that they would revolutionise the financial system, as well as predictions that the recent current bull run would gather pace again in the second half of this year.\nThe experts also discussed the here and now, giving their price predictions for the end of June, which ranged from $25,000 to $500,000!\nThe panel consists of:\n· Jean-Yves Sireau – Founder and CEO of trading platform Deriv\n· Paul Sokolov – CEO of custody-free crypto wallet Guarda\n· Anna Chertoc – CEO of cryptocurrency exchange aggregator Swapzone\n· Lennart Clausen – Head of Trading at Scandinavian Forex and CFD broker Skilling\n· Pavel Matveev – Co-founder and CEO of blockchain-based payments platform Wirex\nYou can read the panel’s answers in the full article here.",

The blockchain protocol has been opened up to allow enterprises to built custom solutions.\nThe two enterprise-level blockchain applications have been applied to industries such as supply chain, human resources, leasing, and around ten other industries. The blockchain smart contracts have been used for over 1 million transactions involving contracts, and the company expects the number to grow to hundreds of millions in the near future.\nThe JD.com blockchain-based smart contract platform offers a one-stop service for high flexibility in signature management, framework management, contract management, contract framework, and online judicial services. The platform aims to cover most online business scenarios involving contracts and to offer governments and enterprises to be able to digitize these processes.\nIn April, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China recently made it clear that the scope of its new infrastructure includes technologies such as blockchain, 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies to upgrade the traditional infrastructure. Following the direction offered from the NDRC, JD.com is moving towards building a secure, efficient, and credible blockchain ecosystem to set the standard for the industry.\nThe e-commerce giant believes that blockchain technology has a huge potential to enhance supply chain transparency to ensure the quality and authenticity of their purchases. JD.com has already deployed its blockchain technology on over 50,000 products ranging from across over 700 brands.\nChinese institutions join China’s national blockchain committee\nThe Chinese central government has put together a national blockchain committee to work on setting industry standards. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued a notice on April 13 of the “Public Notice on the Formation of a National Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Standardization Technical Committee.”\nOther committee members include executives from well-known Chinese institutions, including Baidu, Tencent, Huawei, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, amongst others.\nChina to build ‘digital central bank’ infrastructure\nChina’s Central Bank, People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is planning to look into building a digital central bank infrastructure to improve the standards of financial services in the country.\nOn May 18, the Chinese Central Bank’s 2020 video conference on scientific and technological work was held in Beijing. The meeting focused on the technological achievements made in 2019, an in-depth analysis of the current situation and challenges, and the upcoming key plans for 2020.\nA three-year FinTech development plan was set out for the country in August 2019, and 2020 has entered its second year. The development of blockchain, the internet of things (IoT), big data, and other innovative business models will also be expected to drive the digital transformation of the financial industry and promoting financial technology in the country.\nChina has also taken an ambitious step to “maintain its leading position in digital currency technology,” as it remains the central bank’s current top focus. According to Zhongtai Securities, the People’s Bank of China expects to be in the world’s leading position in digital currency development, as it continues to strive for efficient research and development, as well as technical testing of digital assets.",

    "summary": "Prof. Aris Stouraitis presents how Master of Science in Finance (FinTech and Financial Analytics) offered by Hong Kong Baptist University strives to nurture interdisciplinary talents and he offers the top 5 career advice for graduates who wish to work in FinTech and blockchain industry!",
    "content": "In Part 1 of the interview, Prof. Aris Stouraitis identified lack of interdisciplinarity is the culprit of FinTech talent shortage in Hong Kong. Interdisciplinarity in FinTech refers to talents that are knowledgeable in both finance and technology. He presents how the Master of Science in Finance (FinTech and Financial Analytics) (“the program”) offered by Hong Kong Baptist University (“HKBU”) strives to nurture interdisciplinary talents, and he provides the top 5 career advice for graduates who wish to work in FinTech and blockchain industry!\nWe've noticed that the FinTech program by HKBU has one elective course in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Which area of topics will be covered in this elective course, and what are the learning outcomes?\nThe elective course of blockchain and cryptocurrency includes but not limited to the following areas:\n1) Foundation of blockchain in both technical and non-technical perspective;\n2) Rationale and applications of smart contracts and decentralized autonomous applications;\n3) The origin of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n4) Various use cases in blockchain applications;\n5) Security in blockchain and the importance of cybersecurity.\nFor our students, there are four learning outcomes for this elective:\n1) The ability to explain and the concept of blockchain and what promises blockchain technology provides;\n2) The ability to explain how blockchain technology has transformed different industries;\n3) How students can apply the knowledge to address the risks and challenges of businesses adopting blockchain technology;\n4) How blockchain technology is applied in the finance industry in the future.\nWhat is the practical assessment provided by this program? Because if the program is practical, it will help the graduates a lot in pursuing a career in the blockchain industry.\nFirst of all, the program is interdisciplinary. Our teaching staffs come from the finance or computer science field. We have many adjunct professors who are well-known industry practitioners. They tend to have computer science backgrounds.\nThere's a lot of interdisciplinarity in the program. Apart from academics, our industry practitioners have a better understanding of the daily blockchain applications and what are the applications and challenges that businesses face. Meanwhile, we are trying to provide internships for our students. They should be able to take an internship while they're studying the program and thus get some practical experience. Therefore, our program is focused on interdisciplinarity and employability. It's a more practical program rather than only abstract theories.\nIt's very interesting to know that cybersecurity and privacy is one of the core curriculums of the program. What is the significance of cybersecurity and privacy in fostering FinTech development?\nCybersecurity is going to be critical in FinTech. Take mobile banking as an example. If you are using mobile banking, you want to make sure that the transactions are secure. The demand for cybersecurity will increase when there is more online transactions in the future.\nFor privacy, it becomes increasingly important when corporates like Facebook access to a large amount of user’s data. How Facebook is going to use the data becomes the critical privacy issue for users. I think cybersecurity and privacy are gaining attention, and no one was paying too much attention to privacy before. Both governments and individuals start looking at privacy much more seriously.\nThere are more universities launching their FinTech program since 2018. How do you evaluate the program in HKBU against others like HKUST?\nThe universities in Hong Kong are setting up FinTech programs independently. I think in future, there may be more convergence of FinTech programs, or some universities may look for a particular niche within FinTech.\nOur program focuses more on employability. We think that the majority of our graduates want to find a job after graduation instead of studying for a Ph.D. It's both practical and theoretical as we have academics from the interdisciplinary background and industry practitioners in the program. Some of our courses provide internships for our students to gain practical experience. The core focuses are employability and practical applications.\nWe know FinTech is a fast-changing domain. How does the program keep up with the fast-changing pace in the industry?\nOur programs will be updated continuously in the future.\nThis is very important because, with a traditional program like corporate finance, you set up the program, and then the structure remains unchanged for the next 15 years.\nThis is not the case for FinTech. There is a need for these programs to be updated continuously. We just launch the program now, and I expect that we will update the program on an annual basis. With the fast-changing pace in FinTech, we need to review the curriculum, course offerings, and structure regularly.\nWhat is your career advice to graduates who wish to work in the blockchain industry or FinTech?\nThe opportunities in FinTech are going to be very exciting. For instance, we will have new virtual banks in Hong Kong, and they are looking for talents in this area. I have the top 5 career advice for graduates:\n1) Pay attention to interdisciplinarity\nWe need to be able to understand both the technical and financial sides. If you understand only one of the two, you will not be as competent as the others.\n2) Keep abreast of changes in regulation and compliance\nCompliance is very important in the banking industry nowadays. All FinTech applications will have to comply with regulations. I think graduates need to be well aware of the regulations in their field of FinTech and how things are changing.\n3) Learn more on cybersecurity and privacy\nI predict there will be surging demand on cybersecurity talents going forward. You need to keep abreast of the knowledge in cybersecurity and privacy.\n4) Beware of ethical considerations\nI believe that new FinTech applications are presenting ethical considerations which are not well understood currently. However, ethical considerations will be more important in the future. Let’s say we develop algorithms on algorithmic trading. For me, I don't purchase tobacco stocks because I think it's unethical. Do you train your algorithms not to purchase tobacco stocks or not to trade in a particular industry?\n5) Open to entrepreneurial opportunities\nIn the past, graduates worked in investment banks after their studies. With Fintech, people can develop their own applications and start their own companies! Be open to such opportunities and get prepared!",

    "content": "The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) has updated its guidance notes for distributed ledger technology (DLT) providers in the country. Per the announcement, the updated DLT guidance notes will help to assist both old and emerging firms while also protecting consumers.\nAccording to the GFSC, the initial guidance notes were first published back in December 2017 and the need for a revision stems from the commission’s interaction with stakeholders as well as the supervision of all major players utilizing decentralized ledger technology in the country.\n“The release of the updated Guidance Notes is another important step forward in the development of the DLT Providers Regulatory framework that has proved so successful to date. It is also a significant milestone in the evolution of our regulations as we embark on the road to achieve ongoing FATF compliance,” Albert Isola, Minister for Digital and Financial Services said in the press release.\nAccording to the GRSC, the amended guidance notes updates the risk framework to distinguish between virtual assets and virtual asset denominated instruments that are generally classified as higher risk and require additional factors or onboarding tests to be considered.\nBlockchain-Based Regulations are Getting Bolstered\nWith the growing blockchain and digital currency ecosystems, countries and regions around the world are putting forth regulations and revising old ones to accommodate the growing sector. Besides the recent update made to its DLT guidance notes by Gibraltar, the Australian state of New South Wales also proposed a flexible regulatory framework for blockchain technology back in July.\nWhile the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released its new regulatory framework to propel the growth of blockchain and digital currencies, US states including Hawaii have long charted a regulatory path for the promotion of digital assets in the region.\nIn a somewhat complementary manner, while some nations are gearing up to trail the blockchain and crypto growth, countries like India are devising means to clampdown on the growth of the digital currencies.",

The announcement was made on July 12, 2023, by Joseph Mills, the store’s group product manager, marking a significant step towards the integration of blockchain technology in mainstream gaming.\nThe updated policy enables developers to incorporate digital assets, including NFTs, into their apps and games. However, developers offering the ability to buy, sell, or earn tokenized assets must clearly indicate the presence of blockchain-based elements within the app on the Play Console.\nThis move is seen as an effort to open new avenues for transacting blockchain-based digital content within apps and games on Google Play, with a particular focus on enhancing user loyalty through unique NFT rewards.\nUnder the new guidelines, game developers must explicitly state if their game allows users to earn or buy NFTs or cryptocurrencies. The policy also prohibits developers from glamorizing potential earnings from playing or trading activities. Furthermore, the sale of loot boxes or any form of gambling is strictly forbidden.\nThe policy update does not affect the previous ban on crypto mining apps, which was implemented in 2018, or the removal of the Bitcoin Blast video game in 2020 due to deceptive practices.\nThe full rollout of the new policy is expected later in 2023, with the first tests of the new experiences anticipated in late summer.\nGoogle Play has had \"a variety of blockchain related apps\". Google Play has collaborated with several partners, including Reddit, known for its successful Avatar NFTs, to develop the new policy. The aim is to create a level playing field that promotes user trust and encourages responsible usage of blockchain technology.\nThis policy shift is seen as a clear indication of Google Play is embracing the adoption of blockchain and NFT.",

    "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has amended its maximum fundraising limit for Small and Medium Enterprises a move that will benefit smaller blockchain firms.",
    "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a review of its fundraising limit for small and medium-scale (SME) organizations which also includes funds raised through Initial Coin Offerings by blockchain companies.\nAccording to the official announcement made by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, the amendments seek to help small businesses to access more capital.\nIn the new amendment, the SEC has raised the funding limit under Tier 2 of Regulation A from $50 million to $75 million. The Regulation crowdfunding offering limit was also raised from $1.07 million to $5 million. The SEC also increased the Rule 504 offering limit from $5 million to $10 million and encourages offering issuers to leverage this extended limit to source funds from both state and regional investors.\nBlockchain-based companies particularly those with innovative products are often in need of funding to scale up their operations. Many firms have been reportedly known to have secured such multimillion-dollar funding but the current amendments will enable more small and medium scaled firms to have access to an even larger funding base.\nHester Peirce on Yet Another Move To Favor Crypto Firms\nHester Peirce is largely regarded as crypto Mum as she advocates policies that promote the growth of cryptocurrency companies. Besides the recent move to increase the capital raising limit by SMEs, the SEC back in February submitted the draft of a proposal seeking to give blockchain and crypto firms about three years exemption from the United States Securities Laws.\nThe current funding expansion is not the first time that the SEC will be making regulations that revolve around Initial Coin Offerings. The SEC has earlier made ICOs more inclusive by modifying its definition of an accredited investor to take account of not just an individual’s wealth, but also their education to qualify for investing in cryptocurrency ICOs, as well as mainstream capital market offerings.",

    "summary": "BNB Smart Chain's security enhancements in 2023 led to an 85% reduction in financial losses from security incidents, a striking contrast to the previous year's $1.1 billion losses.",
    "content": "The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) marked a considerable 85% decrease in financial losses due to security incidents in 2023, compared to $1.1 billion in the previous year. The total losses reported were over $161 million, indicating a major improvement in blockchain security.\nThis noteworthy reduction in losses is attributed to several strategic security measures implemented by the BNB Chain Core Development Team, including the proactive alert system of AvengerDAO, which played a crucial role in preempting scams and hacks. In 2023, AvengerDAO issued numerous alerts, such as around 3,500 Red Alarm notifications and 330 alert tweets, significantly reducing the impact of potential security threats.\nDespite the decline in financial loss, BSC experienced a 44% increase in security incidents year-on-year, with a total of 414 incidents reported in 2023, out of which 315 occurred in DeFi projects. However, the final quarter of 2023 saw a 64% decrease in fiat losses compared to the third quarter. This decline is further backed by a 51% reduction in hack incidents in Q4, dropping from 130 in Q3 to 86 in Q4.\nThe report categorizes the types of attacks and threats on BSC, with hacks constituting 50.72% of the incidents, closely followed by scams at 49.03%. Scams accounted for $87.9 million in losses, a 54% decrease, whereas hacks led to $73.2 million in losses, marking a 91% decrease.\nThe AvengerDAO's meter API played a significant role in this achievement by scanning over 1 million unique contract addresses and identifying 35,000 as high risk. Despite some missed opportunities for safeguarding projects, the initiative has been effective in mitigating threats on BSC. Comparing hack values between the two most recent six-month periods, there's been a substantial decline in losses: from over $713 million in the latter half of 2022 to about $34 million in the first half of 2023.\nThis positive trend in BSC's security landscape is also reflected in its vulnerability statistics. BNB Chain accounted for only 0.9% of the total vulnerabilities in the ecosystem based on TVL in Q1 2023. Furthermore, only around 9% of the estimated 2,000 active projects in the ecosystem were impacted in H1 2023.",

Fahad Almubarak, said that local banks and payment businesses would play a significant role in the CBDC project and its execution.\nIn 2019, SAMA was able to carry out the CBDC experiment known as \"Project Aber\" with flying colours.\nIt carried out this investigation in conjunction with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates in order to determine whether or not blockchain technology may play a role in international financial transactions.\nLate in the year 2020, the banks published a report detailing their research and coming to the conclusion that a dual-issued CBDC was technically viable for facilitating cross-border payments and presented a \"significant improvement over centralised payment systems in terms of architectural resilience.\"\nThere is no information available on the technology that underpins the Saudi CBDC; nevertheless, CBDC Tracker implies that it is built on the Hyperledger Fabric developed by the Linux Foundation.\nThe Atlantic Council, a think tank based in the United States, reports that as of right now there are 11 nations that have completely implemented a CBDC and 17 countries that are conducting pilots.\nThe vast majority of those that have already begun operations are located in the Caribbean, with the exception of one in Nigeria.",

The company added that only internal testing funds were impacted as the platform is still in beta testing mode.\nThe protocol has been suspended for a complete investigation, according to the NFT company.\nAccording to The Block, projects coded with Solidity are vulnerable to reentrancy. It allows hackers to force their smart contract to make an external call to an untrusted contract.\nFor this nature of the hack, Yajin Zhou - CEO of blockchain security company BlockSec - told The Block that the hacker deposited NFTs from a collection called Doodles, which were used to borrow wrapped ETH (WETH), tokenized versions of cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of the original coin.\nFollowing the deposit and liquidation of the position, the remaining Doodle NFT from the original collateral is returned back to the attacker.\nZhou added that hackers often liquidate the loan position as the value of the NFT left as collateral before the callback function was invoked isn't sufficient to cover the debt position. To tackle this, hackers typically rely on reentrancy as they are able to force through using borrowed WETH to buy more NFTs before the liquidation occurs.\nFurthermore, Zhou added that the hacker then used the Doodles NFT acquired with the initial loan as collateral to borrow more WETH. However, as Omni had failed to recognize this new position, the hacker could withdraw the NFTs without paying back the loan.\nAccording to The Block, data from Etherscan shows the attacker has already laundered the funds via a coin mixing service for private transactions on Ethereum called Tornado Cash.",

    "content": "The Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA), a group of 31 traditional banks operating in Pakistan, has signed off on the development of a blockchain-based Know Your Customer (KYC) platform. The move aims to strengthen the country's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) capabilities while countering terror financing – an initiative led by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\nAs reported by the Daily Times, the PBA signed a contract on March 2 to develop Pakistan’s first blockchain-based national eKYC banking platform. The Avanza Group has been tasked to develop the blockchain-based eKYC platform named \"Consonance,\" which will be used by member banks to standardize and exchange customer data via a decentralized and self-regulated network. This will enable banks to assess existing and new customers, and to share customer details based on consent.\nThe member banks of PBA include international establishments such as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank. The blockchain platform will improve operational efficiencies, primarily aimed at improving customer experience during onboarding.\nJoining other countries in the race to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Pakistan has recently signed new laws to ensure the launch of a CBDC by 2025. The SBP will issue licenses to electronic money institutions for CBDC issuance. \"These landmark regulations are a testament to the SBP’s commitment toward openness, adoption of technology, and digitization of our financial system,\" said Deputy Governor of SBP Jameel Ahmad.\nThe use of blockchain technology for KYC purposes offers numerous benefits to the banking industry, including reduced costs and enhanced security. The development of Pakistan's first blockchain-based national eKYC banking platform is a significant step towards the country's digitalization of its financial system. By standardizing and sharing customer data, Pakistan's banking industry will be better equipped to fight money laundering and terror financing while improving customer experience during onboarding.\nOverall, the development of the blockchain-based KYC platform demonstrates the PBA's commitment to providing its members with cutting-edge technology to improve operations and customer experience. The move also reflects Pakistan's willingness to embrace blockchain technology as a means of strengthening its financial system and combatting financial crimes.",

He is an elite in the sport and as of March 4, the star is currently detained and under investigation.

When questioned, it was revealed that he visited the country to endorse a community campaign promoting a foundation which supplied medical assistance to children in poverty.\nOn March 5, the Ronaldinho and his brother left the hotel, to give a statement regarding the case.

    "content": "Chairman of Roger Holdings and prolific American investor Jim Rogers warns that the trillion-dollar bailout will lead to an economic meltdown. Another legendary Wall Street investor, George Ball predicts Bitcoin will be the safe haven of choice.\nJim Rogers said that the recent COVID-19 emergency stimulus programs and central bank bailouts will lead to the worst economic meltdown of his lifetime.\nRogers' warning came in a recent interview, where he discussed the efforts of global central banks to stimulate their respective economies through the creation of trillions of dollars in currency. Despite the stock market now going back up and appearing healthy, Rogers predicts the bailout will ultimately end very badly in the long-term.\nRogers sees the US markets as a bubble that will pop when the US elections are no longer a priority. He said, “Remember there is an election in the US in six months in November and all those guys want to get re-elected. They do not care about you and me and our kids. They care about November and getting re-elected. So, all sorts of good things will keep happening and the markets will be ok for a while…”\nLiquidity Flood Will Run Dry, Bitcoin Will Rise\nWhile Jim Rogers has admitted in the past that he wished he had invested in Bitcoin in its earlier days, he said during the interview the he is putting his money in gold, silver and has bet on many of the industries that took a beating during the covid-pandemic—transportation, tourism and logistics.\nIn a recent interview with Reuters, George Ball the former chief executive of Prudential Securities and current chairman of Sanders Morris Harris said that despite being a long time Bitcoin opponent, he now sees Bitcoin as a safe haven asset following the United States government’s efforts to continue to stimulate the economy with liquidity.\nBall has joined the growing list of traditional financial industry experts to advocate for Bitcoin as a safe have asset and hedge against inflation. While Ball commended the efforts of the US government and the Federal Reserve and their attempts to offset the coronavirus pandemic’s disruption to the economy, he said, “The approach of the end of that road is going to be a lot closer by the fourth quarter than it is now and therefore both traders and investors should and probably will realign their portfolios substantially.\"\nWhile the impending collapse and debasing of the US dollar is currently being resisted by the Federal Reserve in its attempts to go digital with its central bank digital currency development and coming FEDNow digital payments platform, the news is a bullish indicator for the Bitcoin price and Ball predicts it will kick off on September 7, 2020.\nThe former Prudential Securities chief executive predicts that following September 7, Labor day, a migration will \"ignite\" from traditional finance to Bitcoin trading and hedging as citizens will look to secure their wealth in an asset that cannot be \"undermined by the government.\"",

    "summary": "Do Kwon and five others have allegedly violated the nation's capital markets law and have been issued a warrant from the court in Seoul. LUNA and LUNC both collapsed after the arrest warrant was issued.",
    "content": "Do Kwon, the founder of the bankrupt Terraform Labs crypto ecosystem, has been issued an arrest warrant from a court in South Korea.\nDo Kwon and five others have allegedly violated the nation's capital markets law and have been issued a warrant from the court in Seoul, the prosecutor’s office informed Bloomberg.\nKwon and the other five are all located in Singapore, Bloomberg reported citing the prosecutor's office. However, Kwon is yet to reply to an email sent by Bloomberg seeking comment.\nKwon's tokens, including Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC), collapsed massively after the arrest warrant was issued. LUNA was trading as low as $2.4964 at 3:55 PM HKT, down over 35.7%. Its market cap was down to over $347 million from over $555.12 million, while LUNC was trading at $0.0002716, down by over 22.3% during the Asia trading section, according to CoinMarketCap.\nTerra Classic is home to the algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (UST). It's now-renamed LUNC token collateralized UST, which crashed in a bank run in May.\nThe fall of the Terra Platform in May led to the historic collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoins, which has affected the faith of many people in the digital-asset sector. Currently, the crypto sector still remains rattled by the downfall of the stablecoin, and recovery is still under process.\nDo Kwon also helped create Luna as part of the Terraform Labs crypto ecosystem, which also lost its value during the fall of the ecosystem.\nThe ecosystem collapsed when TerraUSD - also known as UST - crumbled from its dollar peg and brought down the ecosystem he had built, after which, the prices of both tokens tumbled to near zero, a shadow of the combined $60 billion they once controlled.\nFurthermore, the collapse of Terraform Labs’ associated tokens - LUNA and the UST stablecoin - effectively ushered in the first wave of the crypto winter.\nTerra’s unravelling has triggered probes in South Korea and the US, as well as renewed regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins - digital tokens that are pegged to an asset like the dollar.\nCurrently, the probe into Terraform Labs by South Korean prosecutors is taking a whole new twist as watchdogs are making consultations on how best to classify the collapsed LUNA tokens - now known as Luna Classic (LUNC) - according to a report from Blockchain.News.\nAs reported by the Korean Herald, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office’s Financial and Securities Crime Joint Investigation Team is consulting with industry stakeholders to determine the best designation for LUNA coins, according to the report.\nFollowing the plummet in prices, companies who had exposure to the assets suffered such financial challenges that many, like Three Arrows Capital (3AC), could not recover from, the report stated.\nHowever, Do Kwon has committed to cooperating with the investigations when the time comes. Bloomberg reported that in an interview with crypto media startup Coinage that floated the prospect of jail time, Kwon said, “Life is long.”\nAccording to a report from a local media platform, the Yonhap news agency, Do Kown was subject to a \"Search and Seizure\" in July.\nThe raid was reportedly conducted on the operating office of 15 trading platforms and organisations that have connections to Terraform Labs. While the raid was not projected to last that long, the report had it that prosecutors were very focused on getting as much data as possible to bolster their investigative work on Terraform Labs.\n\"The amount of data requested by the prosecution was so enormous that it was impossible to complete the search and seizure within one day,\" one of the exchange’s officials said, \"If the data is insufficient while conducting forensics, it seems that it took time because the prosecution requested to extract more data through a data analyst.\"\nWhile the Korean Herald reported that South Korean prosecutors are broadening their investigations into the company. This move has stirred targeted raids on the home premises of Terraform Labs Co-Founder Daniel Shin as well as those of trading platforms that are suspected to have dealings with the now defunct company.",

The flooding impacted Bitcoin mining operations. Musk criticized the process of Bitcoin mining and pointed to its centralization in China as well as its environmental-unfriendly feature as being problematic. He said:\nFortune reported previously that the blackout halted about one-third of all Bitcoin’s computing power globally. Referring to BTC mining, a study showed that as much as 66 % of global hash rates come from and are controlled by Chinese entitles. The hash rate, a measurement used for the processing power of the BTC networks, dropped recently due to a regional blackout in North-Western China.",

    "content": "To protect the blockchain networks from eavesdropping and quantum computing attacks, JP Morgan Chase, Ciena, and Toshiba have shown the feasibility of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system in groundbreaking research.\nIn a statement, the research team disclosed that the QKD network can offer speeds of 800 Gbps for mission-critical blockchain applications irrespective of environmental factors.\nYasushi Kawakura, Toshiba America’s vice president, believes that the QKD project is a stepping stone towards averting quantum attacks on the blockchain ecosystem.\nThe QKD network is an integration of JP Morgan’s P2P blockchain-based network called \"Liink\", Toshiba’s proof of concept network infrastructure, and Ciena's Waveserver 5 platform consisting of 800 Gbps optical-layer encryption.\nTherefore, it is based on quantum physics and uses a solid two-way communication framework.\nMarco Pistoia, the head of the FLARE Research group at JP Morgan Chase, welcomed the strategic partnership and stated:\nGiven that the quantum computing era is on the horizon, Steve Alexander believes research and development are crucial for optimal results like Ciena’s first-ever 800 Gbps encryption.\nThe chief technology officer at Ciena explained:\nQuantum computers are still in the developing phase and are deemed superfast than standard computers.\nJP Morgan has been crafting a name for itself in the blockchain/crypto space. For instance, it created a business unit dubbed Onyx to house its digital currency and blockchain efforts.\nThe leading bank also recently set foot in the metaverse through a virtual lounge.",

    "summary": "Argo Blockchain increased its daily Bitcoin production to 5.7 BTC per day in February, up from 5.4 BTC per day in January, despite a 10% increase in network difficulty.",
    "content": "Publicly-listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Argo Blockchain has reported an increase in its daily Bitcoin production for the month of February, despite a significant spike in network difficulty. According to the operational update released on March 7, Argo mined 162 Bitcoin or BTC equivalents during the month, translating to a daily production rate of 5.7 BTC. This is a 7% increase from the 5.4 BTC per day produced in January.\nBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure that defines how hard it is to mine a BTC block. It requires more hash rate or additional computing power to verify transactions and mine new coins. In February, the BTC network difficulty surged to new all-time highs, hitting a difficulty rate of 43 trillion on Feb. 25, as per data from Blockchain.com.\nDespite the network difficulty spike, Argo's production rate has increased, thanks to the company's investment in new mining equipment and a focus on increasing efficiency. The news comes amid the industry anticipating the next Bitcoin difficulty adjustment expected to occur on March 10. According to data from BTC.com, the next difficulty is estimated to reach 43.4 trillion.\nArgo Blockchain sold its flagship mining facility Helios to Mike Novogratz's crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital amid the tough crypto market of 2022. However, despite the sale, Argo has continued to mine using Galaxy's facility, and its production rate has been steadily increasing. Months before the transaction, Argo's monthly BTC mining generated more than 200 BTC.\nArgo is not the only mining firm that seems unaffected by the BTC difficulty spike in February. Other miners like Cipher Mining produced 16% more Bitcoin over January, and Marathon Digital increased its average daily Bitcoin produced by 10% compared to January. However, Hut 8 mining firm saw its daily Bitcoin production rate drop from 6 BTC in January to 5.6 BTC in February.\nArgo Blockchain has been focusing on expanding its operations to capitalize on the increasing demand for Bitcoin mining services. The company recently announced plans to establish a Bitcoin mining facility in West Texas, which is expected to have a capacity of up to 200 megawatts and is slated to begin operations in Q4 2022.\nIn conclusion, despite the network difficulty spike, Argo Blockchain's focus on increasing efficiency and investment in new equipment has led to an increase in its daily Bitcoin production rate. The company's expansion plans and investment in new facilities suggest that it is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin mining services.",

    "content": "A consortium of Netherlands CBD producers called the Cannabinoid Association of the Netherlands (CAN) is leveraging blockchain technology to enhance traceability, accountability, and transparency in the CBD market.\nThis has been made possible by launching a free-to-use online search tool dubbed CanCheck.org, which enables consumers to track CBD products from seed to shelf with each production line verified using blockchain.\nThe group noted that any CBD product having the CAN quality mark could be easily traced and its components authenticated using the blockchain-enabled tool. Users are only required to key in the batch number that will instantly avail test results and the seed-to-shelf journey.\nAccording to HempFlax CEO Mark Reinders:\nThe blockchain-based system comprises a clear and consistent product content analysis undertaken by accredited laboratories. This guarantees authentic CBD levels, a full spectrum composition, and the lack of contaminants. The information provided also includes all the cannabinoids in a given cannabis plant other than just CBD.\nReinders acknowledged that blockchain technology was instrumental in offering consumer protection by guaranteeing product quality.\nHe noted:\nCBD products like CBD oil are beneficial in reducing depression and anxiety, common in mental health disorders that trigger devastating effects on a person’s well-being and health.\nRecently, Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said that global governments see blockchain technology as a stepping stone to addressing settlement and transparency. For instance, the US government is considering blockchain as one of the technological advancements that will boost traceability and food safety culture.",

    "summary": "The Pheu Thai Party in Thailand plans to give all Thai residents over the age of 16 a stipend of $300 in digital currency if the party wins the next election. The initiative aims to stimulate the local economy using blockchain technology.",
    "content": "The Pheu Thai Party, a major political party in opposition to the current prime minister’s party, has proposed a significant stimulus project using blockchain technology in Thailand. At an April 5 campaign event, the party announced plans to provide all Thai residents over the age of 16 with a stipend of 10,000 Thai baht, or roughly $300, in digital currency. The party’s candidate for prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, touted the initiative as a way to help the local economy, and said that blockchain technology would be used to facilitate the distribution of funds.\nThe plan is similar to the universal basic income initiative proposed by U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang in the 2020 elections, which aimed to provide eligible people in the United States with $1,000 every month. The Pheu Thai Party's initiative would provide a one-time payment of $300 to roughly 50-60 million Thai residents over the age of 16, which could cost the government between $14 billion and $18 billion.\nThailand's Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering a ban on staking and lending services, and has established stricter rules for crypto custody providers, despite crypto exchanges and trading generally being permissible in the country. Additionally, the country's central bank has warned investors about stablecoins pegged to the baht. However, the Pheu Thai Party's digital currency stimulus project has the potential to boost adoption of cryptocurrencies in Thailand, and could pave the way for further developments in the country's blockchain industry.\nThailand's next general election is scheduled for May 14, with all 500 seats in the country's House of Representatives up for grabs. Current Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha is eligible to hold his position until 2025, following a decision from Thailand’s Constitutional Court regarding his term limit. The Pheu Thai Party's proposal could have a significant impact on the election, and could influence voters to support the party's pro-crypto stance.",

    "content": "MicroStrategy Inc plans to increase its bitcoin holdings through the net proceeds of its sale of up to $500 million worth of its class A shares.\nThe Tysons business software firm indicated their plan in September 9 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It disclosed a sales deal with Cowen and Company LLC and BTIG LLC to sell those shares from \"time to time.\"\nSEC filings say the proceeds will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin.\"\nAccording to the company, the new stock sale deal will not require MicroStrategy to issue any minimum offering amount. It further indicated in public filings that it expects to spend some of the proceeds on bitcoin purchases, but it did not make any promises about holding onto those purchases.\n\"We expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, including with the net proceeds from this offering,\" the company wrote.\nThe firm \"may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments for treasury management purposes,\" the company wrote.\nAs of September 8, MicroStrategy held 129,699 bitcoins, whose market value at the time was worth well north of $2 billion.\nThe move has come a month after Michael Saylor - founder and Chairman of MicroStrategy - decided to step down as CEO.\nHowever, the company’s stock price is heavily affected by the rise and fall of the bitcoin price. The company has lost more than half its value since the beginning of the year — it stood at roughly $223 as of 3:00 pm Wednesday.\nIt is unknown how many bitcoin purchases the company has made since the end of June. However, it reported to the SEC that it had spent $10 million to buy 480 bitcoins between May 3 and June 28 - a small buy by the company’s standards.\nIn the first six months of 2021, MicroStrategy spent $1.6 billion to buy 34,616 bitcoins. According to SEC filings, the company purchased only 5,308 bitcoins in the first half of 2022.\nThe company has been looking to increase capital for bitcoin purchases over the past two years. In March 2022, a MicroStrategy subsidiary formed specifically to hold most of its bitcoin took on a $205 million loan to finance more purchases.\nThe company previously funded its bitcoin purchases with $1 billion in stock sales per an open-market sale agreement made in June 2021 with New York investment bank Jefferies LLC.\nThe total revenue of MicroStrategy for the second quarter of 2022 was $122.1 million - a decrease from $125.4 million during the same quarter a year earlier.\nWhile the company recorded a net loss of $1.2 billion compared to $409.4 million during the second quarter of 2021.",

    "summary": "Finnish authorities traced Monero transactions in the Julius Aleksanteri Kivimäki trial, highlighting challenges in tracking privacy-focused digital currencies, a significant development in cryptocurrency-related cybercrime investigations.",
    "content": "The ongoing criminal trial of Julius Aleksanteri Kivimäki in Finland has been marked by significant developments involving cryptocurrency tracking. Kivimäki stands accused of hacking into the database of Vastaamo, a private mental health firm, and demanding ransom payments in cryptocurrencies. This high-profile case has brought to light the complexities of dealing with crimes involving digital currencies, especially those designed for privacy.\nIn October 2022, Kivimäki allegedly demanded a ransom of 40 Bitcoin, approximately 450,000 euros at the time, threatening to release records of over 33,000 patients from Vastaamo. When his demands were not met, Kivimäki reportedly targeted individual patients. The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation has played a pivotal role in tracing the Monero transactions connected to this case, a notable achievement given Monero's reputation for strong privacy features, including Ring Confidential Transactions and stealth addresses.\nInvestigators found that Kivimäki received payments in Bitcoin, then transferred these funds to an exchange that did not adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. He subsequently converted these funds to Monero and moved them to a dedicated Monero wallet. Interestingly, it appears that the funds were later transferred to Binance, converted back to Bitcoin, and then distributed to various wallets. However, the authorities have maintained confidentiality regarding the specifics of their on-chain analysis.\nThis case underscores the challenges law enforcement faces in tracking transactions involving privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, which are designed to be untraceable and anonymize users completely. The ability to follow the crypto trail in this instance is significant and might set a precedent for future investigations involving privacy coins.\nThe case of Julius Aleksanteri Kivimäki highlights the evolving landscape of cybercrime, where digital currencies play a central role, and the ongoing efforts by law enforcement agencies to adapt and respond to these challenges. The implications of this trial extend beyond the immediate case, touching on broader issues of cryptocurrency regulation, privacy, and the balance between individual freedoms and the need for security and law enforcement efficacy.",

    "content": "International investors are throwing in money on cryptocurrency funds and companies as the Russia-Ukraine war has escalated, believing that the sector could provide security from the fallout of the war, according to Reuters.\nAccording to research firm Fundstrat's latest report, venture capital buyers have invested around $4 billion into the crypto space in February. While another $400 million worth of venture capital investments into crypto start-ups was made last week, Fundstrat's data showed.\nThe data further highlighted that the venture capital investments have been consistent with weekly investments in the crypto industry averaging between $800 million to about $2 billion since early this year.\nThe highest new crypto funds this year have been hit $3 billion, which was raised over the last two weeks.\nPaul Hsu, founder and CEO of Decasonic, said \"the conflict in Ukraine has weaponized our financial and digital economy and really accelerated blockchain adoption.\"\nHsu added that \"we are seeing a re-allocation to crypto and blockchain away from real estate and bond funds, for instance, because of higher interest rates. I've seen this with my funds but unfortunately, because I'm closed-end, I cannot admit more funds nor investors.\"\nBain Capital Ventures, a unit of private equity firm Bain Capital, said last week that it is launching a $560 million fund focused exclusively on crypto-related investment.\nAccording to Reuters, crypto-assets outperformed traditional risk-on assets during the crisis. Bitcoin rose 12.2% last month, while ether gained 8.8%. Since bottoming on February 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine, the digital currencies have gained 14.5% and 13.5%, respectively, while the S&P 500 rose just 3.2%.\nAccording to CoinShares' data, $163 million in new institutional money was put into crypto investment products and funds in the two weeks to March 4.\nThe data further added that $127 million of inflows were the largest seen this year until now.\nIn 2021, venture capital firms poured in $30 billion into the crypto industry - the highest amount in the past ten years, Blockchain.News reported.\nMason Nystrom, a research analyst at Messari, previously noted that as cryptocurrencies continued gaining steam, crypto company fundraising hit $8.2 billion in the third quarter of 2021.\n“Crypto attracted $30bn of venture-capital funding in 2021, more than in all other years combined. VC money almost quadruples previous high of $8bn in 2018, the year following Bitcoin’s 1,300% breakthrough gain,” said Market analyst Holger Zschaepitz.",

    "content": "BIS Research has presented a new market intelligence report dubbed ‘Global Blockchain in Energy Market - Analysis and Forecast, 2018-2024.’ It reveals that blockchain application in the energy market was worth $518.6 million in 2018 and its value will reach $6.29 billion in 2024.\nThe market growth witnessed is primarily linked to the increasing demand for decentralized power generation, coupled with the elevated integration of renewable energy sources.\nBlockchain is viewed as a booming market in the energy sector because of the distributed ledger technology it offers. Additionally, its combination with grid-interactive devices is speculated to considerably transform this sector.\nBlockchain frontrunners in the energy sector\nThe report reveals that nations, such as the Netherlands, Germany, the U.S., and the UK, are the frontrunners in blockchain application in the energy market. Other key countries in this category include Australia and Estonia.\nThe utilization of blockchain has instigated a wide range of market expansion opportunities in these nations.\nRakhi Tanwar, the principal analyst at BIS Research, acknowledged: “There have been significant investments in the blockchain in the energy industry for the last three years. The industry is receiving investment from high-profile individuals, financial investors, and major energy companies. In 2018, an amount of $466 million was invested in the industry, with 189 companies operating in the blockchain in the energy market.”\nBlockchain application in the energy sector is offering cost-effective strategies to households. As reported by Blockchain.News on Nov 8, Power Ledger, a Perth-based energy trading software company, and Powerclub, an Australian electricity wholesaler, have signed a deal to offer households unparalleled authority over their energy usage via blockchain.",

    "content": "The United Kingdom has appointed Rishi Sunak as its newest Prime Minister after much confusion in the ministerial office over the past months.\nAs reported, Rishi Sunak made it the third prime minister in the UK for this year, following the resignation of Liz Truss from the office last week. The newly appointed prime minister has brought a lot of excitement to many crypto enthusiasts as they hope this would mean the UK crypto market could advance more under Sunak’s regime.\nRishi Sunak is a former Goldman Sachs analyst who has also served as a chancellor between February 2020 and July 2022. In April this year, Sunak released a proposal aiming to make the U.K a crypto-friendly tech hub. In the proposal, Sunak encouraged the UK’s Royal Mint, the official maker of UK coins, to launch an official NFT collection of the nation – an idea some have criticized as a \"poorly judged gimmick.”\nHe also helped the U.K make plans on how the U.K government should regulate stablecoins so as to make them recognized as a legal means of payment in the country.\n“We want to see the businesses of tomorrow – and the jobs they create – here in the UK, and by regulating effectively, we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term,” said Rishi Sunak.\nPrior to Sunak’s leadership victory, Liz Truss, who is now the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announced her resignation, 44 days after assuming office on September 6.\nAs reported by Blockchain.News, Truss’s resignation was fueled by the errors in her proclaimed mini-budget and tax cuts that were announced by the former Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng.\nThe policy, at the time, riled the markets, with the stock market recording unprecedented slumps, a trend that also affected the British Pound.",

    "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver recently took to Twitter to share a video of a Hong Kong vending machine which accepts BCH and Ether as payment options but not Bitcoin.\nIn the video, Ver pointed to Bitcoin’s high fees and congested network as the reason it was likely omitted from the payment options. However, YouTube Bitcoin influencer Tone Vays and trader Willy Woo responded tweeting that it’s more likely Ver paid for Bitcoin’s exclusion.\nRoger Ver posted the video above of the Hong Kong vending machine transacting a BCH payment. He explained, “You’ll notice there’s Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Binance Coin and some other ones, but there is no Bitcoin at all because it's been broken.\"\nVer's Beef With Bitcoin\nVer has been outspoken on the topic of fees and network speeds in Bitcoin and believes Bitcoin Cash to be a purer version of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of the cryptocurrency. He has also very adamantly disapproved of the efforts of those seeking to solve Bitcoin's scaling issue by other means than larger blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain—which developers of the Lightning and Liquid Networks have called a dead end.\nVer’s frustrations at the advocates of the Lightning Network—Bitcoin’s most notable scaling solution—came to the forefront at Deconomy 2018 during his famous Bitcoin scaling debate with Blockstream's Samson Mow. Ver's main arguement is that Bitcoin is not close enough to a practical digital cash and should be a payment system on its own, while Mow argues that Bitcoin is actually meant to be a settlement system to build scalable payment solutions upon.\nTone Vays and Willy Woo Suspiscious of Roger Ver\nOne of the most popular traders in crypto and YouTube influencer, Tone Vays was not impressed by the video and suspects Ver may have paid for the Hong Kong vending machine to prefer BCH over BTC. Vays also questioned whether the Hong Kong vending machine had ever transacted in BCH since the demonstrative video.\nAnother popular crypto trader, Willy Woo admitted that his first inclination was to agree with Vays’ assessment. Woo claimed it was common for “lower tier altcoins to pay to get access to ATMS” and thinks the video raises red flags on centralization of the crypto space.\n— Tone Vays - TheFinancialSummit.com (@ToneVays) May 30, 2020\nVer has reportedly denied any involvement with the Hong Kong vending machines choosing Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin.",

    "content": "California's burgeoning cryptocurrency community is poised to play a decisive role in the 2024 elections. According to data from Coinbase, revealed through a collaboration with Morning Consult, an impressive 27% of Californians, translating to approximately 8.2 million people, are cryptocurrency owners. This significant demographic, known for their preference for innovation and disruptive technologies, could sway election outcomes, particularly favoring candidates with pro-crypto stances.\nThe Pro-Crypto Sentiment and Its Implications\nA notable 78% of California's crypto holders are inclined towards policies that foster innovation, with a similar percentage ready to support candidates who align with their pro-crypto and blockchain visions. This sentiment extends beyond state lines, mirroring a national trend, especially among younger voters. Approximately 51% of Gen Z and millennials across the United States express a likelihood to vote for candidates who are favorable towards cryptocurrencies in the upcoming elections.\nPolitical Engagement and Regulatory Desires\nThe crypto community's political engagement is not just about backing pro-crypto candidates; it also encompasses a call for clear and stable crypto regulations. This desire stems from the community's frustration with the current \"regulation-by-enforcement\" approach, which they find unpredictable and stifling for the industry's growth. The push for definitive regulations reflects a broader consensus among digital asset holders and advocates, emphasizing the need for a legal framework that nurtures innovation while ensuring investor protection.\nThe Election and Beyond: A Focus on Crypto-Friendly Policies\nAs the 2024 elections approach, the focus on digital assets and crypto-friendly policies is intensifying. Political figures and potential candidates are increasingly acknowledging the importance of crypto policies in their campaigns. The conversation around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and their regulation is expected to play a significant role in shaping the political landscape and policy decisions in the U.S., indicating the growing influence of digital asset owners in American politics.\nSummary\nThe intersection of cryptocurrency ownership and political engagement is set to have a profound impact on the 2024 elections in California and potentially across the U.S. As candidates and policymakers vie for the support of this influential voter bloc, the crypto community's preferences for innovation, technological advancement, and clear regulations are likely to shape future electoral outcomes and regulatory landscapes.",

Every Token is backed by a Voluntary Carbon Unit, VCU, a digital certificate issued by Verra, the international standards agency, which allows certified projects to turn their greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions into tradable carbon credits.\nUP Alliance Chairman, Matthew Le Merle:\nPowerful macroeconomic forces underpin the Voluntary Carbon Credit market and, according to some commentators, could drive up prices significantly as more countries introduce regulated CO2 markets, forcing companies to compensate for their pollution. Additionally, a growing number of firms and individuals are choosing to offset their carbon footprints voluntarily.\nCombating Climate Change with Tokenization\nUniversal Protocol Alliance’s vision is that every asset class will be digitized and tokenized.\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2020, humanity compensates for just 22% of global emissions through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits, and yet the proportion of countries operating regulated carbon markets has risen from 40 percent of global GDP in 2016 to 70 percent in 2020. The result is a wall of demand that may far outstrip the production of new carbon credits, which is choked by the slow and expensive process of Voluntary Carbon Project certification.\n“This year may go down as the key inflection point for climate change,” said JP Thieriot, Co-Founder of the UP Alliance and CEO of Uphold. “The year it went from a far-off issue enshrined in distant accords like Kyoto and Paris, to an existential threat affecting the lives of tens of millions of people. In recent months, we’ve seen Australia and California on fire, ever more powerful hurricanes, the US president-elect Joe Biden announcing a Climate Administration, and companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nike voluntarily committing to carbon neutrality.”\nThieriot added:\nVoluntary carbon credits, which back all UPCO2 Tokens, offer major economic advantages compared with regulated credits. As dollar-denominated, globally-recognized, fungible and perennial assets, voluntary credits last forever, maintaining option value, until consumed or retired by a company or an individual seeking to compensate for carbon footprint.\n“It’s astonishing that there is no single global clearing price for carbon emissions,” said Le Merle. “A non-deliverable, digitally-tradable commodity that’s essential for human activity shouldn’t be traded bilaterally on OTC markets, as carbon credits are today.One year-ton of carbon means the same everywhere. As a globally-recognized asset, defined by international standards, a Voluntary Carbon Credit should eventually fetch the same price anywhere.”\nMatthew Le Merle said:",

    "summary": "The Sui Foundation has redirected an additional 40 million SUI tokens towards ecosystem and community development, adding to the previous 117 million SUI, making a total of 157 million SUI. This reallocation aims to bolster the DeFi ecosystem of Sui Network, which has shown a significant uptick in total value locked, marking over 100% increase in the last two months. The initiative follows a series of remarkable achievements by Sui, underscoring its commitment to fostering a robust ecosystem for decentralized applications and financial protocols.",
    "content": "The Sui Foundation has announced a further allocation of 40 million SUI tokens towards its ecosystem and community development, as revealed in a tweet by Sui Network on 14th October 2023. This allocation comes in addition to the 117 million SUI reallocated in the preceding week, totaling 157 million SUI dedicated to fueling the growth of the budding Sui ecosystem.\nThe latest allocation of 40 million SUI is a part of Sui's ongoing efforts to steer resources towards enhancing its blockchain network and community engagement. This reallocation of tokens from external market makers is intended to propel the Sui ecosystem further, which has already been showing promising growth and usage.\nOn 5th October 2023, the Sui Foundation declared a reallocation of 117 million SUI from external market makers to various channels aimed at fostering the growth of the Sui Network. This Layer 1 blockchain, having launched its mainnet in May, has been recognized for its scalability and industry-leading throughput, making significant strides within a short span.\nThe tokens reallocated in these initiatives are envisaged to bolster Sui's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which has already demonstrated robust adoption. As per DefiLlama, a leading DeFi TVL aggregator, Sui Network recently recorded its highest total value locked (TVL) at approximately $37 million, marking a more than 100% increase over the last two months. This fresh influx of resources is expected to sustain and accelerate this upward trajectory.\nThe reallocation initiatives follow a series of remarkable achievements by Sui Network since its mainnet launch. Noteworthy among them is the network's execution of an industry record 65.8 million transactions in a single day, within two months of its launch, outperforming every other blockchain in history. The network also showcased its scalability as the cost per transaction remained unaffected despite the high traffic, indicating a well-optimized infrastructure.\nThe Managing Director of the Sui Foundation, Greg Siourounis, expressed optimism for what lies ahead. The recent reallocations are viewed as a pivotal move to provide a fresh impetus for the Sui community comprising builders, developers, and ecosystem participants, propelling Sui’s ecosystem growth in the ensuing months and beyond.\nSui is a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform designed to render digital asset ownership fast, secure, and accessible to all. Its distinctive model, based on the Move programming language, facilitates parallel execution, sub-second finality, and an array of on-chain assets, embodying a significant leap in blockchain technology.",

Alone, the worldwide blockchain market size projects to grow to $23.3 billion by 2023 hinged on an 80.2% compound annual growth rate. Market size totaled $1.2 billion in 2018.\nTangible and intangible asset management has also become more efficient due to tokenization and fractionalization across the crypto world. These endeavors present liquidity opportunities for assets not found in the traditional fiat world.\nProjects like Gleec focus on fostering the real-world use of cryptocurrencies through a range of products that streamline and simplify the ability to buy, sell, trade, and store digital assets. Following in the footsteps of the native Gleec Coin, the recently-introduced Gleec BTC digital asset exchange to speed up mass crypto adoption.\nGleec BTC’s Exchange: Building On Scalable Solution’s Software\nThe newly-minted Gleec BTC exchange allows users to trade the native Gleec Coin along with GLEEC/BTC, GLEEC/EUR, and BTC/EUR trading pairs. The exchange features an accompanying Google Play and Apple iOS app for users to access, according to the project’s team.\nLicensed in Estonia by the nation’s Agency of Economic Activities, the Gleec team utilized white label software from Scalable Solutions to craft the exchange.\nScalable Solutions, founded by Mark Berger, works with companies to harness technologies like Microsoft Azure with .NET and Open Source while focusing on product engineering services. Scalable Solutions is known across the crypto world for its industry-leading trading engine that has facilitated exchange growth.\nGleec CEO and co-founder Daniel Dimitrov remarks how “after listing Gleec Coin on exchanges that run on Scalable Solutions' infrastructure and starting to actively trade on them, we realized the potential of the underlying exchange technology. We then decided to replace our existing exchange infrastructure for Scalable’s in order to provide our wide user base with the best trading experience in the market.”\nThe Gleec BTC exchange will profit from deep liquidity and a modular technological approach that aids in scalability. According to the Gleec Team, the user experience remains a priority through traceability, guaranteed security, and steps to promote transparency as coins are bought, sold, traded, and stored on the exchange.\nPart Of A Stepping Stone Towards The Future\nIn the midst of launching the new Gleec BTC exchange, the native Gleec Coin is also listing on the Bittrex and Bithumb exchange.\nPlans also include a prepaid Visa Gleec Card that gives holders the ability to spend Gleec Coin in more than 40 million worldwide terminals.\nThree years after the launch of Gleec Coin, the team hopes the newly-launched digital asset exchange benefits the cryptocurrency community as a whole.",

As at press time, police had started hunting in places where the rate of electricity usage is subsidized.\nThe said spokesman claimed the new regulations that the activities of miners who use the national electricity distribution would be stopped during peak hours of usage which is roughly 300 hours per year.\nMore than three months ago, Iran launched a crackdown on illegal use of exorbitantly low electricity for miners of digital currency. And now, the new regulations have come to nail it.\nThose who establish their own mining plants would receive incentives from the government and the national network would support plants that use renewable sources if they have a failure while attempting to generate power.",

Tokyo, a rapidly growing blockchain gaming startup in Japan, announced on Wednesday that it has raised $24 million (3 billion yen) in a Series C funding round.\nThis round of funding was led by Jump Crypto, a unit of U.S. trading group Jump Trading, along with a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency trading startup Amber Group, Japanese venture capital firm Jafco, and South Korean video game developer WeMade as well as other ten angel investors, also participated in the funding round.\nDouble Jump mentioned that it would use the fresh funding to accelerate the development of new gaming titles with major video game companies.\nHironobu Ueno, the CEO of Double Jump.Tokyo, commented about the funding and said: “The 3 billion yen raised will be used to invest in the joint development of IP-based blockchain games with major game companies, as well as in the underlying products, partner companies, and decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO) projects.”\nGrowing Business through Partnerships\nFounded in 2018 by Hironobu Ueno, Double Jump.Tokyo has remained a proactive blockchain firm that develops games and NFT solutions for large-scale enterprises in the gaming and entertainment sector.\nDouble Jump was established just when the popular play-to-earn (P2E) NFT game Axie Infinity, a blockchain-based play-to-earn game, was starting to gain traction in Southeast Asia. In 2020, Axie Infinity exploded in popularity in the Philippines and other Asian countries where players could earn more than regular employment as Covid-19 destroyed jobs and forced many to stay home. While NFT gained wide recognition in 2021, its popularity and adoption continue to rise.\nSince 2018, Double Jump has been developing and operating blockchain P2E games, which allow users to trade in-game items and characters as NFTs to earn crypto coins. The company has an extensive track record in NFT game development and offers NFT technology solutions and has partnered with some of the largest gaming firms and IP holders.\nJapan is one of the leading content powerhouses in the world. Through media such as manga, anime, and games, the country owns many IPs worldwide, and new IPs are being created every day. Many development studios produce the world’s highest-level games in Japan.",

Rosie’s ascent into the Ripple board will help in the firm’s international expansion and in its pursuit of regulatory clarity in America.\nRosa has extensive experience in public policy and financial inclusion. While digital currencies were still in their infancy when she was serving as the US Treasurer, Rosa is a big believer and proponent of blockchain technology and committed to the innovations that can be birthed through them.\n“I’ve dedicated my career to financial inclusion and empowerment, which requires bringing new and innovative solutions to staid processes. Ripple is one of the best examples of how to use cryptocurrency in a substantive and legitimate role to facilitate payments globally,” said Rosa. “Blockchain and crypto will underpin our future global financial systems. Cryptocurrency is the what. Ripple is the how.”\nCrypto Firms Enticing Ex-Government Workers on a Massive Scale\nBesides Ripple, other blockchains and crypto-based firms are beginning to draw in the services of former government officials to pilot their affairs. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market capitalization weeks ago appointed former Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks, as the CEO of its US Subsidiary Binance.US.\nIn a move also similar to Ripple’s, former SEC Chair Jay Clayton also joined digital asset investment firm One River Digital Asset Management as one of its policy advisers in navigating the US regulatory landscape.",

Through the report, the blockchain forensics team encouraged law enforcement to be vigilant and said:\nFirst clue: look at phones and old computers\nThe blockchain analytics firm encouraged investigators to scrutinize confiscated phones and old computers for cryptocurrency-related apps. It also said that bookmarks and authenticator apps were worth investigating. Furthermore, the report listed a number of popular cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, and maps of cryptocurrency ATM locations that could aid law enforcement in their investigations.\nCipherTrace advised that “old, disconnected, and seemingly non-functioning computers could also hold the private keys to cryptocurrency wallets.”\nRandom papers may have crypto passwords\nIn addition, “pocket litter,” which was essentially little pieces of seemingly random paper, could easily be dismissed by investigators.\nHowever, the blockchain analytics firm suggested that they were worth a second look, as pocket litter sometimes provided the recovery seed phrases for crypto wallets, or were actually Bitcoin ATM receipts.\nThe report read:\nCipherTrace said that sometimes, recovery seeds could be hidden in books, planners, notes, or even displayed in plain eyesight in certain instances, concealed as regular lists. A list of hardware wallet manufacturers and popular models were also provided in CipherTrace’s report, and analysts warned that sometimes, “hardware wallets can look like inconspicuous USB sticks.”\nThe key is to remain vigilant\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrency analytics firm advised law enforcers to remain vigilant to red flags that could indicate that cryptocurrency was being used to launder criminal funds. It elaborated:\nWho is CipherTrace?\nCipherTrace is a blockchain intelligence and analytics firm that prides itself on fighting crypto crime fueled by Bitcoin and other digital assets. Founded in 2015, its mission is to put an end to digital crime and to protect financial institutions from money laundering and crypto-related threats. CipherTrace is funded by the US Department of Homeland Security and delivers software products that enable blockchain forensic analysts to trace miscellaneous transactions.\nFor law enforcers, these tools are essential for verifying whether crypto exchanges have been compliant with local anti-money laundering policies and for tracing fraudulent crypto transactions on the blockchain.",

    "content": "Felix Mago is the CEO of Dash Thailand, and has been working in the blockchain space since 2014 and one of the driving forces of cryptocurrency adoption in Thailand. He is the author of the “Bitcoin Handbook” and the co-founder of the Dash Embassy Thailand as well as the co-founder of Futerio, a southeast Asia based gateway to blockchain, ICOs, and OTC brokerage.\nWe first met Felix Mago in Block Live Asia in April. After an interesting conversation. we realized that Dash’s adoption was far beyond from what we’ve seen in Venezuela. Mago also revealed the 4 key strategies of Dash Thailand in government collaboration, millennials engagement, remittance market and upcoming scalability milestone.\nWe were delighted to meet Mago again at Next Block Asia in Bangkok, where he shared with us the recipe for Dash’s global expansion: the Dash NEXT and more updates from Dash Thailand.\nOn and off-ramp for Dash/Thai Baht\nOne of the topics we discussed with Mago in our previous interview was the rapid changes in financial regulations being established in the Thai market which has now led to more options, such as the ability to trade Dash versus Thai Baht. Mago said, “Prior to these new regulations, one of the limitations we had been consistently coming up against was that many of our onboard merchants didn’t really want to hold cryptocurrency because of the risks in volatility, indicating to us that Thai merchants needed easier on-ramping and off-ramping to leverage Dash.” He explained, “With the changes in regulation, we are able to bring a new group of customers to local services whether they be laundry, hospitality or financial, really anything. The money paid by customers could be in crypto but it will be converted and appear in the merchant’s bank accounts as Thai Baht, which has eased most merchants’ concerns.”\nMago and his team have been primarily working on implementing Dash cryptocurrency in Thailand from two angles—the user activation side and the merchant adoption side. Mago illustrated, “We have had a mixed strategy from the beginning. The first step was actually establishing the ecosystem from the ground up as no crypto-payment system existed in Thailand. We ultimately want people to be able to come to Bangkok and be able to rely solely on crypto for purchases and secondly, we would like every merchant to have the capacity to exchange in cryptocurrency as well.” Converting every merchant to cryptocurrency was never a really scalable solution and Mago expressed that they would need to partner with the big industry players. Being in Thailand, it was obvious to Mago which industry should be tapped into first, he said, “Our first focus was to partner with a major player from the tourism industry and POS (Point-of-Sale) systems. Once a crypto been adopted by a POS systems you have access to over 10,000 merchants at once which will foster further adoption.” Dash NEXT: Fostering crypto adoption in Asia and beyond\nAfter successfully establishing a Dash merchant network in Thailand the team created Dash NEXT with multiple global integrations and exchange listings. While Mago is very proud of his work with Dash Thailand, he and his team quickly became aware of the limitations that the name inspired when speaking with potential business partners. He explained, “The reality is that many of these partners are not just local to Thailand and do business throughout Asia and indeed globally. When creating partnerships, you must offer a value proposition and the value we were bringing often got lost in our name.”\nTo combat the perception, Dash NEXT is being established as the brand name for the company’s global business partnerships arm. Mago commented, “The fact is that our team is the only company for Dash cryptocurrency business development in Asia, we are the people on the ground, attending the events and establishing the network. We are doing business in Asia for Asia and in the global ecosystem.” He added, “For example, if we onboard a travel platform who is based or registered as a company in Singapore, we are more than happy to partner with them. And through the partnership, we can provide the whole world with a service for booking hotels in USA, in Australia, in Japan or in Singapore. It really won’t matter where, all that matters is that the hotels have a business connection with us.” Dash NEXT has onboarded two hotel platforms XcelTrip and Hotelier Mart in September 2019, gaining access to over 1.5 million hotels and 400+ airlines worldwide.\nThe sky appears to be the limit for the expansion of Dash throughout Asia, however, each country presents its own unique standards of fiscal compliance. Once again, Mago believes the solutions is having the right partners. Mago said, “You need to make partnerships, such as the example of POS systems which gives us access to 10,000 merchants across the region. We have just signed a partnership with a company called WisePass which is a multi-merchant service that offers you rewards in the form of points when you spend using the Wise Pass Card. These points can be used for discounts or special offers with Wise Pass merchants. They are based in Singapore but they also provide services to Vietnam and Thailand. We have also partnered with Blucon.io to launch 2 million Dash branded debit cards and public transport cards in Korea, which are linkable with Digifinex and other crypto exchanges in the future. So to summarize, our strategy is to find partners who are localized but who also have an international network in their business model.”\nDash Investment Foundation\nThe Dash Investment Foundation is a very new initiative at Dash and at the time of this interview, they had only recently voted to establish their board of governors.\nSpeaking to the initiative, Mago said, “Basically 10% of all our generated revenue is invested back into the Dash core and this is done by all teams around the world. Besides this, there has always been a discussion about investing in companies to enhance the speed of crypto adoption, or to fund companies that are doing new and interesting things that we would like to be a part of.” He continued, “We wanted to avoid just giving money which they would use to eventually do their own thing away from Dash. We wanted to build in a type of equity, where the companies would promote Dash through some type of leveraging of our technology and perhaps bring us in as shareholders. In return we would essentially loan them capital for investment or for scaling and to launch their business.”",

    "content": "Over 70% of Argentines see cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin as the most effective way to hedge against inflation and store financial value, according to Paxful research.\nThe global peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace, Paxful recently released a survey on the potential of crypto in Argentina focused on investor sentiment and habits and found a vast majority saw crypto and Bitcoin as a way to protect their finances.\nAccording to the Paxful Argentina survey on Aug 28, the majority of participants, 73.4% to be exact, believe that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are the most effective way to protect their funds in the current economic scenario which has been greatly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEconomic Shelter\nPaxful’s data was obtained through an online survey and the sample consisted of 1113 respondents, aged 18 to over 55, with a predominance of the male gender. The findings show that Argentines welcome new forms of investment like Bitcoin to protect their financial savings due to the economic crisis.\nMagdiela Rivas, Paxful’s Latin America Manager said:\n“During this year we have observed a major increase in the operations carried out by Argentine users on our platform, especially since the pandemic started, registering an increase of 37.5% in the volume compared to the previous periods.”\nFrom the respondents, just under 70% reported that they had invested in cryptocurrency at least once with 42.7% citing their most common reason as being to provide economic shelter against inflation.\nThe findings show that for most to the respondents, cryptocurrency has allowed these citizens to remain safe from the rising inflation and close almost 70% believe Bitcoin and crypto to be an extremely safe investment.\nAs it specifically pertains to Bitcoin, the survey participants who have invested reported that they did so for three major reasons—53% invested through an evaluation of Bitcoin’s global potential; 50.6% for its decentralized protocol; and, 49.1 % for its ability to act as a safe haven against government monetary policy and centralized banking systems.\nLearning Curve\nAmong the respondents to Paxful Argentina’s survey, the major reasons for those who had not invested in crypto at all (30.5%) in majority said it was due to a low understanding of digital currency and Bitcoin (24.2%)—indicating that there is still a learning curve for Argentina’s citizens.\nMagdiela Rivas, Paxful’s Latin America Manager said:\n“We know that the crypto industry offers many opportunities that people still don’t know about. At Paxful we are working to educate citizens and show them that there is a new alternative to invest their money, which gives them financial freedom.”\nRussians Use Bitcoin to Escape Banks\nFinancial freedom from monolithic banking systems via cryptocurrency has been a common theme in recent studies.\nAnother recent study by Paxful peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace at the end of July, released some important data regarding the use of its p2p trading platform in Russia.\nFor several years, Russian lawmakers have been contemplating whether to legalize or ban cryptocurrencies. As a result, they created an atmosphere that has left the entire crypto industry in the nation in an uncertain state. Despite these hindrances, Russian users joining Paxful cryptocurrency exchange have risen by 350% over the last 12 months.\nAnton Kozlov, Paxful’s manager from the Russian market, said that:\n“Crisis aside, Russia has always had a monolithic banking system that is dominated by a few players, and the sentiment we get is that Russians are increasingly looking to find alternative ways to grow their earnings and participate in the financial markets.”",

The collaboration of the project is between Gateway services and Australian company, ShareRing.\nThe expectation from the Thai officials is that the ‘eVOA’ system will benefit tourists from India and China during the early stages of their visa application process. Moreover, it is an ever-increasing trend to transfer from paper-based systems to online methods. Travelers coming into Thailand will no longer need to bring physical documentation to ports of entry, for example, flight tickets, hotel bookings, and identity proof.\nAt present, the initial testing period is unclear; however, the success of the ‘eVOA’ may encourage accommodating more foreign entries into Thailand and adopting the system in other countries.",

    "content": "A United States grand jury indictment has been delivered to Plexcoin founder, Dominic Lacroix, as well as Yan Ouellet and Sabrina Paradis-Royer for securities and wire fraud, according to the DOJ.\nThe United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced recently that a Cleveland grand jury has delivered a five-count indictment in the PlexCoin initial coin offering (ICO) scam charging Founder Dominic Lacroix and two other employees with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering activities.\nAccording to the announcement from US Attorney Justin Herdman, the indictment was delivered to Dominic Lacroix, Yan Ouellet, and Sabrina Paradis-Royer who are all based in Quebec, Canada. The indictment alleges that the trio conspired to sell PlexCoin tokens to investors from May 2017 to December 2017—offered through PlexCorps.\nThe DOJ asserts that the three defendants planned to make themselves rich by duping unwitting investors into purchasing the cryptocurrency through PlexCoin’s ICO—which raised around $8million dollars in PlexCoin tokens.\nAccording to the indictment, around June 2017, PlexCorps began promoting PlexCoin to the public as a new digital cryptocurrency that would be available through an upcoming ICO. Around August 2017, PlexCorps published a whitepaper for PlexCoin which was available for review on the internet by potential investors. The Whitepaper contained numerous false claims, including that some investments in PlexCoin could result in a 1,354% return.\n\"While technologies and the means to make investments may change, one thing remains constant – securities fraud ruins lives and deprives victims of their hard-earned money and savings,\" said US Attorney Justin Herdman, \"Digital currencies are a new type of investment, and just like with traditional securities, you should take the time to research and know exactly what you're getting into before making any type of investment.\"\nLacroix had been Warned\nPlexcoin founder Lacroix had been ordered by the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in Quebec not to go ahead with the launch of the ICO in July of 2017. He defiantly proceeded the following month and was sentenced to two months jail for contempt of court ruling. He was also served with a $110, 000 fine.\nIn December 2017, PlexCoin subsequently came under fire from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The US regulator moved to seize Lacroix’s assets in another attempt to halt the fast-moving ICO fraud which had raised $15 million dollars from investors by falsely promising incredible returns of up to 13 times the investment in a very a short period of one month.",

Ooki DAO in 2021 was used to govern the protocol as part of a decentralization effort.\nThe suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\nThe CFTC accused Ooki DAO of using its structure to evade regulatory oversight in its complaint.\n\"A key bZeroX objective in transferring control of the bZx Protocol (now the Ooki Protocol) to the bZx DAO (now the Ooki DAO) was to attempt to render the bZx DAO, by its decentralized nature, enforcement-proof. Put simply, the bZx founders believed they had identified a way to violate the Act and Regulations, as well as other laws, without consequence,\" the CFTC said.\nThis move by the CFTC also proves that DAOs are not immune \"from enforcement\".\n\"The bZx founders were wrong, however,\" the agency stressed. \"DAOs are not immune from enforcement and may not violate the law with impunity.\"\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ooki DAO has been identified by the CFTC as \"an unincorporated association comprised of holders of Ooki Tokens.\" They are liable in the suit.",

    "content": "Invictus’ assets under management (AUM) blew past expectations, growing by 29.46% to $145 million over June. The impressive success seen throughout Q2 2021 can largely be attributed to the funds offering investors downside protection during harsh market conditions, therefore preserving capital during sharp drawdown events.\nThe Invictus team has implemented dynamic cash hedging mechanisms and alternative yield-generation trading strategies to limit capital loss and earn additional yield. As a new wave of regulatory uncertainty struck the cryptocurrency market and forced prices down, the simple average return across the suite of seven Invictus funds remained positive at 9.85% for Q2 2021. This represents an outstanding annualized return of 45.61%.\nEssentially, Invictus has been providing investors with peace of mind even when extreme fear took over the cryptocurrency markets. Invictus Capital funds became a hedge against the heightened emotions that often lead individuals to exit what can otherwise be considered great investments. Both the Crypto10 Hedged (C10) and the Margin Lending (IML) funds continued to post steady returns, with the former increasing by 4.99% and the latter achieving an annualized return of 15.42% to see the quarter through.\nLikewise, the Hyperion VC Fund (IHF), renowned as the world’s first tokenized venture capital fund, saw its net asset value (NAV) rise to $0.4705. The upswing represents a whopping 89.90% appreciation for the quarter, equating to a 515% return since inception.\nThe Gold Plus (IGP) and Emerging Markets Solar (EMS) funds also rose by 4.86% and 4.16% respectively. IGP outperformed the ultra-popular and globally-traded GLD ETF, despite the weakness that the spot gold market has experienced since mid-2020. Both of these alternative funds successfully achieved their mandate as the Invictus team implemented arbitrage opportunities and capitalized on the strengthening U.S. dollar.\nWhile the performance of the Invictus portfolio of funds speaks for itself about the value that Invictus Capital brings to investors, their team of world-class analysts, academics, and industry experts continues to research ways to better serve their community of investors.\nTo further improve access to the Invictus Investor Portal, the team is launching the Invictus Capital Mobile App in October 2021, allowing investors to manage their investments from the palm of their hands. In conjunction with this, they are also incorporating several enhancements to the Invictus Wallet, where users are able to custody their investments on the platform. Users can now view all transactions in the Invictus Wallet and control gas prices to limit the occurrence of “stuck” transactions. These features enable greater customization of transactions with the ability to cancel those that are pending.\nMoreover, the Invictus Yield Vault will provide users with a new way to earn additional yield by loaning out their cryptocurrencies. One of the main features that stand out from the Invictus Yield Vault is the ability to maintain a fixed competitive high-interest rate for the duration of the crypto asset loan regardless of the market conditions. Lenders would now have a fail-safe opportunity to enhance their returns.\nInvictus Capital is now well-positioned to take advantage of the capital appreciation for which digital assets are known best while maintaining a solid foothold in traditional markets. The continued scaling of funds’ yield-generation tactics is expected to keep delivering additional upside to their investors.\nFor a full update on Invictus Capital and its fund offerings, please see the quarterly report here.",

He said:\n“They’re worried about what the central banks, and in particular the Federal Reserve, is going to do about the next recession.

This includes revenue to the artist, income loss amounting to 2.7 billion USD annually, and taxable income to the government.\nBlockchain is not a new addition to this space, with many artists and companies implementing new security features to fight crime and allow content creators full rights and income for their work. The solution is well discussed, but the process has been slow.\nAcross the entire entertainment industry, there have been problems in monitoring and fighting against illegal and criminal actions stealing and duplicating artistic work, but little progress in countering the problem effectively.\nWidespread piracy, including software piracy has continued to affect many industries, but with blockchain being tested to combat fraud, has it, or will it be able to make a difference?\nWhat has happened to date?\nFrom 2007 to 2016, Imogen Heap, a famous British songwriter and artist was one of the first active celebrities to look into blockchain technology and what it could provide in the music industry. Using Ethereum, she was able to directly sell her music without the need for intermediaries or centralization. Her main goal was to allow musicians and other entertainers to have control over their works, including credit, terms of usage, transfer, and purchasing.\nSince her initial involvement in blockchain, Heap has gone on to create a nonprofit company for artists called Mycelia, to realize a vision of the future, this premium digital identity standard enables music makers to control and manage their data through the creation of a verified database which contains discographies, personal information, acknowledgments, works, and business partners. Unique to each person, it promotes template‘smart contracts’ to speed up payments and encourage meaningful creative and commercial partnerships. Helping any level of the artist, get their songs off the ground, and also find alternative means to publish their work for sale.\n“The first thing is to create some kind of hope that there is an alternative to a major label deal and that it’s coming, but it's not quite there yet. Everybody is in a bit in limbo,” said Heap. “We’ve got this new technology, great possibilities ahead of us, but we’ve got this old cranky system trying to cling on to the remainders of [its] power.”\nHeap has continued to pave the way herself, touring in 2019 she has just completed her latest show, across Europe and America.\nDuring 2019, for six months, Heap has aimed to bring more people into the space to showcase blockchain technology through concerts, talks, workshops, and digital marketing.\nHeap further added, “Thanks to everyone we’ve collided with; it has been a fantastic adventure over the last six months with my family, the band, and the team in and around the shows, conferences, and workshops we’ve done so far.”\nMoving further into 2020, it is clear that we need more artists like Heap to grow awareness and adoption for blockchain, after years of efforts, small steps forward are fantastic for an old industry, showing that there is a chance for change in an industry that has outdated models, and a lack of fairness and protection for artists.",

    "content": "It has been revealed that the centralized finance (CeFi) platform known as Voyager Digital has been selling its assets via the cryptocurrency exchange known as Coinbase. Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. On-chain data suggests that Voyager was paid a minimum of one hundred million dollars in USD Coin (USDC) over the course of three days beginning on February 24.\nAccording to the assertions of the on-chain expert Lookonchain, Voyager has been sending cryptocurrency assets to Coinbase on an almost daily basis since Valentine's Day. According to the findings of the inquiry, Voyager moved millions of dollars using a variety of cryptocurrency tokens, such as Chainlink (LINK), Ether (ETH), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) (LINK). In spite of what seems to be a sell-off, Voyager still has about $530 million worth of cryptocurrency in its possession, with the greatest amounts held in Ether (about $276 million) and Shiba Inu (about $81 million).\nThe purported sale of money takes place at the same time as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has expressed concerns over Binance.acquisition US's of over one billion dollars' worth of assets that had belonged to Voyager. The SEC has raised concerns regarding the legality of such a transaction, and as a result, they have objected to the acquisition. Additionally, they have requested additional information from Binance.US in order to determine whether or not the transaction is in compliance with the regulatory requirements.\nVoyager Digital has suffered a significant setback as a result of the bankruptcy petition that was filed in July 2022, and the company has been making efforts to reorganize its finances ever since then. It is widely acknowledged that the selling of its assets on Coinbase is a key step for the company to acquire funds and remain operational. On the other hand, a number of industry professionals have voiced their worry over the effect that such a massive sell-off would have on the cryptocurrency market and the possible repercussions that it will have for investors.\nIt is not yet clear what lies ahead for Voyager Digital and whether or not the company will be able to emerge victorious from its current financial predicament. Despite this, the decision to sell assets on Coinbase is indicative of the company's proactive actions to solve its financial issues and seek new opportunities for development.",

This move seeks to offer unparalleled traceability, efficiency, transparency, and security to the worldwide rice market worth a whopping $450 billion.\nRicex offers a digital platform powered by the blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) for purchasing and selling rice.

Additionally, the platform enables them to arrange for inspection, shipping, insurance, and settlement.\nInefficiencies in the rice market\nDespite rice being one of the most traded agricultural products globally, it is profoundly marred with inefficiencies. For instance, paperwork characterizes transactions occurring in the market, and they are deemed slow and erroneous.\nFurthermore, the presence of a wide range of rice is another challenge because each strain differs in fragrance, taste, and quality.\nBlockchain platform to streamline the rice market\nThe blockchain platform availed by Ricex seeks to revamp the highly fragmented rice market by injecting new levels of efficiency and trust. As a result, it will create immutable and authentic data for all stakeholders, such as regulators, insurers, inspectors, shippers, sellers, and buyers.\nFor instance, buyers will be able to search for certified rice, and this will maximize their satisfaction rates.\nThe head of the Fujitsu Blockchain Innovation Center, Frederik De Breuck, noted:\nAdditionally, the DLT structure will eliminate delays and frictions in the supply chain making transparency and security inevitable in the rice market.",

    "content": "Leading crypto exchange Binance announced the launch of its new product 'Binance Card' which aims to provide crypto payment services anywhere in the world.\n\"The Binance Card does everything a regular payment card does, plus much more. It works like a regular debit card issued by your bank – which, in this case, is your Binance.com account. You simply top-up your card with funds through the Binance Card App in the form of Bitcoin or BNB, and you're ready to go,\" read the Binance blog post.\nThe Binance Card is issued by VISA and 46,000,000 offline and online merchants across 200 regions and territories. The Binance Card app will soon be available which will allow users to manage their funds and card security.\nThe 'physical' Binance Card hasn't been issued yet. However, the 'virtual' Binance Card is available in a beta version. Binance users can expect the 'physical' Binance Card in their hands within the next few weeks. According to the blog post, the Binance Card will be first rolled out in Malaysia followed by Vietnam and then further to other countries.\nTo avail the 'Binance Card' service, customers will need to the landing page and then download the Binance Card App. A one-time upfront fee of $15 will also be needed to be paid for the 'physical' Binance Card via the Binance crypto wallet. Apart from the upfront $15 fee, there are no hidden or monthly charges for the Binance Card.\nThe CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) in early 2016 took part in an AMA Session (Ask Me Anything) and hinted on the Binance Debit Card. \"We're not in a plan to offer a Binance credit or debit card just yet. We're working with other third-party partners to enable those. So yeah, we're looking for partners too, in those areas,\" said CZ back in 2016.\nHowever, Binance is not the only exchange who came up with such a concept. In April 2019, Coinbase launched a similar product in the U.K. The Coinbase Debit card is currently not accessible in the USA but can be used in 29 other European counties.",

Dactyl managed to solve the cube with two of its fingers tied, wearing a rubber glove, and being hit by a stuffed giraffe. OpenAI themselves were quite surprised by the result:\nBefore anyone starts screaming that this is the dawn of Skynet, however, OpenAI said that Dactyl only managed to solve the cube 60% of the time and “only 20% of the time for a maximally difficult scramble.”",

Although the said report showed that the country’s blockchain regulations are well suited, it pointed out the need for improvement, which explains the series of amendments already submitted by the Council March 2019.\nDuring the consultation process, the proposal from the council was reviewed, revised, and improved in so many ways as a consequence of the suggestions and recommendations received in the process. The new legislation is to serve as a blanket framework. All the participants in the consultation process welcomed the Federal Council's proposal in principle, which the Council will examine for the first time in the first quarter of 2020.",

    "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) investigation into Telegram’s $1.7 billion initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018 has revealed that some very big names took part in the unregistered offering.\nAccording to a court document, one of the investors was Russian oligarch and Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich who bought tokens (grams) via an offshore fund.\nThe Russian tycoon’s name, along with the amount he invested, was recorded in the document by Stephen Mckeon, a professor at the University of Oregon who was hired by Telegram to write a report on the Telegram Open Network (TON) project.\nAbramovich appeared to get involved in the second round known as Stage A in March 2018. Telegram raised another $850 million on top of the same amount raised in the first round.\nThe SEC and Telegram\nAlthough reports did surface in 2018 suggesting that Abramovich had invested in the first round, Telegram kept the names of the ICO investors secret, and the investors were additionally prohibited from talking publicly about their participation.\nIt was only when a court filing initiated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) compelled Telegram to reveal bank records and other transactional documents showing how the raised funds have been used in the last two years that the blockchain project.\nThe filing stated: “Plaintiff respectfully moves to compel Defendants to answer questions and provide documents regarding the amounts, sources, and use of funds raised from investors in connection with the unregistered sale of securities at issue in this case, Defendants are now refusing to disclose the bank records concerning how they have spent the $1.7 billion they raised from investors in the past two years and to answer questions about the disposition of investor funds.”\nIt was in the Telegram funded report by Mckeon, that the SEC discovered that the TON ICO received $10 million from Norma Investments Limited, a fund based in the British Virgin Islands which the regulator has identified as being controlled by Abramovich.\nAbramovich is best known as the owner of Premier League contenders Chelsea Football Club and is alleged to have intimidated his former business partner into selling him the controlling share of their joint oil venture.\nRuling Before TON Mainnet Launch\nThis investment row between the United States SEC and Telegram is based on the premise that Telegram did not register their Gram tokens as securities.\nThe TON network was scheduled to go live and launch last October, but the SEC filed a lawsuit just prior tot he deadline. The suit was highly contested by Telegram who asked the US courts to overrule the regulator’s action, they were denied. After the months of exchanging legal papers, the sides met in court on Feb. 19.\nThe presiding judge has promised to rule on the case before the new deadline for the TON mainnet launch of April 30.",

    "content": "China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) also known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) will not compete with China’s digital payment giants WeChat and AliPay according to a prominent CBDC researcher.\nThe clarification was made by Mu Changchun, Head of the Central Bank’s Digital Currency Research Institute who noted that there is no basis for any competition as the DCEP is a currency while both WeChat Pay and AliPay provide wallet services.\nChangchun said,“They don’t belong to the same dimension. WeChat and Alipay are wallets, while the digital yuan is the money in the wallet,” and further suggests that both wallet service providers will become useful as some users may decide to make use of them later in the future.\nChangchun said that the use of digital yuan is distributed through a government-owned app or a private app depending on the user.\nWang Leilei, a fintech consultant at Kapronasia said:\nWhile the DCEP is already in limited supply particularly in the city of Shenzhen wherein about 10 million (US$1.5 million) worth of digital yuan being awarded to residents, Changchun has noted the possibility for counterfeit DCEP wallets to be in circulation.\nThe Chinese CBDC project has progressed with the digital yuan finally being deployed to people for real-world spending. While the move has been seen by analysts as an impressive one, some of the residents of Shenzhen who got the digital yuan are actually not so impressed with the currency.\nAs we await the rollout of the digital yuan in other cities and provinces of China, the People’s Bank of China has drafted amendments to the extant banking laws in order to recognize the digital yuan while suppressing the emergence and circulation of any yuan pegged stablecoin that may present competition.",

    "title": "Ripple CEO Urges US Regulators to Embrace Crypto as Country Risks Falling Behind China",
    "summary": "CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has disclosed how China has taken the lead in blockchain and crypto as the US risks losing out.",
    "content": "Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, recently said that the US regulators should listen to the crypto sector, particularly after news shows that China is approaching the launch of its own digital currency. Garlinghouse is the CEO of Ripple Labs, crypto and blockchain company, behind the world’s third-biggest cryptocurrency XRP by total market value.\nGarlinghouse posted a comment on Twitter saying that currently is the perfect time to enter the digital money industry. He mentioned that the US lags behind and is being pushed out of competition as China is becoming stronger day by day in cryptocurrency and fiat payments. He revealed that the US regulatory authorities have stood still for too long, stating that now is that time to improve and promote innovation.\nUS Risk Losing Competitiveness\nBrad Garlinghouse disclosed that as the US remains disinterested in the innovation of digital currencies, China’s grip on both fiat and crypto payments becomes stronger. US congressional members received calls on the digital dollar, but nobody from the government or the Federal Reserve has yet made a positive response. Garlinghouse has, therefore, criticized the attitude of the US.\nGarlinghouse once again calls on the US regulators to embrace blockchain and cryptocurrency innovations as the nation is lagging behind China in terms of the digital currency and blockchain innovation. China has continued making significant progress in the development of its digital yuan, to the extent of carrying out real-world pilot tests of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in some cities. Such digital currency trials involve partners such as Starbucks, Subway, and McDonalds and are being conducted in four major cities of China.\nAs the US trade tension with China hitting a fever pitch, Brad Garlinghouse is urging US regulators to lean into digital currency innovation so that to be able to compete with China. The digital currency initiative has been in the works for more than five years now, and China’s central bank is getting closer to make it a reality.\nGarlinghouse said that China’s digital currency will have a major impact on the global economy. Many industry experts also believe that China’s digital currency could be a real threat to the already weakened global dominance of the US dollar. In China, more than 1.2 billion people or more than 80% of the population already utilize their smartphones to pay for goods and services digitally.\nChina can use its digital yuan to achieve faster remittances and far-reaching improvements at home. But a true sense will become when China brings the digital currency into business and economic relations with foreign nations.\nIn the recent past, Bitcoin bull and multiple billionaire Mike Novogratz also criticized that the US will lose the leadership in the fintech and blockchain area if the local regulatory authorities continue opposing innovations in this area. Already, China’s president has emphasized on many occasions that the use and acceptance of digital assets and blockchain will be crucial for the nation’s continued supremacy.\nRipple Expands Global Regulatory Team and Joins Blockchain Association\nGarlinghouse has been a strong advocate of regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP. An earlier report showed that Ripple Labs was the initial crypto-related firm to open an office in Washington, DC so that to develop closer relations with lawmakers (local regulatory authorities). In October last year, Ron Hammond, Michelle Bond, Susan Friedman (former senior advisor to CFTC), and Craig Phillips (former advisor to the US treasury department) joined Ripple’s board of directors. Ripple included these prominent leaders into its board of directors to help the San-Francisco-based blockchain and crypto company to offer a unified voice that would assist in building close partnerships with financial institutions, regulators, politicians, and executives from the fintech industry to drive forward blockchain and crypto adoption.",

It has come back down to $31.51 at the time of writing.\nGoogle Cloud announced on Twitter that besides the validator, the tech giant is also working to add its Blockchain Node Engine to the Solana chain in 2023.\nThe Blockchain Node Engine is a \"fully-managed node hosting service\" that already supports the Ethereum blockchain.\nGoogle Web3 product manager Nalin Mittal at Solana’s Breakpoint conference in Lisbon said, \"we want to make it one-click to run a Solana node in a cost-effective way.\"\nGoogle further added that it has initiated a move that will \"make it easier for the Solana developer ecosystem to access historical data\" by indexing Solana data and adding it to its BigQuery data warehouse.\nAccording to Mittal, the feature will launch in the first quarter of 2023.\nMittal also added that \"select startups in the Solana ecosystem\" has been chosen to try its credits program. There are up to $100,000 in Cloud Credits available for applicants, he said.\nGoogle Cloud introduced the Blockchain Node Engine in late October to help Web3 developers build and deploy new products on blockchain-based platforms.\nThe latest on the list of firms leveraging blockchain technology functions is Google, with its newly released Blockchain Node Engine aimed at helping web3 development.\nPer the company's announcement, the new solution was debuted to cater to developers' needs instead of using self-managed nodes that are quite tasking and require consistent management.\nWeb3 firms who feel the necessity for devoted nodes can now use Google Cloud’s Blockchain Node Engine to relay transactions, deploy smart contracts, and read or write blockchain data with the expected dependability performance and security from Google Cloud compute and network framework.\nBlockchain Node Engine is a fully managed node-hosting service that can minimize the need for node operations.\nAccording to Google, Ethereum will be the first blockchain the Google Cloud’s Blockchain Node Engine will support so as to allow developers to deliver fully managed Ethereum nodes with secure blockchain access.\nDevelopers who use the Blockchain Node Engine can benefit from a more straightforward and faster deployment of new nodes with a specified desired region and network (mainnet, testnet), said Google.\nIn addition, the Blockchain Node Engine would offer security configurations that can help turn aside unapproved access to assigned nodes. It would also provide fully managed operations by allowing Google Cloud to actively monitor and restart the nodes when needed during an outage.",

    "content": "Hong Kong Land Holdings Ltd (SGX: H78) announced Wednesday that the real estate firm has signed a lease contract with a crypto firm, embracing the first crypto company to use their offices in the city's central business district (CBD).\nHong Kong-based HashKey Group, a blockchain solution and an end-to-end digital asset management firm, will move to one entire floor in Three Exchange Square owned by the Hong Kong Land. According to the press release, the new office occupies over 10,000 square feet, which is \"the first digital asset financial service group move to Hong Kong Land’s central portfolio,” the real estate firm said in the statement.\nThe statement added that the leasing agreement will commence on Thursday, 16th Sep., which “brings traditional financial institutions with blockchain and virtual assets firm in one ecosystem,” the statement added.\nPrior to the relocation, HashKey locates at Cyberport. Michel Lee, Executive President at HaskKey, said the company is glad to move to the centre of the business community.\nHong Kong Land, meanwhile, also welcomes HashKey’s latest move as well:\nCentral is considered the traditional CBD in Hong Kong, mainly dominated by conventional financial institutions and other business corporations. In 2018, crypto trading platform BitMex leased one of the floors of the Cheung Kong Center, according to Bloomberg.\nYet, the rent has significantly dropped amid the pandemic of Covid-19. The rent has fallen by 26.4 per cent from their peak in the second quarter of 2019, which provides an incentive for some firms to return to the core region, according to local media South China Morning Post, citing experts said.\nWith the trending development on cryptocurrency, Hong Kong Financial regulator, The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), continues to strengthen its supervision over the crypto sectors. Last month, SFC warned of a high risk against Initial Decentralized Offerings (IDOs) or Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) as Unauthorized Investment Schemes. Earlier this month, a senior official of SFC stated that the authority is obligated to crack down on unauthorised crypto transactions while properly developing crypto. The administration said it should protect investors' interests from being deceived or facing fraud by illegal crypto activities.",

    "summary": "Market experts have debated whether the outcome of today's US presidential election will affect the crypto industry.",
    "content": "As today marks a crucial date in US history with 2020 presidential elections ongoing, crypto experts have pondered on whether the outcome of today’s political race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will change anything for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry.\nMarket sentiments seem to be divided on whether the US presidential elections will affect the crypto realm. Historically, US presidential elections have been known to have a direct impact on traditional stock markets, according to Forbes analysts. In fact, it appears as though stock markets have a history of performing better when current presidents are re-elected, as compared to new administrations.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have typically been reported to surge in tandem with traditional stocks. However, with Bitcoin’s recent bull run, market experts have concluded that the mainstream cryptocurrency has finally been decoupling from traditional markets, as BTC has managed to perform bullishly while US stocks have plummeted.\nBitcoin unaffected by US elections\nBitcoin recently surpassed the 14K mark today for the second time this week and seems to be gaining momentum as of late. Currently, it has fallen back slightly to record $13,885.59 on CoinGecko.\nMany institutions have turned towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as hedges, with the depreciation of the US dollar. Aside from US elections, institutional mass adoption of BTC from corporate giants such as MicroStrategy, Grayscale, and Square has served to bolster the positive sentiment investors have towards cryptocurrencies, potentially converting more retail traders to onboard the digital asset.\nIn an email to Blockchain.News, Head of Research at Blockchain.com and top UK economist Dr. Garrick Hileman disclosed:\nOne thing is for sure: regardless of the outcome of the presidential elections, Bitcoin may likely undergo a surge when the second round of stimulus packages roll out. As the US dollar continues to depreciate with the mass printing of fiat for stimulus COVID-19 relief, this may direct investors’ attention towards hedges such as Bitcoin to secure their funds in the midst of global economic uncertainty. Hileman said:\nHe added:\nWhat about US crypto regulations?\nHowever, in terms of cryptocurrency regulations in the US, it appears that it has been criticized for its lack of a clear regulatory framework. For example, the cryptocurrency enforcement framework released by the US Department of Justice drove Ripple founders to contemplate moving their company headquarters to a more crypto-friendly space such as Japan.\nCurrent president Donald Trump has also stated time and again that he was no fan of cryptocurrencies, as they are too volatile in his opinion. He previously said, “Unregulated crypto-assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…”\nAs for Joe Biden, the presidential hopeful has not broached the topic of cryptocurrencies in his political campaign, although his political campaign has jokingly said it would not adopt Bitcoin following the Twitter hack that saw Biden’s account frozen.\nAt the time of writing, Biden is leading in ballot votes, but the race is tight as it is 224-213 in favor of Biden.\nAn update of the US presidential race is expected for 23:00 EST (4:00 GMT).",

    "content": "Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard believes Bitcoin is unable to function as an inclusive currency for the world’s unbanked as the cryptocurrency is too volatile and lacks transparency.\nThe CEO of payments giant Mastercard believes that central bank digital currencies (CBDC) will be far better suited to drive financial inclusion than, Bitcoin which he say is still too volatile.\nSpeaking at the Fortune Global Forum on Oct 27, Mastercard’s CEO said that Bitcoin’s lack of transparency in its origins was a concern along with its extreme volatility make it unsuitable for empowering the unbanked. However, the CEO said that central bank digital currencies are a different story.\nRegarding Bitcoin, Banga said:\nThe Mastercard CEO also revealed that the payment giant has a large library of patents relating to CBDC. In addition, it was also announced in September that Mastercard has launched a virtual testing platform to allow central banks to evaluate use cases and test roll-out strategies for CBDCs by simulating a CBDC ecosystem.\nBitcoin remains of the table as a potential solution to financial inclusion as far as Banga is concerned. The Mastercard CEO claimed that the landmark cryptocurrency value was too unstable, and gave a crude example of BTC’s price volatility pertaining to how much coca-cola one could buy changing from one day to the next.\nThe Mastercard CEO explained:\nBanga reiterated that a digital version of sovereign digital currencies would be much better suited to help with cross-border finance.\nMastercard’s CEO Banga has not ever been known as a fan of cryptocurrency or their lack of regulation and transparency and was reported as calling Bitcoin and crypto “junk” in 2018 by the Times of India—stating that crypto should not be considered a medium of exchange.\nHowever, Mastercard has shown public support for digital fiat currency. In 2019, Senior MasterCard executive Ari Sarker told the Financial Times that if governments look to create national digital currency the payment’s giant would be very happy to look at those more favorably than cryptocurrency. Sarker said at the time:\nMastercard Holistic Approach to Digital Currency\nDespite Banga’s reported hostility towards cryptocurrency—in September 2020, Mastercard’s Blockchain and Digital Assets Lead for the Asia Pacific, Ashok Venkateswaran told Blockchain.News that Mastercard is taking a “holistic” approach to digital currencies. The payment giant is looking at everything from central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin, as well as stable coin options.\nAfter revealing that Mastercard has over 90 blockchain-specific patents—the Venkateswaran said that as one of the most recognizable payment systems on earth, despite its interest, Mastercard works with regulation and many for crypto, the regulations have not yet been in place.\nAn important way to increase adoption of new payment technologies and digital currencies in the mainstream, according to Venkateswaran is by changing the regulatory environment:",

    "summary": "As crypto ETFs gain SEC approval, Coinbase Custody emerges as the trusted custodian for digital assets, leveraging advanced security and regulatory compliance.",
    "content": "Coinbase Custody, a vital arm of the leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has been increasingly recognized as the custodian of choice for a number of recently approved spot bitcoin ETFs, setting a new standard in digital asset safety. With the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighting these ETFs, the focus on how digital assets are stored and protected has intensified, and institutional investors are taking note of Coinbase's robust safety measures.\nA Proven Track Record of Security\nCoinbase's custodial service boasts a zero-tolerance policy for errors, reflecting over a decade of secure asset management. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase Custody securely held $193 billion in digital assets, highlighting its capacity to safeguard large-scale holdings. This level of security results from employing world-renowned applied researchers and investing substantially in cryptographic key-sharding techniques, physical security, and strict operational controls.\nStrict Regulatory Compliance and Auditing\nAs a fiduciary under New York state law, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (CCTC) is subject to stringent regulations by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), bolstering its credibility. In addition, public company status mandates regular audits, ensuring client assets are managed with utmost integrity. These measures are complemented by SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II examinations, which affirm that Coinbase has appropriate controls to protect client assets and the security of the platform.\nInsurance and Legal Segregation of Funds\nUnderstanding the importance of financial protection, Coinbase maintains a robust commercial crime insurance policy, which is deemed to be one of the largest in the industry, covering theft from both hot and cold wallets. Client funds are legally segregated, which provides bankruptcy remoteness, ensuring that custodial assets are insulated from the financial status of Coinbase or any other client.\nIntegrating Custody with Efficient Trading\nThe institutional-grade custody service provided by Coinbase is designed to mesh seamlessly with the operational needs of ETF providers and institutional clients. With integrated trading and settlement capabilities, clients can efficiently manage their assets, benefit from advanced trading algorithms, and access customized execution strategies.\nCommitment to the Crypto Economy\nEmphasizing its dedication to the crypto space, Coinbase offers custody for over 400 assets across 38 blockchains. Their service extends beyond simple asset holding, enabling clients to engage fully with the cryptoeconomy, including earning rewards through staking and participating in governance decisions.\nExpert Leadership\nCoinbase Custody's success is partly attributed to the expertise of Alan Leung, the current CISO, who has been leading the business since 2018. With a background in cybersecurity, Leung's experience with reputable institutions such as Blue Cross Blue Shield and Citibank plays a crucial role in maintaining and advancing the platform's security measures.\nAs the world of digital assets continues to evolve, Coinbase's commitment to safety, compliance, and innovation makes it a key player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, ensuring that as the market grows, the safety and security of digital assets remain in capable hands.",

The initiative aims to facilitate the seamless exchange of trade documents across various platforms and blockchains, reducing fragmentation and inefficiencies. The collaboration uses Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol for security and interoperability, paving the way for smart contract, blockchain, and AI applications.",
    "content": "Vodafone's Digital Asset Broker (DAB) and Chainlink (LINK) Labs have unveiled a proof of concept (PoC) in collaboration with Sumitomo Corporation and InnoWave. This initiative aims to tackle the inefficiencies entrenched in the mammoth $32 trillion global trade arena.\nThe core of the demonstration lay in the fluid exchange of pivotal trade documents across varied platforms and blockchains, a process often hampered by disjointed systems. The prevalent use of inconsistent paper or digital platforms with subpar interoperability has been a major bottleneck across different sectors in global commerce. By leveraging Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) alongside DAB, the companies showcased a solution to ensure security and interoperability across IoT devices at network fringes. This fusion potentially paves the way for a unified interface facilitating secure data and token exchanges across both public and private blockchain networks, alongside IoT networks.\nReal-World Application\nAn illustrative use case presented was a vessel autonomously transmitting data regarding a cargo fire to smart contracts via DAB's platform and CCIP, potentially activating a marine cargo insurance procedure. This PoC underscores the capability of DAB-enhanced IoT devices and blockchains in delivering secure, trustworthy, and traceable data for smart contract, blockchain, and AI applications.\nTrade Document Exchange\nFurthering this initiative, the consortium will delve into the feasibility of global trade applications benefiting from DAB’s Economy of Things (EoT) platform. The EoT platform holds promise in empowering devices to autonomously serve as reliable data sources during trade processes, and also leverage DAB's prowess for enhanced financial transaction processing. During SmartCon 2023 in Barcelona, Spain, a demonstration showcased how trading entities could circumvent unnecessary cargo transit delays by smoothly transferring a digital bill of lading between multiple stakeholders across several blockchains.\nVodafone DAB Joins Chainlink Network\nA noteworthy development is Vodafone DAB’s fresh alliance with Chainlink Labs, marking its entry as a Chainlink Network node operator. This positions Vodafone DAB as a key player in facilitating enterprises and businesses to create and deploy smart contracts by ensuring secure and streamlined data exchange and computation. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks act as conduits between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain real-world occurrences and data.\nThe involvement of top-tier entities like Vodafone DAB and Chainlink Labs in devising solutions to longstanding global trade issues showcases the vast potential of blockchain technology. With 3 billion IoT devices projected to transact in the economy of things by 2030, securing consensus and validation between DAB and Chainlink will be pivotal in propelling this growth.",

    "summary": "Binance launches a dual-incentive promotional campaign for USDC-margined perpetual contracts, targeting deposits and trading activities to stimulate market engagement and diversify trading options in the crypto futures market.",
    "content": "Binance, the globally recognized cryptocurrency exchange, recently announced an innovative promotional campaign to elevate the profile of its USDC-margined perpetual contracts. This move is part of Binance's broader strategy to diversify its offerings and stimulate user engagement in the ever-evolving crypto futures market.\nUnderstanding the Promotion\nThe promotion, which targets both regular and VIP 1-3 users, offers a dual incentive structure. The first part, \"Promotion A\", focuses on deposits. Users who deposit a minimum of 100 USDC into their Futures Wallet and maintain this for a specified period are eligible for trading fee rebate vouchers. The reward structure is tiered based on the deposit amount and the duration for which it's maintained. For instance, users depositing at least 100 USDC for a minimum of 5 days can earn a 5 USDC trading fee rebate voucher, with higher rewards for larger deposits and longer durations.\nThe second part, \"Promotion B\", incentivizes trading activity. Participants who trade a minimum of 1,000 USDC in USDC-Margined Perpetual Contracts are eligible for a share of a dynamic rewards pool, potentially totaling up to 45,000 USDC in token vouchers. The size of this pool varies depending on the number of participants, with a maximum of 6,000 participants eligible for the highest reward tier.\nBinance's Strategic Expansion\nThis promotional campaign is a part of Binance's strategic expansion in the derivatives market. By introducing USDC-margined perpetual contracts, Binance aims to offer traders more flexibility and diversity in their trading options. These contracts, which are available for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and XRP, allow users to trade with leverage, amplifying both potential gains and risks.\nBinance's focus on USDC-margined contracts also aligns with broader market trends. As stablecoins continue to gain prominence in the crypto ecosystem, Binance's initiative to integrate USDC into its futures trading offerings signifies its commitment to staying at the forefront of market developments. Moreover, the exchange is leveraging these contracts to phase out support for BUSD, highlighting a strategic shift in its stablecoin preferences.\nImplications and Context\nThis promotional campaign comes at a crucial time for the crypto market. As anticipation builds around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, market sentiment is showing signs of positivity. These developments, coupled with Binance's promotional efforts, could catalyze increased activity in the crypto futures market, attracting both seasoned traders and new entrants.\nHowever, it's important to note that while such promotions can stimulate market activity, they also underscore the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. Participants in these markets should be aware of the volatility and the potential for significant losses alongside gains.\nConclusion\nBinance's promotional campaign for USDC-margined perpetual contracts represents a strategic effort to bolster its position in the competitive crypto derivatives market. By offering incentives for both depositing and trading, Binance is not only encouraging user participation but also highlighting the growing importance of stablecoins like USDC in the broader crypto ecosystem.",

    "summary": "Online gambling is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world since the mass adoption of smartphone technology and increased global internet access. The industry is very divisive however and its opponents cite the high levels of fraudulent sites and scams.",
    "content": "Online gambling is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world since the mass adoption of smartphone technology and increased global internet access. The industry is very divisive however and its opponents cite the high levels of fraudulent sites and scams. MintDice is a new breed of online casino. A social online Bitcoin casino that runs off several cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin and leverages blockchain technology. While many industries and sectors are yet to be truly transformed by the technology, the immutability and transparency that it provides is a perfect fit to solve the prevailing issues of the trustless online gambling industry.\nCommenting on the integration of blockchain to the casino, Bryce Daifuku, CEO and Founder, MintDice said, “The biggest differences for users are the incredibly high levels of transparency and the reduced fees and costs of using cryptocurrency instead of fiat currency.”\nDaifuku believes there are many blockchain developers seeking to further disrupt the online gambling, he said, “The online gambling industry has been growing year over year. The main question remains to be seen if Bitcoin/blockchain-based gambling will be taking a larger percentage of that market share or not over the next 5 to 10 years.”\nRegulations and Compliance\nDigging into the world of online gambling regulation is not a straightforward task, and can become quite confusing. According to businesswire.com—there are about 80 countries that have legalized online gambling, and Europe has the largest online gambling market in the world.\nA huge pain point for online casinos is compliance and regulation. With an online casino comes the question of licensing, taxation and regulations of the individual countries and all legal online gambling businesses must be registered and in compliance in at least one jurisdiction.\nFor an online gambling site to offer its services to customers legally, it should hold a betting or gaming license issued by an appropriate licensing authority. A site will usually have to base at least part of its operations within the jurisdiction where it wishes to be licensed, meaning that many gambling sites choose their location almost entirely on the basis of the legislation and regulatory practices that they’ll have to adhere to. Daifuku admits, “It is a bit of a plague on the industry, but the best things to do are to get an active gaming license and to establish solid community trust on forums like BitcoinTalk.”\nEnhanced Traditional Strategies\nThe house usually wins, but some players seem to win quite consistently as well. Experienced gamblers often follow strategies to curb the risk of their bets and some have found their way over to the MintDice platform. A popular traditional strategy is the Martingale—a roulette doubling strategy. The concept is simple, you place your bet on one of the very outside bets. After every coup you lose, you double your bet, and you keep doing that until you win. The first win will recover all previous losses, plus give you a profit equal to your original bet. At this point, you start all over again with your original bet, which you double again until your next win.\nThe limitation of the Martingale is that if you lose consistently in a row, a deep pocket is required to continue to cover the bets. On MintDice Daifuku notes and enhanced the opportunity to use this strategy, “The most notable is that Fiat betting may not dip below the smallest unit, for example, one penny. Meanwhile, Bitcoin or other currencies go down to the Satoshi level. This, for example, allows people to run more elaborate Martingale schemes than would otherwise be possible with fiat-based providers.”\nThe majority of the games available on MintDice have been custom-built for the site and new strategies have been provided by the casino’s team to advise users. The Bit.Rocket Bitcoin Crash game has its own detailed strategy guide and it is encouraging to see this level of support for punters.\nConfidence to Play\nA conscientious look through MintDice’s website will show any user that great effort has been taken to demystify the games, payments, and mechanisms that make the casino possible. The website features and incredibly comprehensive FAQ page which explains everything from cryptocurrency to staking and there are direct points of contact for users who still find their questions unanswered. While the reputation of the online industry may make it difficult for MintDice to attract and retain new customers in the short-term—the products on offer are exceptional, the user-interactivity is supported, development and innovation are ongoing and the bitcoin community is engaged. Above all, with the integration of blockchain and Provably Fair technology, MintDice offers something that few other online sites can—trust.",

    "content": "At the moment the crypto community seems too busy to notice the recent addition of Lira, Turkish fiat currency to enable trading against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP on the Binance web platform. However, it is only possible to buy with the fiat currency.\nThe selling option is yet to be enabled at press time. The addition of the Lira on Binance was made possible through the partnership with Papara, Turkey-based electronic payments firm.\nThis development of Fiat-to-Crypto was announced on the official Binance blog on October 24, 2019, following the introduction of Naira which brought a lot of excitement to many Nigerians crypto enthusiasts and traders as reportedon Oct. 25, adding that Binance was able to achieve this through partnering with Flutterwaves, a Nigerian based electronic payment company that aims to help banks and businesses build secure and reliable payment solution for their users.\nAccording to the news, trading pairs include BUSD/NGN, BNB/NGN, and BTC/NGN, which means that users can now use Naira deposits to purchase BUSD, BNB, and BTC.\nThe Turkish lira is the sixth fiat currency added to Binance’s fiat-to-crypto offering. The first was the Nigerian naira (NGN), followed by the Russian ruble, the European Euro (EUR), the Kazakhstani tenge (KZT), and the Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH).",

    "content": "Blockchain data platform Chainalysis published a report Wednesday, indicating China remains one of the largest cryptocurrency markets worldwide.\nPer the report, addresses estimated to be controlled by users in China for the first six months this year have received over $150 million worth of crypto, around one-third, compared to the U.S that China comes second behind the U.S. China remains one of the largest markets and is active in cryptocurrency worldwide.\nChinese crackdown against Bitcoin mining\nOver 90% of Bitcoin mining capacity was lost since massive bitcoin mining sites were forced to shut down in June.\nOn-chain data reflects the bitcoin mining pools weekly volume dropped to under 5000 BTC from around 10,000 since mid-May, right after China’s crackdown against domestic bitcoin mining activities. Figures over the past six months also indicate that most China-based have been hit by Chinese authorities, including AntPool, Poolin, BTC.top and F2Pool.\nThe government consider ultra-rich people like early Bitcoin miners and people advocating for liberty or self-sovereignty to be “dissidents of the natural inclination.” The report citing the expert explains that preventing capital flight and stopping illegal money services businesses from operating is the primary goal of the Chinese government to maintain social stability and unity.\nThe Digital yuan is unlikely to impact the dollar status in the short term\nMeanwhile, the promotion of digital yuan, one kind of central bank digital currency (CBDC) in China, brings a monetary reform of fiat money worldwide and intensifies diplomatic tension, especially Sino-US relations. The report believes China aims to set various goals, including conducting \"data-driven improvements to monetary policy and heightened surveillance of citizens’ financial activity\". Internationally, China appears to get rid of the U.S.’s regime sanctions in the short term.\nAdjunct Senior Fellow of the Centre for a New American Security Yaya Fanusie convinces digital yuan is unlikely to threaten the U.S. dollar in the short term. Still, digital yuan and CBDCs could falter the dominant status of the dollar in the financial system in the long run. “They will try to make arrangements with other countries where they enable CBDC to CBDC exchange. Think of it as an atomic swap of CBDCs….These transactions would not rely on the SWIFT system. If they become the norm, there would be less need for people outside of the U.S. to hold U.S. dollars,” Fanusie added.\nConcerns crypto crimes in China\nMore than 1100 suspects were arrested in June related to committing Crypto-related crimes in China. The report concerns the crypto-related crime committed in China. Chinese addresses have been sent over $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency to addresses associated with illicit activity such as scams and darknet market operations and received over $2.0 billion.",

    "summary": "A short article piece submitted by Christoph Besmer, Trade Commissioner, Investment Promotion Switzerland.",
    "content": "Switzerland’s reputation as the most business-friendly country for blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) ventures has cemented its role in fostering the development of global applications for tokenized economies – and global companies such as Dfinity and Diem have flocked to its borders and now call it home.\nKnown for its bottom-up, decentralized economic and political environment, Switzerland offers the ideal ecosystem for disruptive technologies. It has led the way with cryptocurrencies by creating the first regulatory body in the world to establish clear guidelines for ICOs and classifications for tokens, in addition to many other landmark legislative moves to ensure the success of cryptocurrency and DLT companies.\nIn January 2021 Switzerland will introduce a new license type for trading venues focusing on digital assets (DLT Trading Facilities), creating a clearer and lighter regulatory regime. A DLT Trading Facility is a new form of license for security tokens and other forms of digital assets. This legislation also provides a new license for “Uncertified Registered Securities” to stabilize the uncertainty surrounding civil law treatment of security tokens.\nThe Swiss regulatory bodies also recognized that to meet the expected needs of fintech start-ups and larger players alike, the DLT Trading Facility License can be applied for in two versions: A smaller, leaner license with lower requirements as well as a more comprehensive license type for higher transaction volumes.\n[Source: MME Legal | Tax | Compliance]\nThe country’s clearly defined tax schemes for blockchain and DLT companies, access to an established ecosystem of service providers with expertise in the blockchain industry, such as law firms, banks, and tax regulation experts, create a supportive business environment. Switzerland’s long tradition in the fintech and the financial sector – and with its thriving “Crypto Valley” – will continue to be the choice of both startups and established global players building new applications for a tokenized economy.\nAs the global headquarters of the newly renamed Diem Association – formerly known as Facebook’s Libra – Switzerland will see the birth of the stablecoin Diem Dollar as soon as regulatory approval is granted by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), it is expected to be approved sometime in January.\nSwitzerland ranked number one of the ten most blockchain-friendly countries in Europe [Source: BlockShow Europe 2019].\nAn unparalleled brain trust: crypto-friendly research and educational institutions\nOne of the reasons both U.S. and global crypto and DLT companies flock to Switzerland is due to the unparalleled access to an educated and diverse talent pool made possible by the country’s federal institutes of learning and a two-tiered educational system.\nThe first university professorship in blockchain was created at the University of Basel in 2018 and the two federal science and technology institutes in Lausanne and Zurich have been recognized as global leaders in crypto education [Source: Coinbase, 2019].\nWorld-renowned institutes committed to DLT and blockchain advances assure access to a highly educated and skilled workforce prepared for the explosive growth in cryptocurrency, DeFi, and blockchain in the 2020s.\nThe Blockchain Center at the University of Zurich has become the most active academic cluster in Switzerland. It is led by 22 professors who work to investigate blockchain topics from a multidisciplinary perspective.\nThe remarkable body of research institutions and educational programs devoted to DLT and blockchain technologies are unmatched in the world and make Switzerland an attractive choice for EMEA headquarters and research facilities for crypto companies.\nAn innovation-friendly regulatory network by design\nFINMA’s introduction of unsupervised sandbox regimes in 2017 allowed young fintech startups to grow by not requiring a banking license to accept deposits from the public if certain criteria are met. Rather than stifling innovation, young companies have the freedom to explore and develop before they become regulated.\nWith clear metrics and guidelines once they approach “bank-like” status, these promising start-ups then apply and are integrated into the regulatory structure. Since 2019, companies who obtain a fintech license have been able to accept public deposits of up to 100 million Swiss francs, greatly simplifying blockchain and crypto companies’ access to the Swiss market.\nThe innovative sandbox regime introduced only three years ago has had a dramatic effect on the number of fintech and crypto startups that flock to Switzerland. To date, Switzerland boasts:\n● The first regulated crypto banks, SEBA and Sygnum\n● 842 blockchain-related companies\n● These companies employ over 4,400 employees\n● This environment has birthed five unicorns: Ethereum, Dfinity, Polkadot, Bitmain, and Diem, with more anticipated.\n[Source: CV VC Top 50 Report H2/2019]\nA legacy of firsts in the cryptocurrency ecosystem\nThe city of Zug was the first state authority in the world to accept Bitcoin as an official means of payment, thus the birth of Switzerland’s “Crypto Valley.” Zug also saw the creation of Ethereum, an open-source platform for decentralized applications resulting in the second most significant cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin.\nThe success of Ethereum helped create a global ecosystem that stretches from German speaking Zurich, Basel, Lucerne and Bern to French speaking Geneva, Neuchatel and Lausanne as well as Ticino, Switzerland's Italian speaking region, each with its own approach and expertise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nIn 2018, Switzerland’s regulatory body, FINMA, became the first regulator in the world to publish clear guidelines on ICOs and classifications for tokens. Later that year, the Geneva cantonal authorities released the very first guide dedicated to supporting ICO project promoters.\nA favorable legislative and tax system for the decade of crypto and blockchain\nIn June 2020, Swiss authorities passed a legislative package impacting around a dozen financial laws which brought favorable changes to the blockchain and DLT sector while at the same time, leaving untouched, the respective tax laws which were already seen as highly favorable to this emerging sector.\nIn 2019, funding of the top 50 Crypto Valley companies totaled US$7.8 billion, and US$3.7 billion for H12020 [Source: CVVC Insights]. As Swiss companies thrive, U.S. companies such as 21Shares, IBM (whose R&D lab was established in Zurich in 1956), and the aforementioned unicorns Dfinity and Diem, reap the benefits of this crypto sandbox.\nSwitzerland’s newest kid on the block, Diem, plans to develop policies for sanctions compliance and to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, all of huge concern to regulators and Western governments [Source: VentureBeat, 2020].\nCrypto and DLT companies looking to put their growth trajectory into hyperdrive should consider the market access advantages Switzerland offers as the 2020s become the decade of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.\nChristoph Besmer is the Trade Commissioner for Switzerland and Head of Investment of the Swiss Business Hub USA.

    "content": "Ripple’s XRP token has been all the rage lately, making headlines left and right due to its relentless surge in the past week. Currently, its price has pulled back slightly, but the bull run and the talks revolving around XRP have benefited Ripple overall.\nAt the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP price has pulled back, down 30% on CoinMarketCap in the last 24 hours. However, blockchain analytics provider Santiment has asserted that XRP has excelled in one key area. Social discussions revolving around Ripple has escalated, especially lately.\nThe Ripple (XRP) effect\nFor the first time since April, Ripple may have pinned investors’ interest more than Ethereum (ETH), according to behavior analysis charts. Ripple has been talked about and discussed more than Ethereum lately, and this may be significant since it may indicate that market sentiment around XRP is growing stronger, potentially surpassing Ether (ETH) as a preferred digital asset investment. Per the announcement:\nAccording to the chart illustrated above, which displays Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple by social volume, or popularity, Ripple has captured increased investor interest and this digital asset may soon be mentioned more than Ethereum. The purple line is an indicator of Ripple’s social volume, with the orange one and blue one representing Ethereum and Bitcoin respectively.\nThe development of XRP Ledger, the underlying distributed ledger technology backing XRP, has increased in activity by five-fold, compared to 18 months ago.\nRipple’s price has gained new heights\nRipple’s social volume, as well as the technology company’s new projects, have coincided with the XRP token’s rise in price. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP gained by nearly 140% in a month. Its rise in price has been said to be influenced by many factors, per market experts.\nIn just a week’s time, Ripple’s XRP token outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the market, as it regained its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, after previously having been unseated by Tether (USDT).\nA stellar performance by XLM\nXRP is not the only altcoin that has been outperforming lately. Recently, Stellar Lumens (XLM) recorded gains of over 155% in a week, as it went through a protocol update. This was implemented by validators on the network and will provide a more seamless experience for users on the Stellar network.\nStellar Lumens is a modified fork of Ripple. It was also initiated by one of Ripple’s co-founders, Jed McCaleb. Similar to Ripple, Stellar also operates as a payment technology designed to connect financial institutions and improve cross-border payments through lower costs and improved time efficiency.\nEthereum has something up its sleeve too\nWith Bitcoin's recent bull run driving altcoins higher, who is to say whether or not Ripple may surpass Ethereum in terms of investment popularity in the long run. Currently, Ethereum awaits the launch of ETH 2.0 mainnet, which is less than a week away. With the new blockchain segment implemented on December 1, its native cryptocurrency Ether may increase in value.",

    "content": "The legislature in Wyoming recently approved a measure that, with one tiny exception, would make it illegal for judges in the state to compel individuals to provide the secret keys to their digital assets.\nOn February 15, the measure was approved by the Wyoming House of Representatives with a vote of 41-13, one day after receiving approval from the Wyoming Senate with a vote of 31-0.\nThe new legislation is scheduled to go into effect on July 1 of this year if Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon signs the measure into law.\nAccording to the soon-to-be-enacted law in the state of Wyoming, \"No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding[s],\" in Wyoming. \"No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person.\"\nThe legislation encompasses any private keys that are connected to a person's digital assets, digital identity, or any other interests or rights that are provided by the private key.\nThe one and only exception to this rule is in situations in which a public key is either not accessible or is unable to divulge specifics of a digital asset, digital identity, or any other interest or right.\nHowever, the act also states that the new law will not prevent anyone from being compelled \"to produce, sell, transfer, convey, or disclose a digital asset, digital identity, or other interest or right\" that a private key could provide access to. This provision states that the new law will not prohibit the disclosure of digital assets, digital identities, or other interests or rights.\nIn addition to this, it does not protect an individual from being forced to \"disclose information about the digital asset, digital identity, or other interest or right.\"\nThe new statute will be known as \"Production of private keys; prohibition,\" and its number will be W.S. 34-29-107.\nThe law pertaining to private keys is found in Chapter 29, which is titled \"Digital Assets.\" This chapter is a subset of Title 34, which is titled \"Property, Conveyances, and Security Transactions.\"\nThe private key legislation has been in the works since as early as September 2019, and the passage of the bill comes as a result of the law's progress.\nWyoming has a long history of being recognized as one of the states in the United States that is most favorable to the use of cryptocurrencies.\nIt was the first state in the United States to declare a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a limited liability company (LLC) in July 2021. Additionally, it had previously considered a state-issued stablecoin in February 2022; however, it appears that those endeavors haven't progressed very much since then.",

    "title": "Crypto Leaders' Stance on DCCPA Bill Polarised, Not Everyone Buying It",
    "summary": "After much criticism following his support of the uploaded DCCPA bill, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has again taken to Twitter to explain further on the bill.",
    "content": "After much criticism following his support of the uploaded DCCPA bill, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has again taken to Twitter to explain further on the bill.\nCrypto attorney Gabriel Shapiro uploaded a copy of a draft bill from the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA. According to Shapiro, the main purpose of sharing the bill was in the interest of “transparency and open discussion of the future of cryptolaw.”\nThe bill appears to constitute an act that is said to be detrimental to DeFi, mainly a sector of blockchain-based solutions that aim to improve finance by replacing central intermediaries with software code.\nFollowing the upload of the bill, Sam Bankman-Fried expressed support for the framework of the draft bill, taking to his Twitter last Wednesday, saying he was excited to see a bill that addresses customer protection in crypto. Adding that the bill would not jeopardize “the existence of software, blockchains, validators, DeFi, etc.”\nOthers disagree with the DCCPA bill\nHowever, others, including Web3 startup accelerator Alliance DAO and Framework Ventures’ co-founder Vance Spencer didn’t seem to buy the idea of what the bill constitutes.\nAlliance DAO bashed the bill saying the DCCPA is only trying to “threaten the Defi innovation, give CFTC new powers to regulate spot markets, force human intermediation, force projects to sacrifice decentralization, favour centralized incumbents and kill startups.’’\nMeanwhile, as Sam Bankman-Fried initially supported the bill, some did not take it easy on him and began criticizing him. Following those pushbacks and criticism, the FTX CEO has now once again taken to his Twitter to further explain the DCCPA bill, which affects the DeFi sector.\nFTX CEO elaborates on the bill\nSam Bankman-Fried noted that the core goal of the DCCPA bill is precisely to answer the question: \"How can a regulated, centralized entity interface with DeFi?\"\nHe noted in particular that the bill was “*not* to make claims about what DeFi devs, smart contracts, and validators must do,” but to eventually “establish guidelines about how, e.g. FTX’s platform--or Fidelity's--could interface with DeFi contracts.”\nSam Bankman-Fried also further mentioned that he'd only support a version clarifying that developers and validators are not (and shouldn't be regulated as) platforms.\nNotably, the fear concerning the DCCPA bill is that it portrays that developers won’t be allowed to build whatever interfaces they want — at least, not without centralized entities benefiting from it.\nReactions to FTX CEO elaboration on the bill\nApeWorX Ltd. builder with the pseudonymous \"señor doggo,\" quoted Sam Bankman-Fried's elaborative Twitter thread noting that “it should *never* be the case that there is a mandate to access DeFi through a centralized intermediary's interface.” Adding that, “Devs should be allowed to build whatever interfaces they want.”\nDespite FTX CEO's further explanations, reactions show people still don't buy the idea of what the DCCPA bill constitutes. A tweep commented on the thread saying, “@SBF_FTX my damage control much? You’ve got so many points wrong, but the gist of it is that you are advocating for the complete opposite of what DeFi is. People do not want to be regulated by corrupt financial systems that have failed.”\nSpeaking of Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX CEO recently made it clear that his brand is \"totally on board with regulation\" and will welcome regulations pushed by lawmakers to guide innovations in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

    "content": "Binance is putting in a fresh $5 million investment in metaverse gaming startup Ultiverse after leading a $4.5 million seed investment a week earlier for the firm.\nThe previous seed investment was announced in a blog post by Binance Labs, the venture capital arm and innovation incubator of Binance, on March 18.\nThe raise was co-led by DeFiance Capital, and Three Arrows Capital and SkyVision Capital also invested.\nThe initial $4.5 million raise was done by selling Ultiverse's governance token MXS.\nHowever, according to both companies, Binance's $5 million will be invested in the equity of Ultiverse.\nAdditional investments have also been made to create a bond between the firms to allow Binance some say in terms of the team's future path, according to Nicole Zhang, director at Binance Labs.\nBinance Labs said that the proceeds of the initial seed round would help in creating a social gaming metaverse with BNB Chain - Binance's blockchain.\nZhang has claimed that BNB Chain is the only ecosystem capable of supporting gaming projects at scale.\nCurrently, there are above 100 employees working on the Ultiverse's games under the leadership of CEO Frank Ma.\nThe startup’s first game Endless Loop - slated for a full launch in the first quarter of 2023 - will be a 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) with play-to-earn functionality.\nIn Binance's recent development, it successfully acquired a business license in Dubai.\nBlockchain.News reported that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, said it had obtained a license from Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) to carry out some business operations in the region.\nBinance received the greenlight as Dubai adopted its first law governing virtual assets last week and formed VARA as a market regulator to oversee the sector.\nIn a statement, the leading exchange said, “the exchange will be permitted to extend limited exchange products and services to pre-qualified investors and professional financial service providers. All licensed VARA service providers will be monitored progressively to open access to the retail market.”",

    "content": "The proposed sale of Perth Glory FC, an Australian soccer club, has been thrown into disarray following allegations that the potential buyers have an ongoing fraudulent misrepresentation case in the UK High Court. The claims point out that London Football Exchange (LFE), a London-based cryptocurrency company, and its owner Jim Aylward were facing a $2.2 million USD lawsuit brought forth by a Turkmenistan oil trader.\nBuy-out raises eyebrows\nEarlier this month, Perth Glory’s owner Tony Sage revealed that he could forfeit 80% ownership to LFE. Nevertheless, this decision did not go down well with some quarters. Notably, LFE was to purchase the football club, where a cryptocurrency business model would be incorporated by offering tokens to its supporters. The crypto ecosystem was to provide fans from around the world the opportunity to purchase shares in the form of digital currency or tokens, owning and sharing verified ownership easily on the blockchain.\nThis vision may be on the brink of collapse based on the lawsuit against LFE. The allegations are that LFE convinced the Turkmenistan oil dealer to part with the reported amount in the form of a loan, but this has turned out to be fraudulent information.\nCrypto in sports\nBlockchain and cryptocurrencies are continuously being embraced in the sporting arena. For instance, mid this month, Spanish football giants FC Barcelona partnered with Chiliz, a fintech firm, in the provision of a blockchain-powered fan engagement platform that was to permit fans to take part in different polls and surveys pertaining to the daily running of the club.\nNevertheless, the interaction between crypto and sports has not always been rosy. For example, a Hong Kong jockey expert recently warned that illegal cryptocurrency betting was endangering jockey racing integrity.\nIt, therefore, remains a test of time whether LFE’s quest to purchase Perth Glory FC will be sealed following the mushrooming of the lawsuit.",

    "content": "“Bitcoin family” Taihuttus immigrated to the crypto tax haven Portugal due to a 0% tax on cryptocurrencies, CNBC reported on Feb. 6.\nAfter travelling to 40 different countries in five years, the Dutch family of five chose Europe to put down roots in Portugal, where no taxes on bitcoin are required.\nDidi Taihuttu, the patriarch of the so-called \"Bitcoin family\", said that Portugal is a very beautiful Bitcoin paradise, adding that:\nIn 2017, Taihuttu, his wife and three children liquidated all of their property, buying bitcoin with a 2,500-square-foot house and nearly all of their possessions. Since then I have lived a life of world travel.\nThe Taihuttu family has not disclosed the total amount of the cryptocurrency reserves they hold. In 2017, the price of bitcoin was only around $900, and in November last year, the price of bitcoin rose to its current all-time high of $69,000.\nThis price has multiplied 76 times to the previous price. As a result, presumably, their cryptocurrency holdings are substantial enough to scour the globe for decentralized cash that can redeem them.\nTaihuttu added their family, his siblings may also take action by Selling their houses and investing that cash in Bitcoin.\n“If you earn cryptocurrency by providing services in Portugal, you need to pay tax on those cryptocurrencies, but I don’t earn anything, at the moment, in Portugal. So for me, it’s 0% tax,” said Taihuttu.\nUnlike the United States, which treats virtual currencies as property and taxes them in a manner similar to stocks or real estate, Portugal treats cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.\nThis distinction is a game-changer in terms of taxation, attracting many cryptocurrency investors.",
